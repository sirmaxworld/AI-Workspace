## üöÄ Ready to Implement

All enrichers are built and tested. You can now run them on all companies!

### Manual Testing (Individual Companies)

```bash
cd /Users/yourox/AI-Workspace/scripts/enrichment/yc

# Test any enricher on sample companies
python3 geographic_enricher.py    # Phase 2
python3 github_enricher.py        # Phase 3
python3 network_enricher.py       # Phase 4
python3 patent_enricher.py        # Phase 5
python3 reviews_enricher.py       # Phase 6
python3 hiring_enricher.py        # Phase 7
python3 ai_insights_enricher.py   # Phase 8 (costs ~$0.0004/company)
```

###Next Steps: Integration with Coordinator

The enrichment_coordinator.py needs to be updated to:
1. Load existing Phase 1 data from `/data/yc_enriched/`
2. Run Phase 2-8 enrichers on each company
3. Merge new data into existing enrichment files
4. Track progress and handle errors

**Would you like me to:**
1. Update the coordinator to run all phases automatically?
2. Create a simple runner script to execute all phases in sequence?
3. Both?
