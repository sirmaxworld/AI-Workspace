## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Historical)
```python
# For each subreddit, for each week in past year:
- Fetch top 100 posts from that week (sorted by 'top')
- Fetch top 3 comments from each post
- Store raw data locally
```

**API Constraints:**
- Reddit API: 100 requests/min, 10K/day
- Can fetch ~2,000 posts per day
- **Timeline**: ~2-3 weeks to fetch all historical data

### Phase 2: Analysis Pipeline
```python
# For each week's data:
1. Engagement metrics (simple counting)
2. Sentiment analysis (VADER/transformers)
3. Topic extraction (LDA/BERTopic)
4. Entity recognition (spaCy/NER)
5. Pattern matching (regex for pain points, questions)
6. Aggregation and scoring
```

### Phase 3: Storage & Visualization
```sql
-- Database schema
CREATE TABLE reddit_weekly_snapshots (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  subreddit VARCHAR(100),
  week VARCHAR(10),
  snapshot_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_subreddit_week ON reddit_weekly_snapshots(subreddit, week);
```
