## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. The System Is Already Installed!

All components are in place:
- ✅ Database: `/Users/yourox/AI-Workspace/data/ai_sessions/`
- ✅ Scripts: `/Users/yourox/AI-Workspace/scripts/ai_*.py`

- ⚠️ "You often forget to check for null values"
- ℹ️ "You work mostly with TypeScript files"

### 3. Important Decisions

**Example:**
- **Decision:** "Using Redis for caching"
- **Rationale:** "Faster than memcached, better data structure support"
- **When:** Oct 17, 2025
- **Searchable:** Next time you wonder "why did we choose Redis?"

### 4. Insights & Tips

**Auto-detected phrases:**
- "Learned that..."
- "Important to..."

## 🎯 Real Usage Examples

### Example 1: Remembering Past Solutions

**You:** "I'm getting a CORS error in my React app. Have I fixed this before?"

**AI Session Logger:** Searches your history and finds:
```
✅ Found 2 similar sessions:

Session 1 (Oct 10, 2025):
- Error: CORS policy blocking requests
- Solution: Added proxy in package.json
- Code: "proxy": "http://localhost:3000"

Session 2 (Oct 5, 2025):
- Error: CORS in production
- Solution: Configured nginx headers
```

### Example 2: Understanding Your Patterns

**You:** "What are my coding patterns?"

**AI Session Logger:**
```
📊 Your Patterns:

✅ Good Habits:
- You practice TDD (8 sessions)
- You use conventional commits (12 commits)
- You document decisions (5 recorded)

⚠️ Areas for Improvement:
- Common error: ModuleNotFoundError (4x)
  → Suggestion: Consider requirements.txt

ℹ️ Style:
- Primarily works with .tsx files
- Prefers async/await over promises
```

### Example 3: Daily Summary

**You:** "Generate my daily summary"

**AI Session Logger:**
```markdown
# Daily Summary - 2025-10-17

## 📊 Activity
- Commits: 3
- Files Modified: 12
- Coding Activities: 8

## 💻 Recent Commits
- feat: Add AI session logger

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Record Decisions Manually**
   When you make important choices, use `record_decision` tool

2. **Review Weekly**
   Ask for weekly summaries to track progress

3. **Query Before Starting**
   "Have I built something similar before?"

4. **Learn from Patterns**
   Check your patterns monthly to improve

5. **Trust the System**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### System not capturing?
- Check: Is git initialized in your project?
- Check: Are you making commits?
- Solution: System needs git activity to learn from

### No learnings appearing?
- Reason: Takes time to build up data
- Solution: Keep coding, check again in a few days

### MCP server not responding?
- Solution: Restart Claude Desktop
- Check: `/Users/yourox/AI-Workspace/mcp_servers/coding_history_config.json`
