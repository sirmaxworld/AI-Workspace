## Recommendations

### Phase 3: Build Custom Scrapers (High Priority)

**Target these 10 high-value sources without RSS:**

1. **Business Intelligence:**
   - McKinsey Quarterly (consulting insights)
   - LinkedIn Sales Blog (sales strategies)
   - Gong Blog (sales intelligence)

2. **Entrepreneurship:**
   - Inc.com (fix 403 issue with better user agents/proxies)
   - Entrepreneur (fix timeout with better handling)
   - Bloomberg (limited scraping for free content)

3. **SME:**
   - Business Matters (adjust filters - content is there)
   - Real Business (adjust filters)

4. **Marketing:**
   - Marketing Profs (fix 404 URL)
   - Content Marketing Institute (fix scraper)

### Phase 4: API Integrations (Medium Priority)

**Educational content (if desired):**
- Coursera API
- edX API
- Udemy API
- Insight Timer API

### Phase 5: Lower Quality Filtering (Low Priority)

**Recover filtered content:**
- Reduce minimum word count from 30 to 10 words
- Allow shorter comedy/satirical content (The Onion, Reddit)
- Accept more Google AI Blog posts
