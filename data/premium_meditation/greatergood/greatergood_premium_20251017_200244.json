      "content_text": "In a time when corruption no longer hides its face and political violence is becoming routine, outrage has become the default language of public life. Equanimity may seem irrelevant\u2014or, worse, complicit. What kind of person stays calm in the face of injustice? Who, in their right mind, resists the pull toward righteous indignation when world leaders violate every essential norm of human decency? And yet, I\u2019d like to suggest something quietly radical: that equanimity, rightly understood, is not passivity\u2014but resistance. A deeper kind of resistance. One that refuses to be hijacked by the very forces it seeks to oppose. A few months ago, I met john a. powell (who does not capitalize the letters of his name) at a backyard get-together. Given his position as director of the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley and as a prominent voice for equity, I expected our conversation\u2014centered on funding cuts and Department of Justice investigations into colleagues at UC Berkeley\u2014to be tinged with shared outrage. But john didn\u2019t meet my indignation with more fire. He simply smiled\u2014a true \u201cDuchenne\u201d smile\u2014and said, \u201cI just stick to my values.\u201d Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month That sentence has echoed in me ever since. It clarified something I had only been circling: that equanimity is an act of resistance, an assertion of dignity. It is the quiet refusal to be swept up in the emotional hyper-reactivity that so often masquerades as moral clarity. It is not indifference\u2014it is passion tempered with wisdom. Not detachment\u2014but perspective. Outrage and the illusion of clarity Outrage feels good, at least at first. It is hot, energizing, thrilling. It releases adrenaline, cortisol, testosterone\u2014priming us to argue, dominate, and act. But it comes at a cost. Physiologically, outrage taxes our bodies. Cognitively, it narrows our perception, distorting what we see and hear and what we believe about others. When I\u2019m in the grip of anger or indignation\u2014at a partner, a public figure, or the world\u2014I lose the ability to see nuance. I see enemies instead of people. I lose the thread of complexity and collapse into monovision. Outrage can easily become its own kind of addiction, a self-reinforcing loop where the more morally outraged we are, the more righteous we feel. In places like Berkeley, where I live, this has become a kind of social currency\u2014a way of signaling virtue and belonging. But what does it accomplish ? Too often, righteous indignation calcifies into zealotry: the fanatical, uncompromising pursuit of our ideals. History shows us where that leads\u2014violence, exclusion, contempt. And here\u2019s the hardest part to swallow: in our most indignant moments, we can begin to enact the very qualities we\u2019re condemning in others. The same absolutism. The same disdain for difference. The same dehumanization. The same blind certainty. Equanimity as moral resistance So what makes us vulnerable to the kind of anger that slips into contempt or even cruelty? For me, it often begins in shame. Quiet Strength: Find Peace, Feel Alive, and Love Boundlessly Through the Power of Equanimity (HarperOne, 2026, 336 pages) When I reflect honestly, I notice that my most volatile reactions are tied to things I hate in myself\u2014places I\u2019ve missed the mark or failed to live up to my own ideals. Outrage becomes a shield, a projection, a way of disowning what is hard to face internally. There is little that is harder than facing the parts of myself that in any way resemble our current president. It is far easier to condemn greed, narcissism, contempt, and cruelty in the abstract than to look at the ways they show up in my own life. Easier to demonize the other than to wrestle with my own complicity. And yet, this is where equanimity can begin\u2014not in superiority, but in humbleness. To me, equanimity is not apathy. It is not a flattening of emotion or a retreat from the world. Rather, it is the ability to stay rooted in our values while engaging with the world as it is. john powell reminded me of this with his Duchenne smile. Equanimity, he reminded me, is not a cop-out\u2014it is a necessity in times of moral collapse. When outrage becomes habitual, it becomes ineffective and draining. Even outrage can become complacent\u2014performative rather than sincere. But equanimity, especially when paired with courage and clarity, becomes a platform for more skillful and enduring forms of action. It allows us to see more clearly, speak more effectively, and love more fiercely. When I imagine doubling down on my own integrity\u2014not as withdrawal, but as resistance \u2014I feel the ground of equanimity beneath me. It doesn\u2019t make me passive. It makes me effective. The work ahead Toward the end of my upcoming book on equanimity , I have a chapter on connecting the dots between living an ethical life and finding equanimity. I share some deeply personal stories about learning\u2014usually the hard way\u2014how my own unethical behavior gave rise to anxiety and agitation. The link between the two is unmistakable, and nowhere is it more apparent than when you sit down to meditate. Simply put: Unethical conduct breeds agitation; ethical conduct fosters peace. And agitation is fertile ground for outrage and projection to take root. Throw in some social media and global instability, and you are well on your way to zealotry. Peace is fertile ground for perspective and clarity to grow. Toss in some honest self-reflection and an intention for greater integrity, and you can harness the energy of outrage toward creative solutions and effective engagement. The world doesn\u2019t need more anger. It doesn\u2019t need more contempt, or more zealotry, however righteous. It needs people who can hold the fire of moral clarity without burning others to the ground. It needs people who can stay close to suffering without becoming consumed by it. It needs people who can see clearly without collapsing into cynicism or despair. It needs, perhaps, more equanimity\u2014not as escape, but as a radical refusal to be consumed by the very forces we seek to confront. When the fires rise, and the outrage surges, ask yourself this: Can I stick to my values without succumbing to the dopamine rush of indignation? Can I stay awake and engaged\u2014without becoming what I oppose? That, I believe, is the quiet power of equanimity.

      "content_text": "What is your relationship with your emotions on a daily basis? Some of us might deny that we\u2019re influenced by our feelings at all. Others might try to leave our emotions behind when we move into certain environments, like work or school. We may believe that particular emotions are \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d\u2014and so aim to avoid them as much as possible. But according to Marc Brackett, founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of the new book Dealing with Feeling , emotions are around whether we like them to be or not\u2014and our skill in dealing with them will influence how much success and well-being we can attain. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month His book explains how we can work with our emotions so they don\u2019t get in the way of us achieving our goals or living the life we want. Emotion regulation is a skill that we should start learning in childhood, he argues\u2014 but many of us must revisit it as adults because no one really showed or taught us how. Here is an edited version of my conversation with Brackett, where he explains in detail what this skill can look like in our daily lives and what to do in the moment when a difficult emotion arises. This is the first part of a longer conversation\u2014you can read the second part about how an ideal society would teach this skill to kids . Kira M. Newman: What is emotion regulation? Marc Brackett, Ph.D. Marc Brackett: Emotion regulation in its simplest form are the strategies that we use to manage our feelings to achieve good relationships, well-being, and goals. It includes thoughts and actions; we can shift our emotions by changing the way we think and by doing things. I have an acronym PRIME: We can Prevent unwanted emotions, Reduce difficult ones, Initiate ones that we want to feel, Maintain the ones that we want to keep, and Enhance other ones. Essentially, emotion regulation is a set of goals and strategies that are a function of whatever feeling we\u2019re having, who we are as a person, and the situation that we\u2019re in. That combination is helpful because you can start mapping it out: For example, I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019m an introvert, and I\u2019m being asked to go to a party. How do you say no, or make choices for yourself? Knowing that I\u2019m an introvert\u2014who, when he\u2019s tired, likes to rejuvenate, not expend more energy\u2014I\u2019ll make the choice to go home or go to a yoga class or take a walk or go out for dinner with a friend, as opposed to go to a club, go to a sports bar, or hang out with lots of people. The more we know who we are in terms of our personality, the better able we\u2019ll be to choose strategies that can work for us to help us manage emotions better. The other piece is culture. Some cultures have different methods, and there\u2019s no wrong or right. There\u2019s one criterion that you have to look for, which is am I hurting myself, or am I hurting other people? Other than that, the world is your limit in terms of regulation. KMN: What does an emotionally regulated person look like? How do we know when we\u2019re sufficiently regulating our emotions? MB: They look like any person except that they\u2019re in a place where they are not thrown by their emotions. Let\u2019s start with what they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not yelling, screaming, saying unkind things, being mean and hurtful. They\u2019re also not self-denigrating or ruminating extensively or denying or ignoring or suppressing emotions, nor are they using substances to regulate. What they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re using healthy strategies to manage their emotions. They\u2019re noticing what their feelings are. They\u2019re asking themselves questions about the helpfulness or not of those feelings. And then they are choosing helpful strategies. KMN: What does emotion regulation feel like as a habit integrated into our daily lives? Do we stop and respond to every feeling that we have? MB: A lot of our emotion regulation is automatic; it\u2019s unconscious. We\u2019re working on a project and we get a little overwhelmed, and we take a deep breath. We didn\u2019t even think about that. Or we decide we need a break and we\u2019re going to go for a walk. Do all emotions need regulation? The answer is no. Otherwise, we\u2019d go crazy. We don\u2019t want to be attending to our emotions all day long; I think that would be unhelpful. What we want to do is notice if we\u2019re having a strong emotion that is interfering with a goal. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re at home and you get into a fight with your dog or your partner or your kid, and then you\u2019re going into an important meeting at work. That\u2019s a good opportunity to say, OK, I\u2019m really angry at my son and I don\u2019t want to sit with that anger in that meeting, so I\u2019m going to take my breath, and I\u2019m going to attribute my anger to what happened this morning and not allow it to have power over my conversation that\u2019s coming up. Those are the opportune moments for both emotion check-ins and emotion regulation\u2014when you notice a shift or when you are going to be doing something important. I did this podcast with a lot of followers, and I wanted to be the best version of myself. So before I walked in the door, I took a breath and I\u2019m like, How are you feeling, Marc? Are you nervous? Are you excited? Are you overwhelmed? And I was feeling tired and a little overwhelmed. And I said, Well, how do you want to show up? What emotion is going to best serve you for this interview? Well, I want to be inspiring, and I want to be connected to the interviewer. OK. So what\u2019s your strategy for getting there? That to me is what emotion regulation is all about. KMN: Certain feelings seem to be about what they\u2019re about, and certain feelings seem to be echoes of past wounds or triggers. Is there a difference in how you deal with those types of feelings? Dealing with Feeling: Use Your Emotions to Create the Life You Want (Celadon Books, 2025, 320 pages) MB: I think what you\u2019re getting at are feelings versus emotions. Our experience of any instance of emotion is always connected to our history. We have these accumulated instances of feeling a certain way about a certain person or getting angry, sad, fearful, surprised, and it\u2019s like an accumulation of all of your life is coming up in that one little emotion. That\u2019s important because it means that it\u2019s a learned experience, and then you can evaluate if your responses are helpful or unhelpful or adaptive or maladaptive to your well-being and then make a choice to say, OK, I need to step back and reappraise or learn a more helpful way of dealing with this emotion or feeling. For example, I grew up with a father who had a lot of anger, and he was aggressive with his anger. His facial expression was strong; his behavior was, in my view, inappropriate. So I\u2019m sensitive to anger. My relationship to anger might be different from someone else who grew up with a father who was very gentle. I have a different representation of anger in my brain. My representation for anger is like Run away because danger is happening , whereas someone else might not have that same reaction because they didn\u2019t have that experience with someone who was angry. KMN: If we don\u2019t like how our emotions are affecting our lives, how do we simultaneously accept our emotions while also wanting to change ourselves? MB: Emotions come, as we say, unbidden. The experience of a feeling, it just happens. That\u2019s life. You watch a movie, you\u2019re in a conversation, someone says something hurtful, mean\u2014the feeling is the feeling. I think accepting that that\u2019s reality is a good thing to do. My feelings are my feelings, and they happen and it\u2019s OK. Then you have to make a decision. And this is the big one, which is: Is how I\u2019m feeling very strong and getting in the way? Am I feeling it for too long of a period of time and it\u2019s interfering with my success or my well-being or my decisions? The opportunities for shifting are generally around intensity and duration. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t accept it. Everybody gets permission to feel, as I say. There\u2019s no option there. For example, I\u2019ve had anxiety for 55 years. I used to have a very weird mindset around it, which was I have to find the doctor who\u2019s going to carve out the area of my brain that makes me anxious and then I\u2019ll never have anxiety again. That\u2019s not going to happen. Then a friend of mine interviewed me about my anxiety, and she goes, \u201cWhat are the things that you feel anxious about?\u201d And I shared all these different things. And she said, \u201cWhat do you notice that\u2019s in common about the things that make you feel anxious?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, actually it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s all the things that I care about.\u201d And she said, \u201cSo why would anxiety be bad for you? What if you just reframed it as the anxiety you have around the uncertainty of the outcome is really because you care about it?\u201d If you think about it through that lens, it doesn\u2019t mean you just ignore it, but you now apply a strategy with that mindset. It has radically changed my life because I don\u2019t think of it as a strategy to get rid of my anxiety; I see it as a strategy to work with my anxiety. We have been taught and almost made to believe that all unpleasant emotions or \u201cnegative\u201d emotions are bad for us or derail us from a goal, and I just think that\u2019s misguided. We just haven\u2019t been taught healthy strategies to deal with those emotions, and so we allow them to escalate\u2014so peeved becomes irritated, irritated becomes angry, angry becomes enraged; down becomes disappointment, disappointment becomes hopelessness, hopelessness becomes despair, despair becomes depression. If we were more emotionally self-aware when we\u2019re having little feelings, I think we would prevent a lot of the stronger, intense, unwanted emotions. KMN: How much are people in control of what they feel? MB: I think we are in much more control than we ever thought because our emotions are our responses to situations that happen in the world around us. Not everybody has the same reaction to the same stimulus. By way of example, if you\u2019re on a roller coaster ride, one of us is sitting there thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d The next one is like, \u201cThis is so freaking boring.\u201d It\u2019s the same roller coaster, but the difference is our appraisal of what the roller coaster means\u2014if I\u2019ve been on much bigger roller coasters in my life or if I got hurt on a roller coaster when I was a kid. All these are associations that are happening, that are learned over the course of our development. My hope is that people will just be aware of that. Just be aware that somehow across your development, you learned how to respond to emotions, you were taught somehow or another, whether implicitly or explicitly, that you should not talk about it or deny it or suppress it or it\u2019s OK to talk about it. It\u2019s important because it gives us a little bit more ownership over what we feel or how we feel and what we do with those feelings. Oftentimes, some people say, \u201cYou made me feel this way.\u201d And, yes, people say things that can be mean and they can activate feelings in us. But we have to make the choice to say, Well, thank you for your gross behavior, I\u2019m not owning that. I think the hard part is that we\u2019re not taught how to do that. KMN: So we can be creative with our emotion regulation strategies. MB: I think it\u2019s a creative process, actually. I play a game with myself. Sometimes when I\u2019m feeling activated by somebody, I\u2019ll remind myself, Marc, you\u2019re the director of the Center for Emotional Intelligence. You\u2019re like the Yoda of emotional intelligence. Be creative in your response to that. And it\u2019s fun, actually. I\u2019ll say something completely outside of the box, like \u201cThat was a really fascinating comment. I\u2019m curious where that came from.\u201d And the person\u2019s like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t expecting that from you. Say more about that.\u201d I love that process. And I think that it is an exercise in creativity. Greater Good wants to know: Do you think this article will influence your opinions or behavior?

      "content_text": "Today, Marc Brackett is the founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. But he remembers what it was like to be a kid who struggled with his emotions. \u201cI would sometimes just sit in a room and cry and catastrophize, like I\u2019m never going to figure this out,\u201d he recalls. He would think, \u201cI don\u2019t have anybody to talk to about it because I can\u2019t talk about it, because people are going to think I\u2019m weak.\u201d In his latest book, Dealing with Feeling , Brackett shares the emotion regulation skills that can help both kids and adults relate to themselves in a different way. He\u2019s an advocate of changing how we talk about emotions for happier lives and more flourishing societies. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month \u201cWe want to create a society where someone like me when I was a teenager has the opportunity to get it out and either have strategies for myself or have an emotional ally that can provide that support,\u201d he says. That\u2019s a far cry from where we are today, as Brackett discusses in our edited conversation below\u2014but he has ideas for how we can move forward. (This is the second part of a longer conversation\u2014you can read the first part here .) KMN: What do you think is the most damaging lesson that we learn about emotions? Marc Brackett, Ph.D. MB: I think the most damaging is becoming that self-saboteur\u2014the self-defeating talk, the self-criticism: I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m not strong enough. I\u2019m not smart enough. I\u2019m not this enough. It metastasizes and really inhibits us from achieving almost everything that we want in life. My argument is that negative self-talk starts very, very early, and it\u2019s usually because of being gaslighted. Other people start saying things like Oh you\u2019re ugly or You\u2019re too fat or You\u2019re too skinny or You\u2019re too tall, you\u2019re too short or You\u2019re too dark or You\u2019re too light or too masculine or You\u2019re too feminine . No one is there to help us sift through that barrage of negativity, and because of that we start believing how other people define our reality for us. I find that to be the most heart-wrenching aspect of society, that other people think it\u2019s their right to tell us who we are and how we should be. Then no one helps us have the agency to say, Hey, wait a minute. I\u2019m not buying into that narrative. Why do you think it\u2019s OK for you to talk that way to me or say these mean and hurtful things to me? This is why I feel adamant about making sure that children from preschool on are taught healthy emotion regulation. KMN: So the problem is being alone in those moments of having an unpleasant emotion, and not having someone to guide us through that? MB: Then you ruminate about it because society has also said you can\u2019t talk about this because That\u2019s baby stuff, that makes you weak. I\u2019ll never forget, I was visiting a kindergarten classroom and this kid was having a rough morning, and he didn\u2019t want to share it. Basically what he said was \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d That was a real wake-up call to me that this kid was going to be trapped with whatever he was feeling about being left out or not understanding something. How awful is it that a child was starting to believe that it was inappropriate to share whatever his experience was because of his fear of being judged. This message from society to suppress or repress or deny or ignore or boys don\u2019t cry is impacting very young children. KMN: If someone\u2019s reading your book and they want to start working on emotion regulation, what can they expect that process to look like? MB: I have to know what I\u2019m feeling, I have to know who I am as a person, and I have to know where I\u2019m going to be regulating, or the context. What I mean by that is the strategies that I might use to manage sadness might be very different than the strategies I use to maintain my happiness or cultivate a sense of calm and relaxation. In schools, we have a framework that supports kids in learning the full range of emotions, and then they explore the reasons for those emotions and the strategies for those emotions, and it spirals over the course of their development. For example, feeling lonely versus excluded versus being alienated. Those are three related but different concepts, and they\u2019re also intertwined with our social and cognitive development. Lonely is easier for a younger person to learn about. When you feel lonely, what can you do to feel less lonely? And then you have kids brainstorm, and they come up with ideas for that so everybody can hear about the ideas that come up. But what happens when you\u2019re excluded? It\u2019s a little harder, right? Because it wasn\u2019t your choice. You have to figure out how to navigate the social piece of that, and this is important. Same thing with feeling disappointed; if I\u2019m feeling disappointed, I can work harder. If it\u2019s a classroom thing, maybe I can study harder, I can get feedback, I can learn from my mistakes. But when you\u2019re feeling discouraged or hopeless, you need different strategies. Dealing with Feeling: Use Your Emotions to Create the Life You Want (Celadon Books, 2025, 320 pages) My vision for this is that it\u2019s a continuous development process. We learn little words and we start practicing those words, and then, as we develop, we learn more words, and we figure out strategies for those. Then we keep growing and growing and growing and practicing. Over time, we have this amazing tool bag of helpful strategies to regulate our feelings. The thing is that we can\u2019t predict the future. I lost my mom when I was only 23 years old. She died very suddenly of pancreatic cancer. It\u2019s hard to predict how you\u2019re going to feel and how you\u2019re going to deal with your feelings. The best I can offer is cultivating a muscle so that when those things happen, at least you know how to access those strategies. At least you know how to reach out to people to get the social support. Without cultivating those skills, your system goes into shock and you don\u2019t know how to think about the situation in a way that doesn\u2019t make you feel worse, and you don\u2019t really know how to talk to people about it. What happens is you isolate yourself more, or you revert to other strategies like drinking alcohol to numb yourself or doing drugs to escape, as opposed to having healthy strategies to manage the grief. KMN: One of the most poignant things for me in your book was when you wrote that some parents don\u2019t actually want to hear what their kids are feeling, because of how it makes them feel and because it means they would need to deal with it. MB: They\u2019re afraid because they haven\u2019t learned how to deal with their own emotions and feelings about their kids\u2019 feelings that they\u2019re afraid of, too. They\u2019re embarrassed that their daughter or son is feeling shame because they think it\u2019s their fault. So the alternative is what? Ignore it? No. The alternative is work on yourself and then be a supportive adult for your kid. KMN: How can we change the messages that children get from society about emotions? MB: We can teach emotion regulation to the people who have the greatest power so they can be the best possible role models for society. Government officials, CEOs of companies, superintendents of schools, parents in households, everyone. I say that with seriousness. This begins in childhood, but these are skills that we have to practice throughout life. I would go as far as to say that policymakers need to deeply understand the implications of their decisions on children\u2019s emotional development, because there are policies that can be created that will impact a child\u2019s healthy nervous system development. For example, bullying policies in schools, separating children from their parents: We know from decades of research the trauma that creates for children. If we were aware of the outcomes associated with bullying or separating kids from parents, maybe we would shift the policies that we created so as to not inflict harm on children. Oftentimes this is misperceived as indulgence of emotions. I\u2019m not talking about indulgence here, I\u2019m talking about scientific evidence for the impact of dysregulation. The outcomes for people who are ruminating, suppressing, denying emotion are not positive. Mental illness, anxiety, depression, substance misuse, the list goes on. The outcomes for people who are in relationships with others who are dysregulated are also not positive. It\u2019s our moral imperative to make sure that we are role models and that we are teaching these skills explicitly. KMN: How would you say the academic conversation about emotions has changed? Are there any new ideas that stand out to you? MB: I think my take on this is that the science is pretty good; the dissemination of these ideas has not been good. Essentially, our largest problem is implementation. For example, our education system has not committed to\u2014as a matter of fact, it is outright against, in many instances\u2014the teaching of these skills in schools. So where are you going to learn it? People say you learn it at home, but then the adults who are bringing children into this world have not had an emotion education either. So no one has actually had a formal education in this other than the experts. What we know from research is that when children are in schools that do the work and do it well, the outcomes are quite positive: more developed social skills, more developed emotional skills, better academic performance, the list goes on. KMN: Why else do you think the implementation hasn\u2019t been there? MB: I think another reason why is that society has changed. For example, social media is a factor because we think we\u2019re going to get the quick fix from watching the 30-second Instagram video of some influencer telling us to throw our anxiety out the door. And then we realize that you really can\u2019t just throw your anxiety out the door. I think we have become addicted to like next, next, next, next, and in that addiction, we don\u2019t realize that we\u2019re never actually dealing with the problem or the feeling. Whether it\u2019s the Instagram post on reducing anxiety, whether it\u2019s doing a cold plunge, whether it\u2019s this affirmation that somebody says is the thing that made their life different, there are endless amounts of things being thrown at people. But there\u2019s not a lot of time in terms of learning a skill, practicing a skill, and refining the skill. I always make the parallel to poetry, like Amanda Gorman. You don\u2019t become an incredible poet by writing one poem. You become an incredible poet by writing thousands of poems and getting feedback and growing. Well, you can\u2019t become an emotionally regulated person without learning lots of strategies, practicing those strategies, and refining them over the course of time.

      "content_text": "It\u2019s back-to-school season, and if you have a teen or even know one, they\u2019re probably feeling a little anxious. New class schedule, new classmates, new expectations. These days, when anxious teens turn to us as parents, teachers, and coaches for help, we might encourage \u201cmindfulness,\u201d or paying attention to the present moment with openness and without judgment. But the truth is, developmentally, this\u00a0inner development\u00a0method might not always be the healthiest approach. While mindfulness advice is well-intentioned, it\u2019s also often misapplied, and it cannot exist on its own. At this phase, teens\u2019 anxiety often centers around their fragile, emerging relationships, which, in turn, give meaning to the self. That\u2019s why mindfulness, which too often focuses exclusively on the self, tends to miss the relationship work teens so desperately need. It\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not enough. Our own research suggests that taking a compassion-based approach during the transition to early adolescence has real benefits. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month SEE Learning is a comprehensive, compassion-based educational framework developed at Emory University that integrates social-emotional learning with ethical discernment, resilience, and systems thinking. It equips students and educators with tools to cultivate awareness, empathy, and responsible action for personal and collective well-being In our study of over 600 students between the ages of nine and 11, those who participated in SEE Learning showed measurable gains in\u00a0perspective taking,\u00a0empathic concern,\u00a0self-compassion, and\u00a0intrinsic prosocial motivation to help others. They also reported stronger academic goal setting and a greater sense of classroom support. Ideally, mindfulness would be combined with compassion training that helps teens learn to nurture and protect their ties to one another. Why mindfulness doesn\u2019t (always) work When we tell teens to \u201cjust breathe\u201d in the face of relational pain, it can feel dismissive. Perhaps worse, doing so can make them feel even more alone. And when mindfulness is delivered as a sit-and-be-quiet tool to reduce stress, it loses its power to heal. While evidence has demonstrated the promise of mindfulness in teens, it\u2019s not always taught in a developmentally appropriate way, especially for adolescents. A 2024 analysis by Brian Galla and his colleagues found that, in general, universal school-based mindfulness programs had no lasting benefits for adolescents. Why? It may be because these programs often bypass what teens are actually working on: identity development, social connection, and meaning making. Mindfulness, when stripped of its context, can feel like a solitary act. We aren\u2019t calling for a rejection of mindfulness altogether. In fact, teens have told our research team that they\u2019re curious to learn more about mindfulness, but they want more than strategies for individual coping. They\u2019re not just asking to feel calm, they\u2019re asking to feel seen. They want to understand themselves, their relationships, and their place in the world. Therefore, we need to invest in practices that build relationships, foster belonging, and meet teens where they are. What mindfulness misses Beneath the surface-level jitters of back-to-school season lies a deeper, more vulnerable fear for teens: Do people see me? In other words, underneath \u201cWill math be too hard?\u201d might be: \u201cWill people notice me?\u201d Among crowded classrooms and social media feeds, teens want to know that their presence means something and that they are not replaceable or irrelevant. \u201cAm I good enough, or do I have to change to fit in?\u201d Teens are constantly navigating other people\u2019s expectations, whether they be around academic standing, social status, or even personal identity. \u201cDo you actually like me, or are you just tolerating me?\u201d Teens are hyper-aware of social cues, especially ones that feel challenging to their sense of authenticity and belonging. These questions aren\u2019t new. Developmental scientists have been exploring the roots of these human fears and longings for decades. Writers like Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou have long understood that how we are seen, cared for, and valued by others shapes our sense of self. And from our own vantage point as teachers and scientists who have teens in our lives whom we love, we know these questions are not abstract. They are real experiences that show up in classrooms, at dinner tables, and in quiet moments of self-doubt. We can help on a deeper, relational level. That\u2019s where compassion training comes in. Meeting teens where they are Young people are wired for relationships, and emerging research shows that adolescents thrive when given concrete, relationship-oriented strategies to navigate their complex social worlds. In this context,\u00a0compassion becomes an essential area of study and practice\u2014not just a virtue, but a skill that can be cultivated. Compassion, here, means empathy plus action.\u00a0It goes beyond simply noticing or calming; it involves recognizing suffering, whether in oneself or others, and responding with thoughtful, discerning action to help. This makes compassion distinct from mindfulness, which emphasizes present-moment awareness without necessarily prompting a response. Compassion, by contrast, is awareness in action. It\u2019s a dynamic, context-sensitive process that adolescents can learn, practice, and embody in their daily lives. With guidance and support, teens can develop compassionate habits that strengthen their relationships, emotional resilience, and sense of purpose. Compassion enters a child\u2019s life through many channels, family bonds, friendships, cultural traditions, and spiritual teachings. It\u2019s not confined to the classroom; it\u2019s part of what makes us human. And while compassion may arise naturally, research increasingly finds it can also be cultivated in ways that strengthen resilience and enhance life quality. For adolescents, who are navigating identity, belonging, and emotional complexity, harnessing this human capacity may be especially powerful. Compassion-based practices can be used by teachers and parents to help answer the developmental questions of belonging that teens are inherently asking. And as one of us (Blake Colaianne) demonstrated in a 2025 study , compassion practices can be taught to teens in ways that feel accessible, relevant, and meaningful. Key Takeaways Mindfulness isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all: Many mindfulness practices feel forced or superficial to teens. When used as behavior management (\u201csit still and be quiet\u201d), they can backfire. Teens need developmentally tuned support: Adolescents are figuring out who they are and where they belong. Generic mindfulness doesn\u2019t always meet their emotional or social needs. Compassion works better: Compassion-based practices are grounded in science and help teens feel seen, valued, and connected, exactly what they\u2019re looking for. What adults can do: Explore programs like SEE Learning. Support practices that build relationships, not just regulation. If we want to support teens\u2019 mental health and resilience, we need to move beyond mindfulness as a standalone solution and, instead, reframe it through a compassion-based, relational lens. When we intertwine mindfulness and compassion, we shift away from simply telling teens to \u201cpause and breathe\u201d to manage stress and, instead, acknowledge the human needs that evoked the stress to begin with. In fact, if we start with \u201cI see you, and what you say matters,\u201d we might find that pausing and breathing becomes even easier. The fundamental difference is that mindfulness can protect and nurture the self, but what teens need are strategies to protect and nurture their social ties, the relationships that give them meaning. School-based programs like SEE Learning are showing what\u2019s possible in compassion education. As a research leader in social-emotional and ethical learning, I\u2019ve helped guide SEE Learning research across multiple countries, including high-conflict contexts like Ukraine. In my 2025 study, we found that compassion-centered approaches improved empathy, motivation, and classroom climate among elementary students. And in a separate qualitative study in Ukraine , teachers described SEE Learning as essential for helping students process trauma and build emotional resilience during wartime. These findings underscore the global relevance of compassion-based education, not just as a curriculum, but as a humanizing force in schools. What you can do As compassion scientists, we\u2019ve found that there are evidence-based tools that can support teens in ways that standalone mindfulness cannot. These tools help teens feel seen, valued, and connected\u2026because, developmentally, that\u2019s what they need most. While you may not be able to put your teen (or students) through a formal compassion training program, there are certain principles that can be adapted to any setting, at home or school. Secure the base: Discuss with your teen, \u201cWho is rooting for you?\u201d or \u201cWho or what reminds you of who you are?\u201d Help them build a photo album or playlist on their phone that can remind them of their worth and what they are capable of. Practice ethical reflection: Use real-life scenarios and structured dialogue to help teens explore multiple perspectives and build the confidence to do what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s hard. While we work to \u201csee\u201d teens, we can also help them \u201csee\u201d each other. Co-create: View teens as experts in what teens are currently going through. Enlist their help to design compassion tools for younger students in school. (Research shows that this not only helps others but also deepens their own empathy.) Let them lead: Support teens in designing and leading projects that apply care and compassion to life outside of school, such as real-world challenges in their communities. Center project-based learning around the ethics of care. As we prepare for the back-to-school season, let\u2019s carry forward this wisdom: Our presence and our care are the things that shape a teen\u2019s sense of self and help them feel safe enough to take risks and grow.

The resilience animals\u2014a dolphin, a dog, a bunny, a giraffe, and a sun\u2014come from the Mindfulness and Self-Compassion Workbook for Kids , which I wrote with the help of 12 children. They are also part of the research-based Mindfulness and Self-Compassion for Children and Caregivers course and related teacher training programs I have created. The workbooks and programs are designed to teach kids (and caregivers) the essential skills of mindfulness and self-compassion. Mindfulness invites us to be present with our thoughts, feelings, and surroundings in a curious, non-judgmental way. And self-compassion means we treat ourselves like a good friend when we are struggling. When kids learn to notice their feelings and respond with care, they can more easily handle life\u2019s challenges and bounce back when life gets hard. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month It\u2019s delightful to witness how these animals make learning mindfulness and self-compassion fun for both kids and their caregivers. (You can take the quiz yourself and discover your resilience animal !) Resilience habits take root in classrooms when teachers embrace them, and they take root in families when parents embrace them . Here are the five resilience habits and how you can work with children on them. \u201cSpotting\u201d our feelings, thoughts, and sensations \u201cWhen I get stressed, I like to use mindfulness (Spots) like noticing my senses or how I feel.\u201d \u2014Ambika, age 12 Resilience begins with awareness, which is why the first resilience habit animal is Spots the giraffe. The giraffe\u2019s spots can remind us to \u201cspot\u201d what is happening inside and around us, including our thoughts, feelings, body sensations, and five senses. We can also be mindful of our urges and actions. One way to help children grow mindfulness is through modeling. We can mindfully name our feelings and draw attention to what we notice through our own senses. We can also scaffold children\u2019s mindful awareness by asking them how they feel and helping them be curious about what they can see, hear, and sense. For example, a parent waiting in a long line at a store could say to a child, \u201cI noticed I\u2019m feeling a little impatient and my shoulders are getting tight. How are you feeling?\u201d The two might then decide to name things that they can see and hear, or play a mindful seeing game like Eye Spy together. \u201cSpotting\u201d our thoughts, feelings, and five senses can help us stay present and balanced when difficult things happen. Research on mindfulness suggests that it can also be a catalyst for cultivating healthy habits. Belonging to humanity \u201cWhen I\u2019m stressed, I use Buddy. I remember that I\u2019m not alone and most people go through the same things.\u201d \u2014Kamille, age 11 The second resilience habit is remembering that difficult moments are part of the human experience. In the field of self-compassion, this habit is referred to as common humanity . When we practice common humanity, we remember that it is natural to sometimes struggle and falter, and we feel connected in our shared humanity. Common humanity contrasts with the resilience-depleting habit of telling ourselves that we \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d be struggling. Whereas self-judgment tends to make us feel worse, remembering the universality of challenges boosts our ability to cope. Buddy the dog is the resilience animal that reminds us it\u2019s OK to be fully human and feel as we do. Just as a dog can be \u201cman\u2019s best friend,\u201d so too can Buddy help us to remember that we are not alone. In a not-yet-published study of the Mindfulness and Self-Compassion for Children and Caregivers program, many children share that they use the \u201cBuddy habit\u201d to soothe themselves when they struggle. Parents can help kids to internalize a sense of belonging by appropriately sharing their own struggles, as well as highlighting the shared experience of challenges in daily life. Self-kindness\u2014gentle and strong \u201cI feel like I have the Snuggles habit. When something goes wrong, I start thinking \u2018It\u2019s OK; I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019\u201d \u2014Denny, age 10 Self-kindness is a superpower, and perhaps that\u2019s why Snuggles the bunny frequently dons a cape. Kindness can be tender and comfort us when things go wrong, and kindness can also take the form of Super Snuggles, encouraging us to reach for our dreams and rise to challenges. Self-kindness is the third component of self-compassion as defined by researcher Kristin Neff . Wrapping ourselves in a blanket of kindness as we go through challenges boosts our resilience and positive coping skills . Happily, self-compassion is a trainable skill. A simple self-compassion practice is to ask ourselves during a moment of struggle how we would respond to a close friend with a similar challenge . We can then turn that kindness back to ourselves. There are many strategies for helping children grow self-kindness , including speaking to them in a compassionate voice that they can internalize. There are also Mindful Self-Compassion programs for adults , teens , and children . Taking kind actions \u201cI like to use the Doodles habit\u2014I go for a run or I journal.\u201d \u2014Maya, age 14 Mindfulness and Self-Compassion Workbook for Kids, Volume 1: 40+ Fun Activities and Comics to Learn to Self-Regulate, Find Peace, and Be Kind to Yourself (Wholly Mindful) Self-compassion can also take the form of kind actions. When things go wrong, Doodles the Dolphin asks us what we can do to support our own well-being. This sometimes involves turning toward our problems and actively trying to resolve them. Other times, kind actions might involve shifting our attention away from our problems, and focusing on a good book, the natural world, or spending time with a friend. Helpful actions will look different for different people. Here are some favorites from kids who helped me create my workbooks: When stressed, Khalil likes to rest or move his body. Sofia finds comfort caring for her plants. Matteo feels better when he makes art or plays games, and Anjali calms herself with music. You can invite children to make a list of activities that are kind to their mind, body, and heart, and they can look back at their lists when they are struggling. The litmus test for determining whether or not an action is kind is to ask ourselves if it will benefit us both now and later. Often the choice is not whether or not to feel discomfort, but rather what to do while we wait for the pain to pass. Taking in the good \u201cWhen I\u2019m upset, I like the Sunny habit. I think about something different and just play songs that make me happy. Sunny thinks about the good things.\u201d \u2014Nayeliz, age 10 When things go wrong, sometimes we just need to compassionately be with the pain. But over time, we also want to notice good things. When I work with kids in schools on cloudy days, I sometimes invite them to look out the window and ask them, \u201cIs there sun?\u201d I receive a chorus of mixed responses, and then I remind them that the sun is there; it\u2019s just hidden behind the clouds. There are always good things happening, even when life gets hard, which is why our last resilience habit is called Sunny the sun. Our brains have a natural negativity bias, so we need to be intentional about helping our minds take in goodness . We can pause when we have an enjoyable moment throughout the day and take a few deep breaths as we bring our attention to our senses. This can help good things be more salient in our mind. We can also purposefully remember a handful of good things each day . What would be helpful? Which of the five resilience animals is your best match ? Do you like to observe the situation like Spots the giraffe, or remind yourself you\u2019re not alone like Buddy the dog? Is kindness your superpower like Snuggles the bunny, or do you take action like Doodles the dolphin? Or maybe you look for the good like Sunny? The five resilience animal habits create a robust toolkit for coping with difficult things, and we can be intentional about building these skills. When it comes to learning the habits, the key is to grow them when all is well so that they are accessible when things go wrong. If I were going to add a sixth habit, it would be remembering to ask ourselves what we need during our moments of struggle. This comic from volume 2 of the Mindfulness and Self-Compassion Workbook for Kids highlights the power of asking ourselves what we need when things go wrong: When I\u2019m stressed, I\u2019m sometimes tempted to pick up my phone and scroll. But then I remember the resilience animals and ask myself: What would actually be helpful? During moments of struggle, we can turn to the five choices from the Resilience Animal Quiz . Do we need mindful awareness like Spots? Or a Buddy-style sense of connection? Perhaps we need kindness like Snuggles, or to take helpful action like Doodles. Or maybe we need Sunny to help us remember that good things are happening, too. One, two, or a collection of all the resilience animal habits might be helpful in the moment. The key is to pause during our moments of struggle and ask ourselves what we truly need. Greater Good wants to know: Do you think this article will influence your opinions or behavior?

      "content_text": "Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night with upsetting thoughts spinning through your head? Maybe you argued with your partner and you\u2019re reliving the fight in agonizing detail. Perhaps you can\u2019t stop worrying about all the things that could go wrong in an upcoming job interview. Or maybe you\u2019re perseverating about the state of the world. Rehashing the past or imagining the future isn\u2019t unusual. That\u2019s how we humans figure out how to navigate our lives. But sometimes this system goes haywire, and we get stuck, like a needle stuck on a record album that plays the same riff over and over again. Repetitive, ruminative thinking can make it hard to see reality as it is, keeping us locked into negative thinking patterns that don\u2019t serve us. When that happens, our mental health may be compromised; we may lose sleep, have trouble concentrating, or feel lethargic and depressed. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month What can we do instead? There are many tips for transforming rumination into something less toxic and even useful. Here are a few tools I\u2019ve found helpful in my own life\u2014and that research suggests can work for those of us prone to rumination. Practice mindful awareness Creating a little separation from your spinning thoughts can help transform them into something more manageable. By becoming an observer of your present experience using mindfulness techniques, you can learn to let go a bit of the past and future (where thoughts reign supreme) and stay more grounded in the moment, accepting \u201cwhat is.\u201d Practicing mindfulness has the added benefit of revealing the transient nature of your thoughts, helping to defang them somewhat and make it easier to let them go. There are many mindfulness practices that might help with this. For example, a simple breath meditation , where you practice focusing on your breath and paying gentle, accepting attention to its changing patterns, may do the trick. Thoughts can (and likely will) still come into your head as you practice this. But they can be named gently before returning your focus to your breath, giving them less power . Trying out a mindful body scan may also reduce intrusive thoughts. By focusing on sensations in your body\u2014tension or pain, differences in temperature, points of contact with the ground, etc.\u2014you can bring yourself into the present in a way that will make thoughts of the past or the future less salient, allowing them to drift away . I definitely find that using mindfulness can make tricky, persistent thoughts less problematic. Plus, I get the added bonus of feeling calmer and less stressed\u2014a win-win. Gain some perspective Sometimes our thoughts are persistent because there is something we need to learn from them before we can let them go. Taking the time to examine our intrusive thoughts and gain perspective on them may help shift them from troubling and distracting to something more useful. Self-compassion\u2014a combination of mindfully becoming aware of your thoughts, offering yourself words of kindness, and acknowledging that you aren\u2019t alone in your suffering\u2014may help. By not pushing away your thoughts, but accepting them with a compassionate attitude, you may be able to examine them with more openness, perhaps reframing what\u2019s bothering you in a new way and considering steps you can take to improve things. Research finds that having a self-compassionate mindset is tied to less rumination, even in patients with major depression (where rumination is often severe). However, people without depression can also benefit. In one study , young adults who wrote about a negative experience in a self-compassionate way ruminated less afterward than those instructed to write in an emotionally expressive way. You can also gain perspective through what researchers call \u201c self-distancing \u201d\u2014considering your internal state as if you were someone looking in from the outside. One clever way to do this is to write about your experience in the third person, using pronouns like \u201cyou\u201d \u201che,\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d instead of \u201cI\u201d\u2014a technique that has been found to reduce rumination . Gaining Perspective on Negative Events Take a step back and analyze your feelings without ruminating Try It Now How might this look in real life? Let\u2019s say my friend tells me she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me right now, and I\u2019m agonizing about the end of our friendship. I can talk to myself (or write out an imaginary dialogue) like this: Jill, what your friend said hurt your feelings, but it doesn\u2019t mean your friendship is over. Think of the many times you yourself had to withdraw or didn\u2019t have the energy to engage because you were tired, stressed, or depressed. You need to give her some space and not assume the worst. Looking at my thoughts in this light makes everything seem less dire and helps loosen sticky perseverating. Move\u2014preferably outside Rumination, by definition, means getting lost in your thoughts to the point where you feel stuck or immobile. Sometimes what you really need is to take yourself out of your head and into your body in a way that can break the rumination cycle. Getting some exercise might do the trick. Hundreds of studies show how physical exercise, in general, can be helpful for reducing rumination\u2014one of the key features of a depressed mind. Even engaging in a single session of moderate exercise has been found to reduce rumination (among other symptoms) in depressed patients. But being outside in nature may help above and beyond physical exercise. As another study found, walking in the woods reduced rumination more than walking along a road for the same amount of time. If you go out walking, it may help to keep your attention on your surroundings and prevent troubling thoughts from cropping up\u2014perhaps by doing an awe walk , enjoying the company of a friend, or taking pictures along the way\u2014giving your overactive mind a much-needed break. This is my personal go-to activity for ruminative thinking, and it never ceases to surprise me how a good walk in the woods puts everything in a better light. Stop feeding the fire and redirect your attention Sometimes, we get lost in repetitive thoughts because we keep getting re-stimulated by listening to the same stories over and over again. If we are ruminating over things beyond our control\u2014like wars abroad, presidential elections, or climate change\u2014we may need to take a break from our 24/7 (bad) news cycle and let our minds focus on other, better things. Too much negative news consumption does no one any good; it blinds us to the good things going on in life, giving us a skewed view of the world and making us feel helpless. While we shouldn\u2019t put our heads in the sand, either, we need to balance our over-attention to negative stories with a deliberate focus on what\u2019s going right. That may include taking a break from social media or TV news, practicing gratitude for the good in our lives, or taking action with like-minded people on an issue of concern to us. These can help reduce the fuel for our worried minds, while pointing us in a healthier direction. Likewise, if we\u2019re ruminating about other people in our lives\u2014perhaps an ex-boyfriend\u2014we may want to disengage from news of them for a while. If we can\u2019t stop replaying negative interactions with loved ones in our minds, we may want to recall past positive interactions or assertively communicate our needs to them, rather than letting our minds spin. Too often, our relationship ruminations create a toxic brew that keeps us stuck. That does no one any good. Talk to a trusted person\u2014or maybe a therapist It\u2019s always a gift when someone knows you well enough that they can listen and help you get unstuck. Whether they do it with humor or by offering sage wisdom, sometimes getting an outsider\u2019s perspective and not sitting alone with your thoughts can move you into a better headspace. However, there\u2019s a difference between someone who can cheer you up momentarily and someone who can have a more lasting impact on your ruminating tendencies. If your trusted friend distracts you by making you laugh, great; it may offer you some relief, and that\u2019s good. But that may not solve your overall problem, and rumination may return. Likewise, if someone supports you by sharing your repetitive thoughts\u2014maybe even egging you on, without offering insight or advice for getting unstuck\u2014this probably won\u2019t be helpful, either (and may even make things worse ). So, you should tread carefully to find the right person who can listen well and offer empathy, but also provide a helpful perspective. I\u2019m lucky to have friends like that who\u2019ve helped \u201cunstick\u201d me at times. If you don\u2019t have people like that in your life or want someone more emotionally neutral, seeing a therapist might be your best option\u2014and, in some cases, probably necessary. If intrusive thoughts are so problematic that they\u2019re hurting your health, relationships, or ability to engage with life, it may be a sign of a more serious condition, like anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or even post-traumatic stress disorder. In that case, you\u2019ll want a professional, like a therapist who can provide guidance for letting go of troubling thoughts and moving into healthier thinking patterns. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for example, has a proven track record for helping people with rumination and is the go-to therapy for those suffering from many mental health disorders. Of course, we can\u2019t simply push away all troubling thoughts all the time, nor should we. Persistent thoughts can be signals to ourselves about underlying life issues that need resolution. But by drawing upon mindfulness, a self-distanced perspective, physical exercise, redirection, and social support, you can perhaps find a path forward. While there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach, these tools may help\u2014and, at the very least, they are unlikely to do harm. Plus, who knows? You might even get yourself that good night\u2019s sleep you\u2019ve been missing. Greater Good wants to know: Do you think this article will influence your opinions or behavior?

      "content_text": "Since mindfulness is something you can practice at home for free, it often sounds like the perfect tonic for stress and mental health issues. Mindfulness is a type of Buddhist-based meditation in which you focus on being aware of what you\u2019re sensing, thinking, and feeling in the present moment. The first recorded evidence for this, found in India, is over 1,500 years old. The Dharmatr\u0101ta Meditation Scripture, written by a community of Buddhists, describes various practices and includes reports of symptoms of depression and anxiety that can occur after meditation. It also details cognitive anomalies associated with episodes of psychosis, dissociation, and depersonalization (when people feel the world is \u201cunreal\u201d). In the past eight years, there has been a surge of scientific research in this area. These studies show that adverse effects are not rare. A 2022 study ,using a sample of 953 people in the U.S. who meditated regularly, showed that over 10% of participants experienced adverse effects which had a significant negative impact on their everyday life. For 1% of participants, this negative impact lasted for at least one month. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month According to a review of over 40 years of research that was published in 2020, the most common adverse effects are anxiety and depression. These are followed by psychotic or delusional symptoms, dissociation or depersonalization, and fear or terror. Research also found that adverse effects can happen to people without previous mental health problems, to those who have only had a moderate exposure to meditation, and they can lead to long-lasting symptoms . The Western world has also had evidence about these adverse effects for a long time. In 1976, Arnold Lazarus, a key figure in the cognitive-behavioral science movement, said that meditation, when used indiscriminately, could induce \u201cserious psychiatric problems such as depression, agitation, and even schizophrenic decompensation.\u201d There is evidence that mindfulness can benefit people\u2019s well-being. The problem is that mindfulness coaches, videos, apps, and books rarely warn people about the potential adverse effects. Professor of management and ordained Buddhist teacher Ronald Purser wrote in his 2023 book McMindfulness that mindfulness has become a kind of \u201ccapitalist spirituality.\u201d In the U.S. alone, meditation is worth $2.2 billion (\u00a31.7 billion). And the senior figures in the mindfulness industry should be aware of the problems with meditation. Jon Kabat-Zinn , a key figure behind the mindfulness movement, admitted in a 2017 interview with the Guardian that \u201c90% of the research [into the positive impacts] is subpar.\u201d In his foreword to the 2015 U.K. Mindfulness All-Party Parliamentary Report, Kabat-Zinn suggests that mindfulness meditation can eventually transform \u201cwho we are as human beings and individual citizens, as communities and societies, as nations, and as a species.\u201d This religious-like enthusiasm for the power of mindfulness to change not only individual people but the course of humanity is common among advocates. Even many atheists and agnostics who practice mindfulness believe that this practice has the power to increase peace and compassion in the world. Media discussion of mindfulness has also been somewhat imbalanced. In 2015, my book with clinical psychologist Catherine Wikholm, Buddha Pill , included a chapter summarizing the research on meditation\u2019s adverse effects. It was widely disseminated by the media, including a New Scientist article, and a BBC Radio 4 documentary . But there was little media coverage in 2022 of the most expensive study in the history of meditation science (over $8 million funded by research charity the Wellcome Trust). The study tested more than 8,000 children (aged 11\u201314) across 84 schools in the U.K. from 2016 to 2018. Its results showed that mindfulness failed to improve the mental well-being of children compared to a control group, and may even have had detrimental effects on those who were at risk of mental health problems. Ethical implications Is it ethical to sell mindfulness apps, teach people meditation classes, or even use mindfulness in clinical practice without mentioning its adverse effects? Given the evidence of how varied and common these effects are, the answer should be no. However, many meditation and mindfulness instructors believe that these practices can only do good and don\u2019t know about the potential for adverse effects. The most common account I hear from people who have suffered adverse meditation effects is that the teachers don\u2019t believe them. They\u2019re usually told to just keep meditating and it will go away. Research about how to safely practice meditation has only recently begun, which means there isn\u2019t yet clear advice to give people. There is a wider problem in that meditation deals with unusual states of consciousness, and we don\u2019t have psychological theories of mind to help us understand these states. But there are resources people can use to learn about these adverse effects. These include websites produced by meditators who experienced serious adverse effects and academic handbooks with dedicated sections to this topic. In the U.S., there is a clinical service dedicated to people who have experienced acute and long-term problems, led by a mindfulness researcher. For now, if meditation is to be used as a well-being or therapeutic tool, the public needs to be informed about its potential for harm.

      "content_text": "Have you ever had thoughts like these in your relationship? When your partner comes home late, you think, They\u2019re neglecting me. Work is more important than I am . If your partner doesn\u2019t initiate lovemaking, you think, We\u2019re on our way to a sexless marriage. I knew this would happen . If your partner is distracted at the dinner table, you think, They\u2019re bored. They have nothing to say to me. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s come to this . If they forget to ask a follow-up question after a doctor\u2019s visit, you think, They\u2019re selfish and insensitive. I\u2019m alone in this relationship . Thoughts like these can arise when you feel threatened in your relationship, and then similar thoughts may follow. Reflexive, negative thoughts fueled by anxiety multiply. They may even become thought-pinwheels, spinning into what psychologists call rumination . Your ruminative thoughts distort your perceptions of your mate. Over time, as the distortions build into stories about the other person, you stop opening up, relating directly, and sharing yourself. You lose touch with the adventure of love. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month In my therapy practice, I\u2019ve seen overthinking erode love between people whenever it operates unseen and unchallenged. My vantage point isn\u2019t solely professional either. As a former chronic ruminator, I\u2019ve suffered the destructive effects of overthinking firsthand, including a painful divorce in my late 20s. Now, over two decades later, I know differently. Happy love stories are created, not stumbled upon. Not only have I lived the changes that come with undoing rumination in the relationship my husband and I have developed over the last 17 years, but I\u2019ve also helped hundreds of couples foster deeper intimacy and safer, more fulfilling connections by doing this work. My new book Stop Overthinking Your Relationship shares these strategies to help couples nurture love, trust, and satisfaction. Five kinds of relationship rumination In romantic relationships, overthinking gradually\u2014day after day, month after month\u2014can turn into a bad cognitive habit. It shortens our bandwidth for awareness, empathy, curiosity, and whatever is happening in our own hearts. Like a snowball rolling downhill and gathering momentum, ruminative thoughts turn in a seemingly endless loop around the same painful themes. I\u2019ve identified five distinct rumination cycles based on my work with clients: Blame. This is my fault. I\u2019m such an idiot. How could I let this happen? It\u2019s unacceptable, intolerable, horrible, awful. My partner is selfish. They\u2019re wrong. They should pay for this. They should apologize. Don\u2019t they realize how much pain they\u2019re causing me? The blame cycle revolves around painful past events. You\u2019re sure you\u2019ve been unfairly treated, taken advantage of, and misunderstood. You had good intentions, and your partner misinterpreted what you said or did. You planned a special trip, and your partner ruined it with their irritability. You recall the past selectively. Events confirming your own (or your partner\u2019s) flaws are magnified. This essay is adapted from Stop Overthinking Your Relationship: Break the Cycle of Anxious Rumination to Nurture Love, Trust, and Connection with Your Partner (New Harbinger Publications, 2022, 200 pages). Control. I know best. I\u2019m rational. I\u2019m in touch with my emotions. My views should hold sway. I\u2019m more genuine. I\u2019m kinder, wiser, healthier, superior, younger, older. Because I\u2019m the extravert, I\u2019m more suited to organize our social life. I\u2019m the one who keeps us healthy, safe, and happy. I\u2019m the one who knows how to handle this. Control thoughts orbit a desired future outcome and the best way to achieve it. Your partner must sit down at the table immediately. They must talk to someone\u2014a therapist, parent, boss, or realtor\u2014ASAP. It\u2019s time for an emergency meeting with your attorney because you know what the next step is. You\u2019re curious about consensual nonmonogamy, and so they should be, too. It\u2019s time to go to Hawaii. You\u2019re done with long-distance relationships. Tension, mistrust, and inflexibility accompany the control cycle. Thoughts have a moralistic edge. You believe in externally defined truths\u2014and you\u2019re the one who knows what they are. Your partner should and must fulfill your vision of the relationship. Possibilities and options are black-and-white. There\u2019s good or bad, right or wrong, healthy or unhealthy. Doubt. Can I be sure of my own perceptions? Maybe I\u2019m imagining things. Did what I think took place really happen? Why is every other couple doing better than we are? Why did I choose my partner? Is there someone smarter, kinder, more attractive, or richer out there for me? Why did my partner choose me? Am I a fraud? Can I trust my own choices? My intuition has misled me in the past. What if I keep making poor choices? In this cycle, there\u2019s never enough certainty. There are never absolute guarantees. No evidence is ever ironclad enough to support your choices, decisions, or actions. Good times seem insubstantial and fleeting. Searching for evidence only reinforces doubts. Painful insecurity and self-judgment are the hallmarks of chronic doubt cycles. The more you overthink, the less you trust your own recollections and intuition. Worry. What will happen if he gets hurt on the job? What if we divorce and I don\u2019t see our children as much as I do now? What if they stop loving me? She might cancel our next date if she finds out I\u2019m a type-1 diabetic. One of us might catch COVID and give it to my father. This could be the last time we\u2019re happy together as a couple. In this cycle, worst-case scenarios rule. Fear keeps this cycle going. You convince yourself you\u2019ll be safe as long as you prepare for the worst. Your mind does this by thinking of everything that could go wrong. Self-pity. Self-pity cycles are focused on oneself as a victim. Why me? There\u2019s nothing I can do. Life is unfair. I don\u2019t deserve this. How come bad things always happen to me? I\u2019ve tried everything. My situation is hopeless. We don\u2019t stand a chance as a couple. Nothing makes a difference. The universe is against me. There\u2019s no solution. Nothing will ever change. Often, the unacknowledged expectation is that by embracing the role of a victim, you\u2019ll inspire your partner to rescue you. But when you make your partner responsible for your well-being or behave as though you\u2019re completely helpless when you\u2019re not, they end up feeling controlled. All of us are capable of spinning all the rumination cycles, and it\u2019s not unusual to spin a hybrid of two or even three of them at once. But most of us have a dominant cycle: the one we spin most often. We may spin it so much that it colors our identity and personality. You probably have a secondary cycle, too, that you spin when your dominant cycle fails to bring resolution, relief, or closure. How to break the rumination cycle While your thoughts may feel like truth, your rumination sometimes operates as a defense: a coping strategy used to distract you from your own vulnerability. Let\u2019s say your girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to a text you sent her six hours ago. You\u2019re upset, and you think, What\u2019s she doing? Has she forgotten about me? Is she ghosting me on purpose? I thought she enjoyed our weekend as much as I did. Is she already tired of me? As you talk to a friend, you focus on all the ways she has disappointed you. But what if underneath the rumination, something else is going on: You miss her? Your overthinking about your girlfriend is a protection against heartache and longing, uncomfortable emotions you\u2019d prefer not to feel. To counter rumination, what you need to do\u2014what we all need to do\u2014is to pivot from thinking about moments that unsettle you to being with them. This isn\u2019t something most of us have been explicitly taught how to do. When an event takes you off guard and you feel something emotionally or physically unnerving, do you consciously spend time being with your inner experience? If your answer is no, then you\u2019re a normal 21st-century human. Most people\u2019s first instinct is to try to get rid of unsettling experiences. Being with yourself and your partner is a radical act. The following four steps can help guide you along the way. 1. See thoughts to become aware of rumination. Pause. Stop what you\u2019re doing for one minute. Direct your attention inward or relax into a full-bodied experience of awareness. Notice whatever mental or cognitive activity is taking place within you in the here and now. Inquire. Ask, \u201cIs what\u2019s happening in my mind a thought (or a series of thoughts)?\u201d Tune in. Is the answer to this question \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d or \u201cno\u201d? (If it\u2019s \u201cno,\u201d you\u2019re probably focused, in the flow of the task, or at peace. If it\u2019s \u201cmaybe,\u201d go through these steps again until you receive a clear answer.) If your partner cancels dinner and your mind spins with thoughts like, They\u2019re trying to hurt me intentionally. I can\u2019t trust them. Why would they do this to me? I\u2019ll show them by going out alone tonight , seeing these thoughts as thoughts interrupts the momentum of your blame cycle. You don\u2019t automatically believe your thoughts are accurate representations of reality simply because you\u2019re upset. 2. Label the mental habit or pattern. Once you see that you\u2019re having a thought, label it by noting several aspects: The thought itself. If you realize you were anxiously envisioning yourself and your girlfriend bored and miserable 20 years from now in the same small apartment you live in now, the following words might capture these thoughts: My girlfriend won\u2019t ever travel with me and explore new places. Life is passing us by. We\u2019ll end up old and unsatisfied . Is it a fact or pseudofact\u2014an opinion, judgment, assumption, or expectation you mistake as truth? Much of our rumination includes pseudeofacts that aren\u2019t necessarily true. The rumination cycle that your thought reflects\u2014is it blame, worry, doubt, control, self-pity, or some combination? The trigger. A trigger can be an action your partner takes\u2014or doesn\u2019t take. Consider the long pause\u2014an eternity!\u2014when you say \u201cI love you\u201d and wait for them to say something. Or maybe you notice your partner wincing when you ask how you look in your bagel-print Hawaiian shirt. Or you smell alcohol on their breath when they kiss you goodnight and a few weeks ago they swore off drinking. 3. Open to what\u2019s going on in the moment. Acting as a defense, rumination can block us off from our own sensations, emotions, and impulses. In order to open yourself up to what\u2019s going on within you in the here and now, ask yourself these questions and notice what arises: \u201cWhat sensations am I aware of in my body right now?\u201d Then, stay tuned in to your body. Be patient and curious. \u201cWhat\u2019s here emotionally right now?\u201d Tune in to any emotional undercurrents within you. \u201cCan I notice my experience of this impulse in my body and choose to be with it rather than act on it? What\u2019s this impulse telling me?\u201d Tune in to impulses within you patiently and with curiosity, letting go of any outcome you\u2019re hoping for or dreading. Mindfulness practices can help as you try to orient yourself to the present. 4. Welcome vulnerability and the unknown. The final step is to welcome what\u2019s arising. One way is by asking a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s under this?\u201d This question communicates: I can take in what I\u2019ve pushed out of my own awareness. I\u2019m ready to recognize and accept what\u2019s here. It\u2019s OK not to understand the way your body responds as you listen and wait. Maybe you\u2019ll notice wisps of emotion. Or you might sense a surge of energy. There may be a twinge of discomfort or a rise in physical tension. Whatever it is, be with it while remaining grounded in your body, open, and tuned in. Sometimes, sustained, focused attention alone can amplify what your body is communicating and bring clarity. You\u2019ll always get an answer in some form. The absence of a response is also an answer. The answer you get doesn\u2019t have to make rational sense. The answer may come over the course of a minute, a day, or a week. It may come piecemeal, in seemingly random insights. Whatever arises, welcome it. Ultimately, this process allows us to increase our tolerance of uncomfortable emotions, sensations, and impulses and remain present to our own vulnerability rather than spinning imagined scenarios in our mind that distance us from what\u2019s happening in our bodies and lives in the here and now. The better you know yourself and what\u2019s going on for you beyond your overthinking, the better equipped you are to express your feelings and needs more authentically and directly, hear your partner\u2019s responses and feedback, and set limits based on self-awareness rather than anxiety. Cultivating vulnerability and authenticity helps partners foster connection. Breaking the cycle of anxious rumination doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s not magic. It happens one thought, trigger, and day at a time, one choice at a time. You and your partner are built to grow together, welcoming yourselves and each other more fully as you are right now. You don\u2019t have to overthink it. Greater Good wants to know: Do you think this article will influence your opinions or behavior?

      "content_text": "In a world with political polarization, war, extreme weather events , and increasing costs of living, we need to be able to cope as individuals and communities. Our capacity to cope with very real stressors in our lives\u2014our resilience\u2014can determine whether we thrive, just survive, or are deprived of a reasonable quality of life. Stress vs. resilience Resilience means having the ability to cope with, and rebound from, life\u2019s challenges and still achieve our goals. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month Stress isn\u2019t something to be avoided. We need to feel some stress to achieve our best. Exposure to manageable levels of stress and adversity develops our coping skills and resilience. But if we feel too much stress, we can flounder or become overwhelmed. The ability to re-activate ourselves when we feel down, fatigued, or disengaged helps to optimize our focus and motivation. Sportspeople, for example, might listen to high-intensity music just before a competition to increase their energy levels. Conversely, the ability to dampen down emotional intensity can make us feel less stressed or anxious. Exercising, listening to relaxing music, or patting a much-loved pet can prevent high arousal from interfering with completing a task. Effective emotion regulation is crucial for adapting to life\u2019s ups and downs, and keeping us on a relatively even keel. How does resilience develop? Resilience emerges from interactions between personal and environmental factors. In addition to emotion regulation skills, personal factors that can bolster resilience include academic achievement, developing a range of skills and abilities (such as sport and music), and problem-solving skills. Many of these skills can be fostered in childhood. And if one area of life isn\u2019t going well, we can still experience confidence, joy, and meaning in others. People who reflect on traumatic experience and develop new positive meanings about themselves ( getting through it means I\u2019m strong! ) and life (a greater appreciation) can also have higher levels of resilience. Genetic factors and temperament also play an important role. Some of us are born with nervous systems that respond with more anxiety than others in novel, uncertain, or potentially threatening situations. And some of us are more likely to avoid rather than approach these situations. These traits tend to be associated with lower levels of resilience. But we can all learn skills to build our resilience. Environmental factors that promote resilience include: a nurturing home environment supportive family and peer relationships cultural identity, belonging, and rituals modeling from others overcoming hardship community cohesion government policies that provide social safety nets, strong education, anti-discrimination, and inclusion investment in facilities, spaces, services, and networks that support the quality of life and well-being of communities. Can resilience be taught? Many factors associated with resilience are modifiable, so it stands to reason that interventions that aim to bolster them should be helpful. There is evidence that interventions that promote optimism, flexibility, active coping, and social support\u2013seeking can have small yet meaningful positive effects on resilience and emotional well-being in children and adults. However, school-based programs give us reason to be cautious. A trial across 84 schools in the United Kingdom evaluated the effectiveness of school-based mindfulness programs. More than 3,500 students aged between 11 and 13 years received 10 lessons of mindfulness and a similar number did not. There was no evidence that mindfulness had any benefit on risk for depression; social, emotional, and behavioral functioning; or well-being after one year. Teaching schoolchildren mindfulness at scale did not appear to bolster resilience. In fact, there was some evidence it did harm\u2014and it was most harmful for students at the highest risk of depression. The intervention was not deemed to be effective or cost-effective and was not recommended by the authors. In another recent trial , researchers found an emotion regulation intervention with year eight and nine schoolchildren was unhelpful and even harmful, although children who engaged in more home practice tended to do better. These interventions may have failed for a number of reasons. The content may not have been delivered in a way that was sufficiently engaging, comprehensive, age-appropriate, frequent, individually tailored, or relevant to the school context. Teachers may also not be sufficiently trained in delivering these interventions for them to be effective. And students didn\u2019t co-design the interventions. Regardless of the reasons, these findings suggest we need to be cautious when delivering universal interventions to all children. It may be more helpful to wait until there are early signs of excessive stress and intervene in an individualized way. What does this mean for resilience-building? Parents and schools have a role in providing children with the sense of security that gives them confidence to explore their environments and make mistakes in age-appropriate ways, and providing support when needed. Parents and teachers can encourage children to try to solve problems themselves before getting involved. Problem-solving attempts should be celebrated even more than success. Schools need to allocate their scarce resources to children most in need of practical and emotional support in non-stigmatizing ways, rather than universal approaches. Most children will develop resilience without intervention programs. To promote resilience, schools can foster positive peer relationships, cultural identity, and involvement in creative, sporting, and academic pursuits. They can also highlight others\u2019 recovery and resilience stories to demonstrate how growth can occur from adversity. More broadly in the community, people can work on developing their own emotion regulation skills to bolster their confidence in their ability to manage adversity. Think about how you can: approach challenges in constructive ways actively problem-solve rather than avoid challenges genuinely accept failure as part of being human establish healthy boundaries align your behavior with your values receive social and professional support when needed. This will help you navigate the ebbs and flows of life in ways that support recovery and growth. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
