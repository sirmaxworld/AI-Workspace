      "content_text": "Peace Begins With Me: A 12-Minute Meditation Taking a moment to pause can enable us to move in the direction of suffering, to work, and to alleviate it, with wisdom and compassion. By Rhonda Magee October 15, 2025 Calm This is a meditation that I sometimes rely on when I find myself feeling the reactivity that comes up from what\u2019s happening in the news, what\u2019s happening in our communities, what\u2019s happening in our country, and what\u2019s happening in the world right now. Whether it\u2019s because of the pandemic, a shooting, or an unnecessary killing of a good human being\u2014it happens too frequently. It happened to Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others. Take a moment to pause with all of the news coming at us, especially if you are someone who seeks to move in the direction of the suffering, to work, and to alleviate it, through actions and engagements in the world. This gentle practice can provide support to you in remaining grounded as you open up to information that may cause you pain. Peace Begins With Me: A 12-Minute Meditation Noticing any of these kinds of reactivities coming up for you , you can, as always, just take a few deep and conscious breaths. And as you do so, you\u2019re turning your attention in a very purposeful way toward these sensations that are coming up for you beneath the breath and in the body. Taking a long, slow breath in, and a gentle, even longer breath out. Continue to follow the flow of your breathing as best you can, resting your attention there. On an in-breath, breathe in for a count of four. Hold your breath for a count of seven, and then release for a count of eight. We\u2019re doing the four, seven, eight cycle here. So on the next in-breath, breathe in for four counts, hold for seven counts, and then release for eight counts. Repeat that four, seven, eight cycle of breathing in and out one or two times. Breathing out through the mouth, if at all possible. Now settle into a natural rhythm and as best you can , maintain awareness of the quality of your breath\u2014in and out. And rest as best you can, along the river of these sensations, resting in the long, broad, and deep now. As you rest, gently call to mind your desire and the will you have inside yourself for peace that begins with you. For well-being that begins right here, right now, in your own body and being and spirit, for justice that begins here. Perhaps on the next in-breath, consciously focus on the love and compassion that exists in your own heart . The peace that can begin with you right now\u2014extending through you, right now. As you breathe in, bring greater awareness to this love. This warm, loving softness within you. Or other characteristics that you sense in your own experience, other ways you would describe your own warming heart and the will in your heart for justice and positive social community, for global change. As much as possible, allow yourself to completely feel the compassion in your being for everyone who\u2019s suffering \u2014obviously in a way that includes you, includes all of us. And particularly those who are suffering the most in your community and in the world right now, wherever they may be. So as you breathe in and out, breathing in the sense of awareness of the love in your heart , and breathing out very consciously, sending loving support toward all those you believe to be in need of it in this very moment. Breathe in a sense of your own loving heart and what is well within you, and while breathing out, gently extending the wish for well-being from your own head to toe, and flowing out through you, to the communities you meet and touch and work with. And out as far as my reach can go, circling the globe. As you bring this meditation gently to a close, take a moment to appreciate all that you are , all that you do. The body that is carrying you through this very life in all its perfect imperfections\u2014just as you are. Call forth an intention for staying grounded and holding with grace, your spirit, your being, and your energy for the work today.

Writer and mindfulness teacher Ed Halliwell on how mindfulness helps him navigate anxiety and depression. By Ed Halliwell October 9, 2025 Guided Meditations Feeling overwhelmed is a common trigger for my anxiety attacks . A project doesn\u2019t go as well as I\u2019d hoped or I miss a deadline, and fear and insecurity rise in my mind and body. \u201cI\u2019m going to be judged and found wanting,\u201d goes the narrative. \u201cThey won\u2019t want to work with me again. Who was I anyway to take on such a job? I\u2019m an imposter. I always fall at the last hurdle.\u201d My heart starts racing, my stomach churns, my muscles stiffen. These sensations are unpleasant, so I tense up further in an unconscious attempt not to feel them, even while my attention is pulled in their direction. Oh no, says a new thought. Why am I getting so anxious and blocked. With so much energy expended internally, there\u2019s less available to attend to daily matters. Panic may set in. \u201cNow I can\u2019t get any other work done,\u201d my mind laments. \u201cIt\u2019s the old cycle downwards again. I\u2019m cursed with depression .\u201d The familiar pressure builds up in my nose and chest, making it difficult to access any other feelings, and the negativity starts to spiral: I won\u2019t be able to cope, I\u2019ll be left with no money, no energy, unable to dig myself out of this hole. The doom-mongering thoughts fuel even more anxiety . It could go on indefinitely\u2014a self-fulfilling prophecy. With so much energy expended internally, there\u2019s less available to attend to daily matters. But hang on a minute. If these thoughts are just thoughts \u2014and probably mere projections, tainted by the negative bias that comes especially at times of stress \u2014then there\u2019s no need to follow them. Anxiety is a feeling, and I know that feelings come and go. Yesterday\u2019s thoughts and feelings were different, so who\u2019s to say my internal weather isn\u2019t due another change? There are patterns of experience, for sure, but this moment is just a vibration of energy experienced in consciousness, created by constellations of events in the mind, body, and outside world around a so-called \u201cme\u201d that in reality has no fixed location. Ideas in the mind are in flux, sensations in the body are in flux, and the trigger events are already receding into memory\u2014no more than traces of causal energy that set the winds of mental and physical habit blowing. Suddenly, with this shift in perspective, thoughts, and feelings are no longer facts, and there\u2019s not even a solid, single, separate \u201cme\u201d to feel upset or hurt by them. There is just experience, happening on and on. It\u2019s painful experience right now, to be sure, but just energy in motion nevertheless. I\u2019m changing from moment to moment, too\u2014 everything is in flow , as it always is. This won\u2019t stay the same, and nor will I. \u201cNo Feeling is Final.\u201d Rainer Maria Rilke once said: \u201cLet everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.\u201d We can make it even less personal. Just let everything happen (drop the \u201cto you\u201d)\u2014watch and feel each aspect of the mind\u2013body\u2013world show play out on the stage of consciousness, experiencing it all with interest and kindness in the knowledge that the moment is already and inevitably on its way to becoming something else. If the energy is allowed to play out by itself, the next moments are less likely to be conditioned by misguided attempts to turn what is flowing into something solid, or to push away what is here so it\u2019s no longer part of the moment. Neither solidifying nor separating from the moment can ever be successful, because the moment is always both here and in transition. But if there is no depression to get stuck in, and no self to get hurt, then everything in mind, body, and life can flow like an undammed river, with energy streaming through without the defensive psychic barriers that serve only to turn that energy in on itself. By shifting perspective and approach\u2014experiencing without grasping and resistance\u2014this moment has already become different from how it might have been. Negative thoughts\u2014as well as the bodily symptoms of fear \u2014may still be present. But they are not \u201cmine\u201d any more. They just are\u2014present remnants of past events that do not need to be turned into unnecessary future suffering. By shifting perspective and approach\u2014experiencing without grasping and resistance\u2014this moment has already become different from how it might have been. A Mountain Meditation to Help You Shift Out of Panic Mode This mindfulness practice, often referred to as \u201cthe mountain meditation,\u201d can help us center in our bodies especially in the midst of life\u2019s shifting swirls. By imagining and then embodying the steadiness of a mountain, we\u2019re training in being present to the weather of the world, as well as to our own internal weather: our thoughts and sensations. 1) Settle into an upright, comfortable sitting posture . Present and awake. Gentle and steady. Connected to the ground below. Body rising up into the air. 2) Imagine in your mind\u2019s eye a beautiful mountain . It could be a mountain you\u2019ve climbed or viewed from a distance, or perhaps one you\u2019ve seen in a film or picture. Or maybe one you\u2019ve just conjured up in your mind. Either way, visualize a mountain that for your embodies majesty and magnificence, full of natural wonder. 3) Notice the awesome qualities of the mountain : See in your mind how its foot is grounded firmly in the earth and how it rises up into the air unapologetically and fully taking its place in the landscape. Bring awareness to its solidity, its stillness, its strength, and its size. Come day or night, storm and sun, winter and summer, the mountain abides in the space, sitting still in its landscape, unwavering whatever the weather. It doesn\u2019t have to do anything. It just is. A beautiful mountain. Amazing just by its very existence. And whether it\u2019s sunny, snowing, blowing a gale, hot, warm, cool, or cold, the mountain just is there, sitting present. 4) Notice your own mountainous qualities as you sit here . Just like the mountain is plugged into the earth, so your feet are connected to the ground. Your body rising upwards like the body of the mountain. Your head rests on your shoulders like the peak of the mountain and you can be here, fully present like the mountain sits in its space. Your body and being as miraculous as the mountain that evokes such wonder just by its presence. Like the mountain, being an embodiment of stillness, solidity, beauty, without having to do anything else. There may be weather going on of course: events in life, thoughts, and sensations ebbing and flowing in the internal and external environment. Whatever the weather, just for now, practice being a \u201cbreathing body mountain.\u201d Naturally wonderful, whether the weather seems pleasant or unpleasant. Let the climates of the world happen: being rained on, shined on, snowed on\u2014stay present as best you can to whatever comes. 5) When the mind wanders, invite attention back to the sense of being a mountain or if you prefer, let your attention rest on the mountain in your mind for a while before returning to sensations in the body. Let go of the need to feel a particular way. If you don\u2019t feel mountainous, that\u2019s fine. This practice invites you to cultivate a quality rather than fabricate a feeling: just being a \u201cbreathing body mountain.\u201d This post was adapted from Into The Heart of Mindfulness , by Ed Halliwell, published by Piatkus).

      "content_text": "Shifting Habits: Three Mindful Parenting Tips You Can Try Today Susan Kaiser Greenland offers three mindful parenting tips to help kids pause and reflect so they can identify and shift habits. By Susan Kaiser Greenland October 6, 2025 Kids and Teens We all have habits\u2014some of them helpful or neutral, others that persistently create problems in our lives. It\u2019s easier for kids to change habits than grown-ups. One way to start recognising your pattern of automatic behavior is to create external signals that will automatically show up throughout the day. These three mindful parenting tips can be interrupters that provide an opportunity to pause and reflect. 1. Create mindfulness reminders I have seen kids tie a string around one finger, make mindfulness bracelets of ribbons or beads, or tape a colorful sticker to their cell phones. Whenever you see them, just pause to take in what\u2019s happening in your mind and body. 2. Implement breathing prompts Suggest to your children to practice breath awareness whenever they brush their teeth or put their socks on. Breathing prompts help kids recognise just how many things they do are on automatic pilot. By interrupting automatic behavior, kids have the time and mental space to make connections between what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re thinking, and how they\u2019re feeling. 3. Notice funny feelings Kids talk about having a funny feeling in the split second just before they do something that they later wish they hadn\u2019t done, maybe a tightening in their chests, or a sinking feeling in their stomachs. That funny feeling occurs in the \u201cabout to\u201d moment . By noticing their funny feelings, kids pause before they act to ask: Why am I choosing to do this? How does it make me feel? Is my motivation friendly or unfriendly? If, upon reflection, the action doesn\u2019t feel right, they can choose to act differently. Photo \u00a9 flickr.com/Josh Kenzer",

      "content_text": "The \u201cAbout To\u201d Moment: Teaching and Modeling Response vs. Reaction Children learn largely by example. Susan Kaiser Greenland explains how the \"about to\" moment can foster awareness and compassion. By Susan Kaiser Greenland October 6, 2025 Kids and Teens iStockPhoto.com/Juanmonino Have you ever noticed a funny feeling in your body the split-second before doing something you later regret? Maybe the funny feeling is a tightening in your chest, or a flush of heat rushing to your face, or a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. These funny feelings can take place in what Western meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein calls the \u201cabout to\u201d moment. This moment is the split-second before you speak or act. We can train ourselves to identify when the \u201cabout to\u201d moment is occurring in our lives, and notice the internal signals that accompany it. By paying attention to the physical sensations that sometimes accompany an \u201cabout to\u201d moment, we have an opportunity to pause before acting and reflect on what we\u2019re about to do or say. This is a chance to ask ourselves critical questions, like: \u201cWhy choose to act in this way?\u201d \u201cHow does it make me feel?\u201d \u201cWill what I\u2019m about to do or say lead me and my family closer to, or further away from, genuine happiness?\u201d Parenting in the \u201cAbout To\u201d Moment The \u201cabout to\u201d moment has special relevance to parenting because it is also the place and time where we choose (whether consciously or not) what we teach our children by example. It is a chance to shift direction if we recognize that our automatic reaction to a stressful situation is not consistent with our image of the parent we hope to be, or the adults we hope our children will become. Character development is a life-long process, happening through repeated actions both large and small. One place it happens is during the countless \u201cabout to\u201d moments in our lives. In 2018, several prestigious universities published a study about the effect of spanking on three-year-old children. They reported that three-year-olds who had been spanked by their mothers more than twice in the month prior to the time they were assessed by researchers had an increased risk for higher levels of child aggression at age five than children who had not been spanked. Even though this finding is consistent with a well-established body of academic literature on the topic, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents refrain from spanking entirely, the reporting of this study has been somewhat controversial. In the comment section of several blogs about the research, some people have taken offense. Perhaps because many parents continue to spank their kids, even those as young as three. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, more than 90 per cent of families report having used spanking as a form of discipline. The \u201cabout to\u201d moment, when a parent chooses to spank a child, is an opportunity for the parent to ask what he or she is trying to accomplish. Spanking is, at the very least, a stressful life experience for both parent and child, and it is well known that stressful life events can have a profound impact on brain development, especially in young children. In their book Born for Love: Why Empathy is Essential , Dr. Bruce Perry and Maia Szalavitz explain that when early childhood experiences are nurturing and empathetic, a child\u2019s nervous system will wire up one way. If early childhood experiences are stressful, harsh and frightening, the same child\u2019s brain wires up in a different way. \u201cAbout to\u201d moments can make learning and later relationships easier or more challenging. I doubt that any parent, upon reflection, hopes that his or her actions will make it more difficult for kids to learn and get along with others at school or home. Self-Reflection, Compassion, and Modeling The \u201cabout to\u201d moment is also an opportunity to reflect on the quality that one is reinforcing within oneself and modeling for one\u2019s kids . For example, is striking out in response to behavior that we disagree with/disapprove of a quality that we want to strengthen in ourselves? Is it one we want to model for our child? Will teaching children that it\u2019s OK to hit other people help them become their best selves? Help them have an easier time on the playground? Lead them toward genuine happiness? The choices that we make in our \u201cabout to\u201d moments determine who we are and who we will become. They also let our kids know loud and clear what\u2019s important to us. Making the choice to exercise restraint, empathy, compassion and even-handedness time and time again is how these qualities become habitual in both parent and child. For example, when our kids see us being kind to others, we\u2019re both practicing kindness ourselves and modeling it for them. When they watch us exercise patience while waiting our turn in the grocery line or when stuck in traffic, we\u2019re both modeling patience to our kids and practicing it ourselves. When we find nonviolent ways to address inappropriate behavior we\u2019re both modeling nonviolence and practicing it ourselves. To borrow from Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cCharacter is higher than intellect.\u201d It is the choices we make in the \u201cabout to\u201d moments\u2014choices we make over and over again all day every day\u2014that determine our character and set an example for our children to follow.

By Barry Boyce March 21, 2018 Podcasts pabloprat/Adobe Stock Point of View Podcast Episode 7: When Mindfulness and Racism Intersect 1:23:45 A conversation with Rhonda Magee exploring how mindfulness can help us dismantle the subtle patterns and habits that separate us from each other. Barry Boyce: Welcome everyone to Mindful\u2019s podcast, Point of View. I\u2019m Barry Boyce, editor-in-chief of Mindful and mindful.org. And today I have the pleasure of talking with my good friend and colleague Rhonda Magee . Rhonda is a Professor of Law at the University of San Francisco and she\u2019s a mindfulness teacher who\u2019s been focused for some years on issues having to do with mindfulness and the law, mindfulness for lawyers in their everyday work, justice, public policy, and in particular focusing increasingly on issues of inclusively, ingroup/outgroup, bias, and she is pioneering something she calls Color Insight, which we\u2019ll talk about later on. So, welcome Rhonda. Rhonda Magee: Thank you very much Barry, it\u2019s good to be with you. Barry Boyce: You and I met for the first time, quite a few years ago now, it must be, at a retreat in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in a beautiful forest. I recall we had an opportunity to take a couple of walks around there and get to know each other, and I got a good chance to begin to know you. If you don\u2019t mind, if you could tell a little bit of your background for our listeners, you know how you grew up and where you grew up and then work your way towards how you ended up practicing mindfulness. Rhonda Magee: So I grew up in the south. I was born in 1967, right, so 50 years on the planet\u201450 good years, I would say, although the last few have been more challenging than many in the past. So, born in South, born actually in the last year of Martin Luther King\u2019s time on earth. A very poignant time in American history where we were bringing the civil rights movement, in a certain sense, to a kind of peak in terms of articulating the promises of a movement for inclusivity that would be supported by law and public policy and might change the culture. And so, I think my own journey here was influenced, in some not insignificant way, by the fact that I was born then and there, raised in a family that was Christian, and particularly influenced by a grandmother and others in the family who were deeply committed to religious practice and to a kind of a discipline of daily, what they would call prayer and study, but look very much like a kind of daily meditation, and discipline, if you will. So, witnessing as a little girl, seeing my grandmother practice every day, get up in the morning before dawn, commit herself to a kind of centering, and then going out in the world and working very hard. She didn\u2019t have a glamorous job, she cleaned houses for other people and took care of the family and on the weekends helped to support community\u2014She had become a lay minister in a particular Christian tradition. So, I grew up then in a family that was already kind of deeply engaged in the idea of practice and daily practice for one\u2019s own sustenance, in a world that wasn\u2019t necessarily created for our thriving. But also to support us in the work of trying to make the world as livable and kind as possible for ourselves and for our communities. There are ways we can call people into conversations about white supremacy with compassion for the fact that we all are in this together. We\u2019ve all been trained away from this conversation. I moved from North Carolina to Virginia, did most of my schooling in Virginia, went to the University of Virginia, studied law and sociology at the graduate level, and then ended up teaching at the University of San Francisco. For me, mindfulness came, first of all, in an organic way. I was always very drawn to solitude and drawn to my own developing inner work\u00a0and found mindfulness in particular\u00a0or meditation, I should say, first in 1993, the year I came out from the south to San Francisco. And at this moment of new opportunity\u2014I was starting a new job as a lawyer having trained and focused and done all these different things, but also was in this brand new place with everything around me sort of new and different, and starting this fancy job at a law firm where I was the only African-American, only young woman of color at the time in an office of about 70 or so lawyers\u2014I just already knew there were going to be some additional challenges that would come with that beyond the everyday challenges of being a young lawyer. So, I felt at that time a need to be more consistent and committed to my own personal practice regimen, and so started exploring ways of deepening my own ground, my own sources of inner support, that were more aligned with who I had become by then. I\u2019m still very inspired by Christ\u2019s message and teachings, and yet, at the same time, for me I needed a way of entering into a spiritual journey that was a little more informed by practices that specifically would assist me in working with my own mind, knowing my own kind of conditioning and habits, and specifically putting myself in a position to deal with stress and to deal with my own reactivity and ways of being in the world that might make for more suffering than I needed to endure. So, I was drawn to meditation, I was drawn to mindfulness, and from there just developed a regular practice that led me to teaching and training through a variety of wonderful teachers, including Norman Fischer , a former abbot of The San Francisco Zen Center who has been a teacher of mine for years, and then actually, more recently, 10 or 12 years ago, met Jon Kabat-Zinn along the way, and through his inspiration prepared myself for mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention-type teaching by going to the teacher training program at the Center for Mindfulness . So that\u2019s in a nutshell. Barry Boyce: Yeah, that\u2019s a beautiful nutshell. And, you know, it seems to me that you grew up in what we might call today, in the jargon, an intentional community. Your grandmother, you say, who was a lay minister, is it fair to say that you derived a lot of strength from that community growing up? Rhonda Magee: Yeah, I mean, it is fair. And it\u2019s also fair to say the community had its back up against the wall, in many ways, right? So, it was still very segregated. My kindergarten school, despite the fact that it was by then 1972 when I was entering kindergarten, it was still officially segregated in the South, nothing had changed, despite Brown versus Board. Barry Boyce: Yeah, you hear: \u201cwell, during the Jim Crow period\u201d as if that ended. Rhonda Magee: Right, it still continues. And yet, it had a certain kind of flavor when it was completely, and in very intensive ways, supported and endorsed by our legal system and by our police and by our churches. Right? So, while segregation continues, actually, in a way that I do think is important to really be clear about, the difference between the kind of very official commitments and explicit endorsements of white supremacy that were in place throughout, even starting my lifetime, between what was in place then and what\u2019s in place now, which is not as much. We\u2019re re-entering, I would say, a period where people are re-embracing white supremacy in a way that actually is quite meaningful and it\u2019s important, and we need to talk about that, it\u2019s part of why I do the work that I do. But yeah, I had this period in my life where the dominant message was to respond to and redress white supremacy, to make a society that was fair. And I wouldn\u2019t be here if we hadn\u2019t gone through that period, where we had a civil rights movement that led to changes in public policy, that led to opening up educational opportunities for people like me, opportunities that literally weren\u2019t there before\u2014Actually dismantling , to a degree, the patterns of segregation that had been in place that are resurfacing today. So, I think part of what needs to be understood is we actually did make a lot of change\u2014change that lead to me be literally being here in this conversation with you, that lead to electing Barack Obama as president, and many other things. And we are now at a moment societally where all of that change is facing probably the most intense backlash that I\u2019ve ever seen in my lifetime. And so, mindfulness, for me, increasingly became a support for looking clearly at what needs to be seen with regard to those issues. I was already teaching a class dealing with race and law\u2014I have taught such a class at the University of San Francisco and other places, William and Mary College in Virginia. But my main place has been at USF, with very diverse groups of students\u2014from new immigrant families, first-generation students from all over the world, African-American, white students\u2014all coming together to try to learn American legal history and the way in which race and bias has been a feature of our history since the founding. Barry Boyce: I\u2019d like to return to that topic a little later on\u00a0in a deeper way. But first I want to talk a little bit about community. You said you were in a community that had its back up against the wall and yet managed to derive some strength in the middle of that struggle, and even including, in the face of a real hate. I think for a lot of people, mindfulness is something that would be strengthened by community. We (at Mindful) are now in our fifth anniversary, in fact this podcast is our fifth-anniversary\u00a0celebration podcast, so you\u2019ve been chosen to lead that off. We\u2019re using the slogan of \u201cmindfulness for all\u201d and yet in many ways, mindfulness practice seems to be a phenomenon of the mainstream privilege culture, even though there are a number of good programs that are breaking down some barriers. But, there are a lot more barriers to be broken down, obviously, before we can say that mindfulness feels like something that is truly accessible to all. Could you say something about what you think the barriers are to greater inclusion in a bigger spectrum of mindfulness practitioners? Rhonda Magee: Yeah, and it links, I do think, in important ways to this notion of community. I do think that the kind of experience that I shared about growing up in a world where I was very aware of suffering. It wasn\u2019t an abstraction. And the idea of finding support for dealing with suffering and then realizing that this is not a personal project, that indeed, we do what we do for ourselves but we do it in community always. We\u2019re always embedded in community. That was something that was always very apparent to me. And so for me, when I look at the western mindfulness scene, I do think a barrier to allowing its rich potential to infuse and enrich the lives of a broader and broader swath of our human population is the way that it\u2019s taught in the midst of a society that hasn\u2019t reckoned with racism, sexism, and all the other isms, very well. Right? So, a part of the way in which we haven\u2019t reckoned with those things is the hyper-focus on individualism. To disconnect, denude our experience from its embeddedness in community and culture. Right? So, that is kind of hand and glove with racism, sexism, homophobia, all of that, is to deny the relevance of culture, of community, of history. Deep in the cultural structures of this society, of western societies, and many societies in the world right now, are hidden ways of perpetuating the status quo, including perpetuating racism, sexism, et cetera. And one of those sort of subtle ways is to hyper-focus on the individual. It\u2019s not about sex or race. It\u2019s really about you as an individual and whether or not you can overcome. And, through no intentional fault of its own, I think mindfulness has been taken up in the midst of that culture. When I look at the western mindfulness scene, I do think a barrier to allowing its rich potential to infuse and enrich the lives of a broader and broader swath of our human population is the way that it\u2019s taught in the midst of a society that hasn\u2019t reckoned with racism, sexism, and all the other isms, very well. Barry Boyce: So, what you\u2019re really saying, the first thing you bring up here, in terms of barriers, it\u2019s very interesting, it\u2019s kind of a very deep and subtle barrier of making it a personal improvement project. Is that really what you\u2019re saying? That doesn\u2019t begin with you as a social being who embodies a culture, as part of a culture. Is that really what you\u2019re driving at? Rhonda Magee: Yeah, absolutely. You know, it begins with the personal improvement project. And the difficulty is, that there is a very important role for the personal improvement project. The difficulty is that focusing on individual efforts, practice, and so on, is really essential to mindfulness to the liberatory potential of mindfulness, the freedom that can come from that. It\u2019s essential for us to have personal commitments. The problem is that in our society it\u2019s sort of either or, it\u2019s either about the personal or it\u2019s about the social. And yet, if we can open to our own experience we know we\u2019re always already both individuals and a world. And I think, again, the challenge is to convey mindfulness as about a practice for individuals in a world, in communities, in systems. So it\u2019s more nuanced in a profound way, bringing mindfulness forward as it is, which is a support for individuals embedded in communities and systems that are constantly a part of what it is that we struggle with, what sets us up for the particular kinds of suffering that we endure. So, it\u2019s to deepen and move us away from this tendency to only focus on the individual and to infuse it: it\u2019s individual and community, it\u2019s \u201cboth and.\u201d And mindfulness, I think, because it opens up our capacity to see things through multiple lenses at once, has a profound ability to help us, and in that sense lead Western culture forward. Because I think our entire culture suffers from these false dichotomies, the inability to see the world through multiple lenses at once, to deal with that kind of complexity, in a world beset with more and more complex problems. Barry Boyce: So, that is a very fundamental barrier that we could contemplate for quite a while, and I\u2019d like to see if there are any other discreet barriers that you could mention, or that come to mind, and then I\u2019d like to talk about some practical first steps that might help to loosen those things up. In addition to just what you already said about contemplating that dichotomy and the unavoidable fact of being an individual and communal person at the same time. So, what are some other barriers that come to mind for you? Rhonda Magee: Yeah, so relatedly, we largely continued to live in very segregated communities and cultures and systems. And that\u2019s a fact that is one that we struggle to keep coming back to. You know, we know that part of the way we\u2019ve been taught to look at these issues is that we were segregated officially, and now we\u2019re not. And now if communities are racially identifiable or culturally distinct, it\u2019s all a matter of choice. It\u2019s all, you know, a matter of the market. It\u2019s not, about patterns or conditioned habits and also structures, the way we do schooling, public and private, the way we continue to structure our religious communities. We tend not to really see how we are very, very, very deeply still embedded in and committed to, actually, we have a taste for, it seems like, segregation. Barry Boyce: We reinvest invest in boundaries that we think we\u2019ve gone beyond, mentally, in our media, we reinvest in those boundaries. Rhonda Magee: We really do. Barry Boyce: \u2026that you are more different from me than is really the case. Rhonda Magee: Yes, and we reinvest\u00a0meaning, we send our kids to schools that are still very isolated. We move around the country. I live in San Francisco. I hear people find various and sundry different ways to explain why they leave a very diverse region. And often my white friends, for example, find themselves in much more white spaces after the \u201cstresses of the city.\u201d And, you know, sometimes this racial piece of it is mentioned, often not widely, but maybe in these quiet conversations. I had a young woman come and talk to me about a friend of hers; it\u2019s often, you know, speaking about a friend, not myself. This young woman was an immigrant from Eastern Europe and she had another friend, an immigrant from Eastern Europe, who came to San Francisco and said she wanted to move away because she wanted to be around more Americans, and by that, she actually meant more whites. There still is a way that part of the legacy of white supremacy in America is that we define what it means to be American, still and in the eyes of many both domestically and internationally, as white. And that is what we are still up against, is what we have been seeing emerge in the political culture and the discourse around making America great again. So there\u2019s a deeply embedded desire, or kind of a way in which we keep moving into segregation and reinforcing it, reinvesting in it, as you say. We\u2019re all in that world. So, even mindfulness organizations are built up in networks that are already very segregated. All of our networks for reaching out, finding potential teachers, finding people to come to our organizations, our events, they\u2019re already very segregated. And so, we are up against that challenge of, again, living in a society that\u2019s already structured to push us apart. And those dynamics are coming from so many different institutions that it\u2019s actually very hard for any institution to start reaching out to adults, adult learners or adult practitioners, and saying let\u2019s come together from these very different places of relative segregation and isolation. And so a concrete way to address that is, I mean, there are short-term steps, but I actually think a longer-term cultural change is what has to happen. This effort must outlive our own lifetimes. It will. Another problem we deal with in the West is very short-term focus. If we can\u2019t imagine our efforts realizing some gain tomorrow, or at the outside six months from now, we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s worth our time. We are not going to change these patterns in this country that took hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years to embed without a commitment to changing them that is at least as farsighted. We are not going to change these patterns in this country that took hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years to embed without a commitment to changing them that is at least as farsighted. Barry Boyce: Are you suggesting that if you have too much of a hunger for immediate results, you won\u2019t really commit? That you really have to take on that notion that we\u2019re planting seeds in a garden that we will not see flower? I haven\u2019t really thought of it that way: If silently in your mind you think you want to see a short-term gain, you just give up\u2026 Rhonda Magee: It\u2019s very easy to get frustrated. Barry Boyce: You think\u2026 this neighborhood isn\u2019t going to change. Rhonda Magee: Yes, the community isn\u2019t going to change, this meditation group isn\u2019t going to change. Barry Boyce: Yeah. So yeah that\u2019s very helpful. Keep going. Rhonda Magee: So, we need both a very long-term commitment and a lot of patience, both of which, I think, are gifts from me of my own mindfulness practice. And not that I\u2019ve gotten there, right, I\u2019m a work in progress just like everybody else. But to be able to sit with the frustration that comes with, oh, here we are again trying to address this same issue of the denial of white supremacy in our history with people who, once again, don\u2019t want to talk about. It\u2019s frustrating. Barry Boyce: How does patience square with the possibility of falling into apathy or not being willing to call somebody on something? Rhonda Magee: So it\u2019s \u201cboth and\u201d again. You know, realizing there\u2019s time for, and a place in our own being in the world, for patience. And there are times for, and a place for, being in action. And it\u2019s again, it\u2019s not either or. It really is both. So there are ways we can call people into conversations about white supremacy with compassion for the fact that we all are in this together. We\u2019ve all been trained away from this conversation. So, it\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s going to have to go by fits and starts and be interrupted, maybe even for years in a single organization because we\u2019re not ready for it yet. To really deal with these issues is high pay-grade level mindfulness work. It isn\u2019t for people who have not really come to see the depth of what it means to see clearly, what it means to work with our own conditionings, to sit in the fire of the painful recognition that, oh my mind actually does orient me to people who look like me. Oh, I do feel safer. Honestly, I wish I didn\u2019t, but in fact I do feel safer when I\u2019m in these places. Mindfulness can help us with a lot of the really subtle difficulties of doing the work that must be done to dismantle these patterns and habits that draw us to reinvest in segregation. Mindfulness compassion practices, these actually can help. Mindfulness can help us with a lot of the really subtle difficulties of doing the work that must be done to dismantle these patterns and habits that draw us to reinvest in segregation. So, it\u2019s actually, it\u2019s both that kind of patience that comes with a mindful holding of a multi-generational looking back and forward at the same time type of project. Because we are both, looking at a particular history is how we got here and trying to imagine a future for our children and our children\u2019s children that will be much different. And then trying to work towards that future, in part by trying to redeem our past, looking at the role our particular communities, our particular families, our cultures have had in setting us on this journey that we\u2019re on that keeps pushing us in corners and polarizing us. What\u2019s been the role of our family, our culture, my neighborhood, my own conditioning in those tendencies? How can I address those and at the same time realize that we\u2019re not going to address them overnight? We can\u2019t. It will not happen overnight. We didn\u2019t get here overnight. But we can take steps, we can take steps. Barry Boyce: You know, as you\u2019re talking about how we feel more comfortable in certain spaces, it reminds me of what some of the fabric of culture is made of: cultures are made of ways of being together, they\u2019re made of language. And there\u2019s a principle called high context communication, that, say, within your family and in North Carolina you have a particular way of talking and being, and communicating that everyone understands together. And if you bring somebody else into that they feel awkward. Rhonda Magee: Right. Barry Boyce: How do we deal with the power of cultures and yet try to do something that\u2019s transcultural? Do we need to create some embryonic mindfulness communities that we are at first, maybe, artificially structuring so that there are more types of people involved? Do you understand I\u2019m driving at? Rhonda Magee: I do. Barry Boyce: And I know that you\u2019ve been a longtime board member of the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society, and it has some very big aims in terms of helping to transform all sorts of systems with mindful awareness. So how would you respond to what I\u2019m talking about there? Rhonda Magee: So, I thank you for this question. I think that it is getting at really the deep challenge that we\u2019re talking about. You know, I\u2019m a teacher in many different senses. As one example, I get to have 14 weeks with one group of students. But I\u2019ve developed a course that I teach, for example, over 14 weeks, one called Contemplative Lawyering, one called Race and Law, Race in American Legal History. And in both I\u2019ve been allowed by the institution that I work in\u2014not everybody\u2019s gotten this kind of permission wherever they might be\u2014to actually bring mindfulness and compassion practices together r with looking at the legal structures that support both oppression and may support fighting for a more just world. So, what I do in those classes for 14 weeks is help the students develop a kind of community, a kind of new way of being with the suffering that they have seen, naming it, having the language to speak\u2014so, emotional intelligence\u2014having the language to talk about what suffering looks like from their high context and to try to translate that into something that others in that room, a very diverse group, can understand and find their way into from their own high context position, their position of difference. So, what we do in those 14 weeks is really try to practice this. But, I do think something along the lines of those kinds of intentional engaged communities, where we say, \u201cWe, this group of people, is gonna meet on a regular basis.\u201d And so I, like others, you know, John Paul Lederach, who\u2019s an internationally known peacemaker, a practitioner of peace and writer about peace studies. You know, he\u2019s talked about how we have to have these conversations with each other that we\u2019re willing to stay in for a lifetime. Like, meet somebody for coffee that will start a conversation that will last for the rest of our lives. And that\u2019s ultimately what I think we need to do. So, they\u2019re going to be many small ways of doing that\u2014an eight week course that\u2019s focused on coming together regularly, a 14-week course, a yearlong course, a community gathering space, where we drop in and we drop out, but we know we\u2019re building the capacity to do this together and to come together. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one way to do it, but I do think, once we start having this kind of conversation where start seeing there\u2019s a need for both a kind of intentional commitment to community that is about trying to open the doorways into our different ways of being based on our particular context, our particular cultures, and connect across them. There are so many ways to do that once we decide that\u2019s what we want to do. So, I think the first step is to see the imperative. We live in the 21st century, a radically diverse world and country right now, our own America, but interconnected with a world whose cultural and other differences are very, very profound. And yet we have never developed the intentional kinds of technologies, if you will, that address in deep ways what it means to bring people together across those cultures. I think mindfulness and compassion can help with that. We live in the 21st century, a radically diverse world \u2026 and yet we have never developed the intentional kinds of technologies, if you will, that address in deep ways what it means to bring people together across those cultures. I think mindfulness and compassion can help with that. Barry Boyce: Well I think, one of the things I hear you recommending here is that, in addition to long-term patience and short-term persistence, is that maybe there are possibilities for the kind of embryos I was talking about, in the sense that your semester is a time and a place in a container where we can\u2019t hide. And with mindfulness, we have an opportunity to engage, with some kindness and compassion, the ways in which we invest in separateness. Rhonda Magee: And also just learn from each other and live with the experience of togetherness. We don\u2019t have that. We don\u2019t have a lot of experience to draw on. Barry Boyce: Yeah, actually, that\u2019s interesting. Because in that if you\u2019re living that experience you actually can get some reward from it, that begins to taste and feel good to you, you want more of that, and that I hadn\u2019t really appreciated until you just said that. Rhonda Magee: This is very true. This, I think, is the heart of it. I mean this is why desegregation and integration when it worked, and I will say I think it worked in my own experience in many ways. Policies of bringing people together, you know, I was thrown into a school that was affirmatively trying to be bussed for desegregation, and all that. But it was at a time when the community had stopped resisting, publicly. So there weren\u2019t people out on the streets, parents saying no. We were going to school together. That meant we went to band class together. Meaning whites, African-Americans, and the 10 or 12 percent of \u201cother\u201d in the south\u2014it was mostly black and white and a small percentage of so-called \u201cother\u201d so people from a variety of different backgrounds. But we were in that, in those close spaces working together, and learning from each other, in a way that actually was joyful. And, I do think, that is what my students experience in those classrooms. I know. I mean, I\u2019ve had students marry people, who find themselves move from: \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine dating outside my group,\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ve now married a person from a totally different culture and it was because of what happened in that class that made it possible for me to do that.\u201d So, I do know that the heart of this is Joy. I do think that we don\u2019t understand how we\u2019re all missing out on the joy of rich human community. We think that, you know, the greatest benefit is what we\u2019ve been told it is, right: How to make the pie bigger for our own. How to make sure my children, you know, have one step ahead of other people. These are the things that we\u2019ve been taught to fight for, to strive for. We haven\u2019t had enough experience with another kind of powerful means for success\u2014which is, what it means to be a rich, diverse, culturally nuanced community. We just don\u2019t know that, most of us, and therefore we are afraid of it. Barry Boyce: So I think that\u2019s an excellent jumping off point for talking about color blindness. And you firmly reject that idea of colorblindness in favor of what you call, a term we\u2019ve coined, color insight. Can you describe the difference between those two? Rhonda Magee: Yeah. So color blindness, is this idea that, and it comes from a beautiful place, I think, but the idea is that the way to get beyond bias is to just not see it, not talk about it, not recognize ever, as much as possible, in our public discourse\u2014not to recognize that these differences exist. In fact, our brains don\u2019t operate that way. Of course, we know differences exist. We\u2019ve been raised in a world that has taught us a lot about what these differences mean. So, whether we\u2019re talking about race or gender, We are we notice these things. Barry Boyce: I think you may have used a practical example with me before, at one point. You could say that law is colorblind, but then, when you\u2019re in a courtroom your brain and your mind can perceive that there is, in that young black defendant, there is a palpable weakness against the system represented by the bench. Rhonda Magee: Right. So that is the question: How do you deal with the fact that we do notice these things and yet our culture has been telling us: \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Don\u2019t talk about it. In fact, if you raise it you might be called racist. If you if you turn us toward that you might be part of the problem, that might be divisive.\u201d So yeah, it\u2019s a very interesting thing that we did over the last generation. I will say it happened over the last generation, although, that\u2019s a kind of an oversimplification of it. But, we\u2019ve got this beautiful language from Martin Luther King, his \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. He wants a world in which his children will be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. And there has been a, sort of a, cynical way that that beautiful aspiration, which, for King was always embedded in a knowing of the depth of the way in which we do see each other through race and through those lenses. That was taken as a kind of a clarion call to simply put these issues in a box and not talk about them, not ever recognize them, not gather data around race anymore. So, there are many different ways that this idea of colorblindness has shown up in public policy. The reality, though, is when you go into a criminal courtroom in San Francisco, I\u2019ve had a friend of mine who teaches juvenile justice and has a clinic for helping law students go in and represent young juveniles who are threatened with conviction. She\u2019s relayed to me how her students have come to her with these sad stories of young black or brown juvenile who\u2019s entering into those courtrooms in San Francisco. And there\u2019s one story, in particular, stands out for me where the young juvenile entering the system leans over to their student representative, law student, who\u2019s trying to develop a way of dealing with the system trying to support this young person. The juvenile leans over and says: where\u2019s the court for white kids? Because all the kids in the system around them are brown or black. And they know white kids are getting in trouble and doing the same kind of stuff, but they\u2019re not in here. So, that\u2019s the way in which we\u2019ve tended to mute our conversation. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t see or understand or perceive the world around race, we\u2019ve just silenced ourselves around it. And that is what colorblindness is really meant, color inability, that kind of awkwardness, inability to talk about it, not that we don\u2019t see it. So, there\u2019s that. There is a way in which that term doesn\u2019t actually track reality. And there is also a bit of a kind of a critical response to the use of colorblind because, the disability rights community, for example, has pointed out that there\u2019s a way in which there is already an ignorance, if you will, around the capacities of people who are not sighted, and we don\u2019t want to use blindness to associate it with this other kind of ignorance. There are many ways that people have said, let\u2019s really look at this language colorblind. In fact, what we\u2019re talking about is color evasion, denial of the reality of these aspects of our lives. An enforced awkwardness, an enforced silencing. And, for me, the alternative really is to develop our capacities to actually effectively address these issues. I have used the word, the phrase color insight to point to the way in which, again our groundedness in mindfulness and compassion practices, and in the capacity to just sit in silence for some periods of our lives, moments of the day, moments of an interaction, and try and really develop a sense of insight: what is going on here? The metaphor of insight, if you will, is something that I think is important to be brought to bear as a counterpoint to blindness, if you will, that we have been you know raised up within the last generation. In fact, what we\u2019re talking about is color evasion, denial of the reality of these aspects of our lives. An enforced awkwardness, an enforced silencing. And, for me, the alternative is to develop our capacities to actually effectively address these issues. Barry Boyce: So, how does that tie into mindfulness? How can mindfulness practices help cultivate this kind of insight\u2014The ability to see difference and yet begin to transcend, in some sense. Rhonda Magee: Well, again go back to my own way of thinking from mindfulness, which is not just as short-term very personal self-improvement intervention. It is it is about having a regular daily commitment to a kind of practice that is about awakening and awareness, in a very deep way, that is ongoing for one\u2019s life. If mindfulness is about really cultivating the capacity to be present to reality, to this moment, but to see it as embedded in a kind of context, then mindfulness is, I think, a way of being with this part of reality in a more profound way. And so it\u2019s seeing mindfulness, first of all, in this richer deeper way. It\u2019s not limited to these personal daily practices for clarifying the mind for productivity. It is those things, and then deepening our capacity to see the interconnectedness of all. The way in which my being able to sit for five 10 20 30 minutes a day is tied to a certain kind of structure of convenience that is not open to everybody. So, in other words, there are ways that our practices can really enhance and open up our capacity to see interconnection everywhere and our capacity to be with suffering on a long-term basis. And these are the kinds of insights and skills that are essential to this work of dismantling, on a long-term basis, the patterns that lead to bias and oppression. Barry Boyce: So to the extent that the somewhat over popularized view of mindfulness, and it\u2019s great that mindfulness is becoming popular, but there is a kind of a dominant mainstream cultural vibe that\u2019s developing that associates it with kind of escaping, it\u2019s just time out. But you\u2019re suggesting that it very much also needs to be time in, where you really now, you know, you have the capacity to look with less fear and more openness. And I think that does tie back to, you know, your semester where, if you do that in community you get a little bit of a bravery from peers to doing it. Don McCown, who teaches mindfulness in Philadelphia, is very much of the mind that mindfulness is a group practice, and mindfulness-based interventions are done in groups and people have opportunities in those structures to reveal themselves in very important ways. You and I both know Cheryl Petty, we\u2019ve been to a conference together with Cheryl down in Virginia, and, I\u2019m paraphrasing something that Sheryl said, folks who know equity work deeply, who know about the deep historically embedded sources of systemic bias and racism, such you\u2019ve been talking about, they don\u2019t tend to know much about mindfulness. Rhonda Magee: It\u2019s true. Barry Boyce: It hasn\u2019t infiltrated that academic community all that much, or the activist community all that much. And by the same token, people who know mindfulness deeply don\u2019t know much about deep historical ingrained tendencies and might have a tendency to overlook those kinds of things and think that, well you\u2019re just aware and kind then everything is going to be fine\u2014I\u2019m doing anything racist right now I\u2019m just meditating. Rhonda Magee: Right. Barry Boyce: Cheryl was suggesting these two need to get together somehow. Rhonda Magee: Absolutely. Cheryl and I are very much on the same page about this. I think Cheryl\u2019s insight there is right on. It is absolutely true. Again, part and parcel of the way our society isolates, silos, we kind of get into our line of discourse and we often fail to see some of the ways that we need to connect with others. Our mindfulness discourse over here does need to find its way into a conversation with social justice activists, people who are trying to change the world, and vice versa\u2014That social justice discourse actually needs to kind of infuse, get connected up, be a part of the mindfulness movement. This is, again, where patience is essential, even though we want this change to happen right now. It\u2019s not easy. I speak from the position of one who has been seeking to bring these two discourses and communities of practice together for 20 years\u2014 maybe 10 years explicitly, 20 years implicitly. But I\u2019ve been doing this work for long enough to see, it\u2019s really hard. And it\u2019s hard for reasons that are totally predictable. I completely understand why, if you\u2019ve been raised in a world of social justice activism, you may not have come across mindfulness and these other ways of being with our conditioned habits and practice in reactivity. That might not have been a part of how you got into social justice activism. And similarly, I completely understand how being brought into Western mindfulness may not have come through the door of social justice activism and awareness around those things. I get it. But when you really get it you start to see, with some compassion, that if we\u2019re going to make a difference around these things we have to refine what we\u2019re doing, deepen our capacity to reach out even in the most difficult places, and stay in connection despite the frustration that will inevitably arise when we feel like we\u2019re not moving fast enough. So, I think Cheryl\u2019s comment is really spot on. And I can imagine a world where, a generation or two from now, we are teaching social justice, as has begun to be the case not only in my class but in other classes. Beth Barilla is teaching anti-oppression work around gender, and so on, through the lens of mindfulness and compassion. Others around the country are starting to do this. I can imagine our children might be invited into classes that both heighten their awareness of social injustice and what it means to fight against oppression. But also are supported with some kind of practices, whether we call them mindfulness or otherwise. And similarly, I can see training for mindfulness teachers, in fact I know that\u2019s also starting to happen, but I can imagine a generation from now that we when we train teachers in mindfulness, part of that training is a rich deep look at who that teacher is in terms of their own conditionings around these social identity issues, of race, of gender, of immigration status, of disability, of class. The way in which mindfulness teachers are trained right, ultimately, I think, needs to be infused with this understanding as well. If we\u2019re going to make a difference around these things we have to refine what we\u2019re doing, deepen our capacity to reach out even in the most difficult places, and stay in connection despite the frustration that will inevitably arise when we feel like we\u2019re not moving fast enough. Barry Boyce: You know, I think, in this conversation that the three of us were having, I\u2019m remembering a practical example that came up, and this reminds me of something you said earlier about people having the time and luxury to meditate . Somebody was talking about a program for social activism where there was a mindfulness-based program and there was total silence at all the meals. And it was an artificial imposition of a structure that was not inviting. And we have to examine all the assumptions about what we think is absolutely required to make a certain kind of mindfulness space or retreat. Rhonda Magee: I think that\u2019s absolutely true. And that, again, we don\u2019t do overnight and we don\u2019t accomplish with a workshop. These are deep patterns of change. This is what structural change looks like, to start to say: what are the assumptions about what we need to do for this to be about mindfulness that might actually be off-putting to many of the people we would want to feel at home here. And, you know, so there are people like Ed Ng who\u2019s a cultural heritage Buddhist who has been actually criticizing some of what the Western mindfulness movement has brought to bear. And one of the lines of critique that he\u2019s made that I think is worthy of amplification is, how it is that we have tended not to look at closely enough that how some of the traditions from which mindfulness emerged, Buddhism as its practiced, include not just sitting meditation and sitting in silence and those kinds of trainings that we associate with preparation for being a monk or of the kind of deep immersion that has been identified in western mindfulness as what mindfulness means, the sitting practice. It\u2019s very important, but, if you listen to heritage Buddhists, people who have come from cultures which have been infused with these practices for a very long time, they talk about the work of coming together, shelling peas together, cutting and preparing the food for a meal together, sitting together in a way that is infused with the fact that we are in a human community together. So, it can be partly in silence, of course, but also infused with loving connection. So that again would take me back to the kind of community I grew up in, where it wasn\u2019t about what we called mindfulness, or it wasn\u2019t from a Buddhist tradition certainly, but we really were embedded in a sense that we were, we held hands, for example, when we got together. It was very common that when we would come together at some point there would be actual physical contact, which, again, for people whose backs are up against wall, which, I would say in a certain sense, all humankind is feeling this sense of bereftness of what it means to be embedded in loving community. Being able to actually, you know, in appropriate ways, reach out and connect, and again, we need social psychology and neurobiology to affirm this, it\u2019s doing so, right, the research is confirming the importance of just human touch. And so, there is a lot of different ways that we could, as you say, examine the assumptions we bring and then it could show up in different things that we do come here in mindfulness gatherings. Barry Boyce: You know, it\u2019s interesting, in terms of Buddhism and mindfulness, you know there\u2019s a way in which, in it coming to the west, lots of parts of the bigger spectrum of Buddhism have been stripped away. At the same time there\u2019s also a way in which Buddhists can also be kind of reactionary almost, in feeling that Buddhism possesses mindfulness. But mindfulness is actually a basic human trait and there are many traditions that have cultivated mindfulness. I think we need to work at that from both ends. Speaking from the point of view of a magazine and a website that\u2019s committed to cultivating mindfulness and mind training and in public context where we know religion, per se, needs to be, let\u2019s say, left at the door. But you know what doesn\u2019t need to be left at the door is sacredness, community, and the fundamental values\u2014and I think that any pushing away of that, either for religious or secular reasons, is problematic. Rhonda Magee: I completely agree. And again, you\u2019re touching on the challenge. I do know that some people believe that we solve this by bringing Buddhism back in to mindfulness. But, again, that would be, in my view, a kind of oversimplification of what the challenge is. So we can both recognize these various different streams of Buddhism, and the various different manifestations of it, the cultural heritage piece of it that needs to be honored, and the diversity within and amongst all those things, without then saying that the answer to the challenges that we face in mindfulness, and in bringing in a sense of community and connectedness, is to bring Buddhism fully back in. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we need. I do think though, it means, as you say, really looking at what\u2019s the rich deep underlying set of values and ethical commitments that have been at the core of inner work, whether we call it Buddhism or Christianity, whatever it is, Islam. There are core ethical and, I would say, values-based commitments that have a certain set of things in common. I think when you and I met at that retreat so many years ago, I think, part of the purpose of that was to try to look at what is in common across all these different traditions. And so that is a conversation I am always up for. I do think, again, it\u2019s another way into this conversation about dealing with difference while recognizing sameness all at once. Barry Boyce: You know, I think that that relates a bit to the colorblindness thing in the sense that roots matter. There\u2019s a good tradition that\u2019s developing in Canada now that at most public gatherings of some kind, well certainly many, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s most, there will be a statement at the beginning respecting that we are on Aboriginal land. There is a, you know, quality just that little bit of indication at the beginning that kind of transforms your thinking. If I think about your grandmother, her roots are a big part of who she is and if you just say, well everybody\u2019s kind of basically the same. We all shop at the Piggly Wiggly. You know, you have to listen to somebody\u2019s deep roots. Rhonda Magee: Yes. I\u2019ve certainly been mindful of some of the wisdom that\u2019s coming out of the Canadian context. But just this idea, certainly, of honoring groups and honoring lineage and also, again, you know, being able to deal with the good, the bad, and the ugly that comes with looking at our lineage. Not sugar-coating it, but to really recognize that, first of all, we all have some lineage. As we deepen our capacity to honor where we have come from and how we end up here together, we enrich who we are from that. We strengthen our capacity to go forward with broken-heartedness and with joy. Right? All of that is going to come up when we really get more real about who we are. I honestly feel that is really a kind of a potential gift and benefit of mindfulness that we haven\u2019t quite figured out how to talk about\u2014quite figured out how to see or live our way into\u2014but it\u2019s this ability to be real. As we deepen our capacity to honor where we have come from and how we end up here together, we enrich who we are from that. We strengthen our capacity to go forward with broken-heartedness and with joy. Barry Boyce: I think that\u2019s quite beautiful, you know, that if you look at roots and lineages you have to look at the really bad parts, too. Our roots are part of who we are, they are not all of who we are. Rhonda Magee: Exactly. Barry Boyce: You know, it reminds me of the fact that that you are a triple University of Virginia grad. Rhonda Magee: Yes, I am. Barry Boyce: A fine institution, that has a beautiful thing there called the Contemplative Science Center, founded by Thomas Jefferson, a very high-minded person who was also a very aggressive slaveholder. Rhonda Magee: Yes. He did not found the Contemplative Sciences the Center, by the way, but the University of Virginia itself. Barry Boyce: Yes that\u2019s right. We should be clear on that. So, I\u2019m wondering how you must have felt as somebody who spent so much time at the University of Virginia and got so much from it, I imagine, when you saw what happened in Charlottesville, I mean, how did that feel for you? Rhonda Magee: Thank you for asking. It was devastating, really, because the images that were shown all around the world brought me right back to those physical locations. I spent eight years in Charlottesville undergraduate law and graduate sociology. But eight years in that community and so every step of the march that the tiki torch carriers did, that\u2019s on ground I\u2019ve walked probably much more than most of the people carrying those torches. The statues around which they were circled, I literally stood by one of those statues when I first started trying to practice public speaking and gave a little speech out there. And the place where Heather Heyer was murdered, that street is one walked many times. I had a really close friend, a partner for a time, who had a job right on that same street, so we would literally walk those streets. So, for me, to see this place, that I knew very viscerally and personally as a source of community, be taken over in service of division, and to be a site for the fomentation of that kind of very ugly underbelly that is in our culture, but to see coming up there was really, really difficult. At the same time, it wasn\u2019t shocking, in the sense that, I have long known that this underbelly, this undercurrent of American culture has never gone away. So, despite the fact that I was trained like everybody else to sort of believe that we had moved into a world of colorblindness and post-racial this and that, you know, I grew up in a world which told me otherwise. Constantly being reminded of the different ways that race still mattered and that white supremacy and male supremacy were still desired in our country. I\u2019ve lived knowing that. So seeing that was painful but not totally surprising to me. Barry Boyce: So I just have a couple more questions. It\u2019s been it\u2019s been so wonderful, as it always is, to talk with you and I don\u2019t want it to end. But, all good things must come to an end. I just have a couple more things, though. When you\u2019re talking about white supremacy and male supremacy, I\u2019m reminded of the term intersectionality, meaning that biases don\u2019t come in singular packages, you can be at the intersection of several biases. Rhonda Magee: Yes indeed. Barry Boyce: But, intersectionality is also a complicated academic intellectual term. And part of the way that we make change is by examining and studying the world and coming up with new words and concepts and sharing those kinds of insights. And a lot of that happens in academia, but then, when it reaches beyond that, it\u2019s difficult language. Even if you have academic training, you might not have academic training in that particular discipline, so it becomes very hard to follow. I mean, I find it a very interesting challenge because I\u2019m not saying in any way at all that these disciplines and languages are not important and extremely helpful, but, how do you work with that? Because you are an academic, and you are an activist as well, and a teacher. Rhonda Magee: Another great question. It\u2019s a very present issue, this question of how to talk about what we\u2019re talking about in ways that bring people into the conversation and don\u2019t push them away. It\u2019s a feature of life in academia that we do develop these terms that are what we are using in our little world. And then when we try to come out and communicate with others we can lose lots of people. This is a problem that all so-called elites are facing right now. That is to say, we haven\u2019t figured out, well enough, just how to communicate what it is that we see in the world beyond our little circle of concerned other parties who speak the same language. So, yeah, I sometimes don\u2019t use the word intersectionality\u2014even though I completely understand it and completely live it\u2014because I think it\u2019s not as well understood even by people who use it. It\u2019s a term that emerged to try and capture, as you pointed out, the reality that these patterns of othering\u2014So that\u2019s a word that I think people understand a little bit better\u2014And the experience of it, right, of being an \u201cother,\u201d being a person who doesn\u2019t really fit in and doesn\u2019t belong, or being a person who represents a group who has tended to be on the margin, if you will. Using the word othering and belonging, which is something that John Powell and others who do this work have been emphasizing, those are words that I think capture, as well, something about what it is that intersectionality is meant to capture, which is, the ways in which we are \u201cothered,\u201d or made to feel unwelcome, differ profoundly depending on our particular characteristics. So, it\u2019s going to be different for me as a black woman who came from a kind of a relatively poor background in terms of access to resources including education prior to my own generation, and all of that. There is a way in which being a black woman from a poor background, sort of positions me\u2014and I would say a poor background who\u2019s now moved beyond that, so now I\u2019ve seen the other side of the class divide in my own lifetime\u2014All of those are very unique aspects of positioning on a very dynamic social landscape. And if we only are talking about race, we\u2019re missing the way that gender is race or race is gender, right? So that, our experience of race has a gender dynamic to it that only others who are similarly situated really are kind of able to see in the same way. And even individuals who are all black and female, let\u2019s say, we\u2019re not experiencing the world exactly the same either. So, what begins to happen is we start to push on the vast oversimplification that runs with identity conversation. There\u2019s a lot of oversimplification that we\u2019ve just gotten used to. The idea that when we say Black woman we kind of know what that means, or when we say white male. I mean, actually, these are just beginning, they\u2019re just kind of surface, that might touch upon something that is an invitation, as far as I\u2019m concerned, into, what does that mean in this person\u2019s experience? What does it mean in mine? What does it mean in yours? But I think terms like intersectional are meant to try to push us in the direction of, not being so simplistic in the way that we think about these things, but we need better language because the language isn\u2019t there. Barry Boyce: Well, you make a very good point about how the intention behind having that word intersectionality is to undermine simplistic concepts that we assume have a solid meaning, a solid identity: Black women. White man. And, you can and you are finding ways to do that outside of the academic community, finding language, such as, simpler language like othering and belonging that can reach wider without, again, assuming that there\u2019s something wrong with the academic language. I want to end on one note because I would be remiss if before we left we didn\u2019t talk about your role as an educator of lawyers. Day in day out in your life you\u2019re educating lawyers who will go on and do things in the world. I\u2019d just like to end by hearing you say something about how your mindfulness work, and you\u2019ve already talked about your classes, but how your mindfulness work informs, could inform both how they practice Law, day in day out, and also the much larger notion of how justice is exercised in the world since, as Dr. King said, the arc of history is long but it inclines towards justice. So, what would you say about how mindfulness informs your role and in preparing our future lawyers? Rhonda Magee: Well, I do agree with this idea that the moral arc is long, but it bends toward justice. And I would add, it bends because people bend it towards justice. There is no inevitability towards that. I mean, that\u2019s just a fact. So, part of what I think mindfulness in law does\u00a0is help prepare students for the work of bending the moral arc of the universe toward justice. It\u2019s work. And being a lawyer gives one a particular position\u2014which is another kind of identity, location in the world\u2014it gives a person a particular role, potential role to play as an advocate, as a person who assists in bridging communities, right. There\u2019s a lot of different leadership and other roles that lawyers are invited to play. A lot of that, frankly, historically, has been about maintaining these unfair systems. And so the real challenge is to be part of the system, but not fully of it. Be enough a part of it to understand it, but also be a kind of a place in their system, a voice, a spirit, if you will, for a different way. I do agree with this idea that the moral arc is long, but it bends toward justice. And I would add, it bends because people bend it towards justice. There is no inevitability towards that. And so that shows up in teaching students a little bit more about how to listen to clients well, how to meet their suffering, because most people who come to a lawyer are in some form of distress or trying to avoid being in it, right. So there are concrete ways that we help lawyers by helping them listen, by helping them have emotional intelligence and empathy, I could say more about those concrete things. But, at the same time, really, those of us bringing mindfulness to law are seeking to bring a different view to a law that recognizes nuance more effectively, all the things we\u2019ve been talking about: sees paradoxic and can deal with \u201cboth and,\u201d a little bit more effectively, is aware that adversarial modes of resolving conflict are just one set of tools in the toolbox of an effective lawyer, but there are many other ways to help people resolve conflict and come together around some sort of issue of disconnect. So, it\u2019s a project that is about both helping expand the sense of what it means to be a knowledgeable and skillful and grounded person who can help others in the midst of conflict, and help us structure a world through law right. So, it\u2019s about expanding the skill set. But it\u2019s also about, really helping prepare a new generation of people in this profession who can help us bring about a world in which, to quote King again, right, he saw justice as what love looks like in public. Okay, so that\u2019s actually Cornel West, who\u2019s taken King\u2019s statement of justice as, justice for King was love, correcting that which stands against love. So, it\u2019s all about realizing that there is a role to play in bringing a kind of compassionate, caring, meeting of our struggle through our systems. And that that public face of love is what justice is all about. And so, that is what I\u2019m trying to do to, kind of, work with my law students. And what that looks like looks like one thing in my torts class, my personal injury class, one thing my race Law class, one thing and the retreat side for lawyers. But it is about creating a different way of being in this profession that I hope in a generation, in the years beyond my lifetime, will make it more of a source of loving public engagement with the challenges of life as opposed to just adversarialness. Barry Boyce: Well that\u2019s a beautiful point to end on, and it reminds me that we started earlier talking about mindfulness as being so much more than a personal improvement project, more than just relaxing and in what you have to say, and what you do, you really embody that. And this has been such an inspiring conversation and so great to spend this time with you and I\u2019m glad we can celebrate Mindful\u2019s fifth anniversary together like this. Rhonda Magee: Thank you so much, Barry. This has been a joy for me, too. And I\u2019m really grateful for the work that Mindful has been doing, that you\u2019ve been doing in the world. So, with great respect and honor for what you do. Barry Boyce: Thank you very much.

      "content_text": "A Meditation for Kids: Coming Back to the Positive What went well today? Kids and teens can explore this eight-minute guided meditation for noticing the positive. By Mark Bertin October 1, 2025 12 Minute Meditation Summary Children often focus on scary or unpleasant thoughts, which can effect their mental health. This short kids\u2019 meditation uses conscious breathing and happy thoughts to help them notice the good and feel more positive. Our brains are hardwired to notice the negative. It\u2019s part of how our ancient ancestors were able to survive in constantly threatening environments. But this negativity bias can also make it difficult for us and our kids, even in our comparatively less threatening environments, to navigate other daily stressors, like big tests, arguments, or disappointments. In this practice specifically designed for younger meditators , Dr. Mark Bertin shows kids how to gently guide their attention back to the positive things they might have missed, in order to help soothe the nervous system. A Meditation for Kids: Coming Back to the Positive Lie down somewhere comfortable . Let your arms and legs fall to the ground. Close your eyes gently. Start to notice how your body changes with each breath you take . Each time you breathe, your belly moves up, and your belly moves down. If it is easier, put a hand on your belly. Or if you want, put a stuffed animal there. Each time you breathe, your belly moves. Your hand, or your toy, rises, and then falls. See if you can count ten breaths that way. Breathing in, one , breathing out, one . (Repeat for nine more inhales, and nine more exhales.) When you lose count, don\u2019t worry about it. That\u2019s normal, and happens to everyone. Come back to whatever number you last remember. Now, shift your attention to your day . Breathing in, focus on your breath as your belly goes up. Breathing out, focus on something that went well today. With each breath: breathing in, noticing your belly move, and with each breath out, noticing something that went well today. Now, picture something about yourself that makes you proud . Breathing in, focus on your belly moving. Breathing out, picture something that makes you proud about yourself. If nothing comes to mind, that sometimes happens. If that\u2019s how you feel, picture what you\u2019d wish for yourself instead. Finally, bring someone to mind who makes you happy . Before we end, try one more practice. Breathing in, notice your belly move. And now, breathing out picture someone who makes you happy. As you come to the end of this practice , take a few deep breaths , and start to wiggle your arms and legs. Pause and decide what you\u2019d like to do next. It\u2019s normal to have thoughts that make us feel scared or bad. We should never ignore anything important, but it\u2019s useful to focus on the rest of our lives too. Take a few minutes every day to notice what has gone well, and see what happens next.",

      "content_text": "You Can Investigate Your Emotions Without Suppressing Them Founding editor Barry Boyce answers our questions about emotional intelligence, being kind to ourselves, and turning toward our emotions. By Barry Boyce September 29, 2025 Difficult Experiences & Emotions Satenik Guzhanina/Adobe Stock When presented with difficulty, a first reaction may be to ward off or ignore unpleasant emotions. It\u2019s normal. However, with practice, we can learn to lean on the comfort of safe spaces\u2014or meditation spaces\u2014to instead engage with them directly. One of the essential qualities of mindfulness is being with whatever comes up, rather than suppressing emotion or running away from inner challenges. In this short video, founding editor Barry Boyce answers our questions about emotional health and how we can turn toward our feelings. A Q&A with Mindful Founding Editor Barry Boyce How to Let Go of Suppressing Our Emotions Q: If we let\u00a0ourselves feel our emotions, one concern may be that we won\u2019t be able to stop feeling them. If we\u2019ve avoided our emotions for a long time, will it be too much to handle? What would you recommend? A: The fear that our emotions will overtake us and rule our lives (or at least a significant chunk of our time) is indeed one of the reasons we seek mindless distraction. Being kind to ourselves, repeatedly, is job one. Mindfulness practice is not about aggressively \u201ctackling\u201d our emotions in a fight to the death. If we\u2019ve been suppressing something for a long time and mindfulness begins to bring it up into our conscious awareness\u2014as it will\u2014the key instruction is to notice it and move on. When it comes up again, maybe seconds later, we do the same. This approach of a little bit at a time, moment by moment, reduces the emotional wallop by breaking it into momentary pieces, rather than treating it as one big permanent thing, which it is not. It never pays to push ourselves to the brink in the hopes of gaining freedom or insight. This is easy to say, but it does take a bit of ongoing gentle effort\u2014leavened with a lot of kindness toward ourselves\u2014to touch the emotion and let it go. Touch it, and let it go. If we are really overwhelmed and breaking down , we may need the help of a friend or a counselor. It never pays to push ourselves to the brink in the hopes of gaining freedom or insight. Easy does it. If you\u2019re wounded, attend to the wound, or get the help you need to heal. At some point, when we feel safer, we can explore our emotional landscape further, with the benefit of the repeated noticing we\u2019ve been doing. But that is more awareness and inquiry practice, as opposed to straight mindfulness. Coping Mechanisms and Suppressing Emotions Q: Sometimes ignoring our feelings can be a coping mechanism in stressful times. Can we suppress our feelings sometimes, but also open up to them the rest of the time? Is \u201cnot suppressing emotions\u201d an all-or-nothing deal? A: An excellent and delicate question. As noted above, first and foremost, it\u2019s vital to be kind to ourselves\u2014again and again and again. So, when emotions threaten to overwhelm us, we can respond to them with some form of \u201cYes, I know you\u2019re there, but now is not the time for me to go there.\u201d You may have to do that repeatedly. That kind of attitude doesn\u2019t mean you are suppressing or ignoring the emotion . You are, in fact, noticing it and acknowledging it. Touching it and moving on. That\u2019s mindfulness. When emotions threaten to overwhelm us, we can respond to them with some form of \u201cYes, I know you\u2019re there, but now is not the time for me to go there.\u201d When you notice it simply like that, you generally lessen its power to overwhelm you a bit. By contrast, suppressing\u2014actively, energetically pushing it down and away\u2014increases that power. Is Emotional Intelligence a Luxury? Q: For some, working on emotional intelligence seems impractical\u2014or a like luxury. What are some examples of ways we might use emotional intelligence in our daily lives? A: To appreciate why emotional intelligence might not be an impractical luxury, it will first help to define what we mean by \u201cemotional intelligence.\u201d According to the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, this notion first emerged when two emotion researchers, Peter Salovey and John Mayer, \u201clamented that theories of intelligence had no systematic place for emotions,\u201d which inspired them to articulate \u201ca theory that described a new kind of intelligence: the ability to recognize, understand, utilize, and regulate emotions effectively in everyday life.\u201d In a pivotal paper, published in 1990, they described this revolutionary idea, which they called \u201cemotional intelligence.\u201d The idea caught on, and Salovey and his laboratory at Yale became recognized leaders, pushing the field toward new discoveries and innovations. Five years later, Dan Goleman\u2019s book Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More than IQ , became a bestseller and popularized the idea further. When Google began its mindfulness program, Search Inside Yourself, in 2007, it emphasized emotional intelligence. In that respect, the program followed the belief that mindfulness and awareness practice as well as loving-kindness and compassion practices could enhance our emotional intelligence. When we have less ability to \u201crecognize, understand, utilize, and regulate emotions effectively in everyday life,\u201d it quite simply creates pain, for others and for ourselves. Finding ways to lessen pain is not impractical nor a luxury. It\u2019s the healthy thing to do. How do we find ways to use emotional intelligence in our daily lives? From a mindfulness perspective, the key habit that can help us cultivate more emotional intelligence is pausing, which lets the momentum of our emotions to be interrupted, so we have a moment to notice how they are showing up in our body and mind. As we do that more often\u2014a little bit of regular mindfulness practice helps develop the pausing habit\u2014the choices we make concerning how we express and act on our emotions may be more \u201cintelligent.\u201d When they\u2019re not so intelligent and we make a mess? We might notice that and learn from our encounter, rather than blindly stumbling toward wherever our emotions lead us. We featured the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence\u2019s assistant director, Dena Simmons, in the April 2019 issue of Mindful and on mindful.org . The center\u2019s director, Marc Brackett, recently released his book Permission to Feel: Unlocking the Power of Emotions to Help Our Kids, Ourselves, and Our Society Thrive , which is reviewed on mindful.org . Men and Emotional Well-Being Q: Men are often taught that crying (or showing nearly any emotion) is too feminine. What can we do to help change this ingrained idea, in ourselves and those around us? A: On a very simple level, when a man or boy seems on the verge of tears, we can very gently let them know that\u2019s it\u2019s fine to cry. A word or two or a nonverbal message can often be enough to convey that feeling without having to get too conceptual about it. Quiet listening and warmth go a long way in allowing someone to let their emotion simply be. At least you can respond without judging it as inappropriate. Changing gender stereotyping on a broader scale raises deep questions that go beyond the scope of personal mindfulness practice. The ways children are socialized and taught what gender means has been explored extensively by many people and form the basis of a variety of programs aimed at social change. One of the most interesting is The Representation Project, started by Jennifer Seibel Newsom (who is married to the current governor of California). Her film Miss Representation concerns how girls are taught to think about gender in limiting ways, while The Mask You Live In \u201cfollows boys and young men as they struggle to stay true to themselves while negotiating America\u2019s narrow definition of masculinity,\u201d according The Representation Project website. Newsome\u2019s most recent film, The Great American Lie , focuses on a social addiction to a certain definition of masculine values, which are held up as superior to those identified as feminine. Newsome has presented on these issues several times at the Wisdom 2.0 conference. The Mask You Live In features the work of Ashanti Branch , who is one of the featured teachers in Mindful\u2019s Mindful30 challenge. These films can be screened by school groups and others interested in gender education. read more Mental Health The Real Danger of Suppressing Your Emotions A key element of emotional intelligence is the way you regulate your difficult emotions\u2014But not all emotional regulation techniques are created equal.

      "content_text": "Mindful Marble Art: A Creative & Sensory Practice for Kids This marble-painting activity activates all the senses and lets you enjoy a mindful moment while making art with your little ones. By Rose Felix Cratsley September 26, 2025 Kids and Teens Adobe Stock | Pixel-Shot Mindfulness isn\u2019t just about stillness\u2014it can be a playful, swirling, and colorful experience. Mindful marble art transforms a simple creative activity into a sensory-rich moment of presence, helping children slow down, focus, and express themselves. Through gentle movement, breath awareness, and sensory exploration, this practice fosters patience, emotional regulation, and creativity\u2014all while making art! See what it can look like. The sensation of rolling marbles, the vibrant blending of colors, and the rhythmic tilting of the tray help little ones engage their senses and cultivate mindful awareness. Benefits of Making Mindful Marble Art Encourages patience : Children practice slowing down and guiding movement with care. Engages the senses : Touch, sight, and motion deepen awareness of the present moment. Strengthens breath-body connection : Pairing breath with movement supports self-regulation . Fosters creativity & self-expression : Encourages open-ended exploration and focus. What You\u2019ll Need A shallow tray or box (a baking pan or shoebox lid works well) A sheet of paper (cut to fit inside the tray) Non-toxic, washable paint in 2-3 colors Marbles or small rolling objects (ping pong balls, beads, or crumpled foil work too!) A damp cloth or wipes for easy cleanup How to Do Mindful Marble Art 1. Set the Space Begin by creating a calm and inviting atmosphere. Place materials in front of you and your child. Before starting, take a deep breath together: Breathe in slowly through your nose (as if smelling a flower). Exhale gently through your mouth (as if blowing out a candle). Repeat this breath 2-3 times. Ask your child, \u201cHow do you feel right now?\u201d 2. Sensory Preparation Invite your child to explore the marbles before painting: What do they feel like? Smooth? Cool? Round? Can you roll them between your fingers without dropping them? Dip a marble into the paint and ask: What does the paint feel like? Sticky? Slippery? Gooey? What colors do you see? Are they mixing together? 3. Rolling with Awareness Place the marbles onto the paper in the tray. Guide your child to hold the edges, feeling its weight. Encourage mindful movement : As they tilt the tray forward\u2014breathe in. As they tilt it back\u2014breathe out. Mindful questions to keep attention focused: What happens when you move the tray fast? What about slow? Do the marbles ever get \u2018stuck\u2019? What can we do to help them move? How do the colors mix together? If attention drifts, take a pause-and-wiggle break, shaking out hands before resuming. 4. Reflect and Appreciate Once finished, pause to admire the marble art. Ask: What do you see in the patterns? (Clouds? Rivers? Something new?) How did it feel to roll the marbles? End with a gratitude moment together. Place a hand on your heart and say, Thank you for this time to create and play.",
