      "content_text": "When people ask me about meditation, they often say, \u201cRinpoche, I want to meditate, but my emotions get in the way.\u201d I always tell them: emotions are not obstacles to meditation. They are the very path. The Buddha himself discovered this. As a prince, he had everything \u2014 a palace, wealth, comfort \u2014 but he was still dissatisfied. He asked, Everything is going well. Why am I still not satisfied? Where does all this suffering come from? Later, after years of study and austere practice, he sat under the Bodhi tree and remembered a childhood moment under a rose apple tree. As a boy, simply resting in presence, he had felt a natural ease: nothing to get rid of, nothing to create, just awareness as it is. That memory opened the door to enlightenment. In the Vajrayana tradition, we say that our true nature is already pure and complete. But when we forget this, emotions like anger, jealousy, and pride cloud the mind. The good news is that these emotions themselves can lead us back to our true nature. In fact, there are three main ways to work with emotions: removing, transforming, and transcending. Watch Mingyur Rinpoche\u2019s companion video for this article. Removing: Creating the Right Conditions The first way is very practical: we learn to avoid or reduce the conditions that stir up strong emotions. In early Buddhist teachings, this is called the removing or abandoning style. Imagine you\u2019re meditating and keep falling asleep. One simple method is to stand up, walk around, or open a window. Doing this will \u201cremove\u201d the sleepiness. Another version of this approach is to remove the conditions that trigger a reaction. If you\u2019re distracted by your smartphone at bedtime, put it in another room. Here again, you\u2019ve removed distraction, the unwholesome state of mind. These adjustments are not yet deep wisdom \u2014 they are like changing the outer conditions so the mind can settle. Sometimes people think this is not \u201creal meditation,\u201d but it is very important. The Buddha himself taught many precepts to help us avoid harmful environments and behaviors. When emotions are strong, it can be wise to step back, breathe, and change the situation. Practice: The Removing Method Next time you feel overwhelmed by sleepiness, anger, or craving, don\u2019t force yourself to \u201cfix\u201d it with meditation. Instead, change one condition: move your body, adjust your posture, take a short walk, or shift your focus. Notice how small changes can reduce the power of an emotion. The removing style is like taking the thorns out of your shoes before walking. You don\u2019t have to carry the pain unnecessarily. Transforming: Turning Poison into Medicine The second way is subtler and more powerful. In Vajrayana, we say, \u201cPoison becomes medicine.\u201d Instead of pushing emotions away, we bring them onto the path. For example, take ignorance. When the mind feels foggy, confused, or dull, it can be frustrating. But ignorance also has a good quality \u2014 it is non-judgmental. When you rest with that quality, it becomes openness, the wisdom of vast space. Or take anger. Anger can be painful and destructive, but within anger there is also energy, clarity, and vividness. If you work with it skillfully, anger transforms into mirror-like wisdom. One of my favorite practices here is tonglen \u2014 taking and sending. When you feel anger, imagine breathing in the anger of all beings, dissolving it into your own. Then breathe out love, compassion, and joy to all beings. At first, this may sound frightening \u2014 \u201cRinpoche, I don\u2019t want more anger!\u201d \u2014 but what happens is the opposite. The anger itself becomes the source of compassion. The poison becomes medicine. Practice: Transforming with Tonglen Sit quietly and bring to mind a difficult emotion, like anger or fear. Breathe in, imagining that you take in the same suffering from all beings. Let it dissolve in your heart. Breathe out, sending love, compassion, and peace to yourself and everyone. Continue for a few minutes, letting the emotion soften into care. When we do this, emotions stop being enemies. They become teachers. They remind us of our shared humanity and open the door to compassion. Transcending: Seeing the True Nature The most profound method is to look directly into the emotion itself and recognize its nature. This is called transcending style. Knowing the nature of reality as it is. Normally, when anger or craving arises, we believe it is solid: I am angry. I am jealous. But if we look closely, what do we find? Anger is not one thing. It is made of many parts: a sensation in the chest, an image of the person who hurt us, some inner words, and a belief that, for instance, \u201cI was wronged.\u201d Put together, these parts feel like something solid, but when you look more closely, you see that it\u2019s not solid at all. It\u2019s just like shaving foam. It looks solid, but when you touch it, it dissolves! This is what the Buddha called emptiness. Emptiness is not nothingness. It points to the fact that things are not as real and solid as they often seem. The best solution to be totally free from suffering is recognizing emptiness. Just like in a dream, things appear vivid but are not truly real. You might dream of eating pizza: you see it, smell it, taste it, and even burn your tongue if it\u2019s too hot. Yet when you wake up, where is the pizza? It was vivid but empty. It was not as solid and real as it seemed in the dream. In the same way, when you look into an emotion, you see that it has no fixed essence. It appears, and yet it is empty. And within that emptiness is wisdom. Practice: Looking into Anger Bring to mind a recent moment of anger. Let it arise gently. Ask yourself: Where is the anger? In my chest, my head, my mind? Then ask: What is anger made of? Sensations? Images? Words? Beliefs? Notice how the pieces shift and dissolve. The solid anger cannot be found. Rest in the spacious awareness that remains \u2014 clear, open, and free. This is transcending: not following the emotion, not fighting it, but seeing its true nature. When we recognize this, emotion liberates itself, and what remains is the wisdom of that emotion. From Kleshas to Wisdom In Vajrayana, we speak of the five kleshas: ignorance, anger, pride, desire, and jealousy. These are usually seen as poisons, the roots of suffering. But each klesha also contains a seed of wisdom. Ignorance, when seen clearly, reveals the spacious wisdom of openness. Anger transforms into mirror-like wisdom. Pride becomes the wisdom of equality. Desire turns into discriminating wisdom, able to see the unique qualities of each being and thing. And jealousy ripens as all-accomplishing wisdom, the fearless energy to benefit others. With the methods of removing, transforming, and transcending, every emotion \u2014 no matter how painful \u2014 can become the doorway to its corresponding wisdom. The Three Together So which method is best \u2014 removing, transforming, or transcending? The answer is all of them. When emotions are overwhelming, start with removing. Create safe, supportive conditions. Once you are more stable, use transforming: turn the emotion into compassion and wisdom. And when the mind is ready, look directly into the emotion\u2019s essence and see its emptiness. In my own practice, I use all three methods, sometimes in a single meditation session. For example, if I feel sleepy, I may open the window (removing). If restlessness comes, I may do tonglen (transforming). And when clarity returns, I may look directly into the emotion (transcending). Emotions as Gateways When I was young, I suffered terrible panic attacks. I never believed I had buddha nature. But by working with my panic using these three styles, I came to see that emotions are not the problem. The problem is believing they are solid and permanent. Now, when I teach around the world, I tell people: Every time you blink your eyes, every breath you take, you are looking for happiness and freedom from suffering. That very longing is the sign of your buddha nature calling you home. So don\u2019t be discouraged by emotions. Anger, fear, jealousy, pride \u2014 each is a gateway. With skill, we can remove what is unhelpful, transform poison into medicine, and transcend by recognizing the luminous emptiness of mind. As the Buddha said after his awakening: \u201cProfound, peaceful, luminous, uncontrived.\u201d That nature is already within you. And emotions, when worked with skillfully, can reveal it.

      "content_text": "More than 250 Buddhist nuns from around the globe will receive bhikshuni ordination in Thimphu, Bhutan, from November 15\u201319. The ordination will be presided over by His Holiness the Je Khenpo, spiritual head of Bhutan\u2019s largest Buddhist school, the Drugpa Kagyu.\u00a0Since bhikshuni ordination\u2014the full ordination of nuns\u2014has traditionally been denied to women in the Vajrayana tradition, this marks a significant step toward addressing the inequality between men and women in monasticism. According to the vinaya , the Buddhist code of monastic discipline, bhikshuni ordination can only be conferred when both fully ordained monks and nuns are present. Because a Vajrayana bhikshuni lineage was never established, women have been shut out of full monasticism with a catch-22: Without a quorum of nuns to attend the ordination, no women can be fully ordained. Traditionally, women in the Vajrayana tradition can only ordain as novices, and no matter how long they live and practice as nuns, they are never considered anything other than novices. As a result, female monastics are frequently not accorded the same opportunities or status as their male counterparts, and they\u2019re prevented from assuming full roles within the monastic order. The first Vajrayana ceremony to grant bhikshuni vows in modern times took place in June, 2022. Like the upcoming ordination, it was also held in Bhutan and presided over by His Holiness the Je Khenpo, who described the 2022 ordination of 144 female monastics as aimed at \u201cserving sentient beings through the buddhadharma, engendering religious freedom and helping human rights.\u201d He added, \u201cwhenever I look at images of Buddha Shakyamuni these days, every one of them appears to be radiantly smiling at me, which I think is an early indication that what I am doing is not wrong. I have a strong conviction that they would announce, \u2018this is excellent!\u2019 and never say \u2018this is not right.\u2019\u201d The upcoming bhikshuni ordination will be the final segment of the inaugural Global Peace Prayer Festival, which\u00a0will be held in Thimphu, Bhutan, November 4\u201319, 2025. The festival welcomes dharma practitioners, teachers, and leaders from all Buddhist traditions and from all over the world. The festival will begin with the ritual of Jabzhi Dhoechog, which is rarely performed on such a grand scale. Then there will be two days of nonsectarian prayers from all sects of Vajrayana as well as other schools of Buddhism, followed by a mass mantra recitation, bringing people together in a shared aspiration for peace. The last segment of the festival before the bhikshuni ordination will be a Kalachakra initiation and empowerment. It will offer insights into the sacred interplay between the individual microcosm and the universal macrocosm, and the innate buddhanature and bliss present within all beings. As the Bhutanese lama His Eminence Laytshog Lopen explains, \u201cThe festival is dedicated to addressing the pressing challenges of our time \u2014 the hardships of famine, the disasters of the four elements, earthquakes, wars, and conflicts \u2014 that continue to cause insecurity and suffering across the world.\u201d You can read more about the Global Peace Prayer Festival here .

      "content_text": "As someone who\u2019s tended to gravitate towards practices, teachings, and teachers that have a grounded, direct, and honest approach to life, I\u2019m often inspired by recalling an exchange I once read between a meditation teacher and his sick disciple. As the disciple lay there terribly ill, he looked toward his teacher for reassuring words of comfort, only to have him say , \u201cYou\u2019ll either get better, or you\u2019ll die.\u201d The teacher had cut straight to the heart of the matter; essentially saying: This is what\u2019s true and I refuse to delude you into believing otherwise . Of course, the teacher knew his disciple well enough to know he could handle such a direct understanding, but I\u2019ve found that getting the occasional heavy dose of reality can wake us up, guide us toward an authentic way of relating to life, maximize well-being, and minimize suffering. If it weren\u2019t for the heavenly messengers \u2014 real-life visions of aging, sickness, and death, from which he\u2019d long been sheltered \u2014 shattering the Buddha-to-be\u2019s limited view of reality, he would\u2019ve never sought freedom, and we wouldn\u2019t have his teachings today. Sometimes all we need is a heavy dose of truth to help push us in a new direction and to find out what\u2019s truly important. Our views create our reality. How we choose to see the world determines how we live and act within it, and unfortunately more often than not our views are distorted and not in line with how things are. This gap between reality and our misperceptions of it can generate a lifetime of unnecessary suffering, stress, and sorrow. Take, for example, the view that we should be happy all the time; that life ought to always feel good. When we hold this view, we see happy moments as positive, successful, or as a sign telling us we\u2019re doing something right. Life is going according to our plan and we believe this is how it should always be. Likewise, when things are going bad, we feel like something is wrong, or that we\u2019re being punished. It can feel like the universe is out to get us and we suffer tremendously. But if we truly understood the truth of impermanence, and that life will inevitably have its pains and difficulties, then we\u2019d understand that sometimes we\u2019ll feel good, and sometimes not. We wouldn\u2019t have all the unnecessary suffering that comes with trying to hold onto the pleasant and pushing away the unpleasant. We could simply enjoy the good times when they arrive and learn to let them go when they change, as they surely will. We could also better endure the bad times, knowing that they too will pass. We could experience our lives, regardless of the flavor of the moment, just the way they are without getting thrown off balance or being limited by our conditioned reactions. When we see life as it is, we see that it\u2019s impossible to find freedom and peace if we\u2019re caught up in a wrong view. We also understand that how we view things affects every part of our lives, so by shifting our views we can directly affect not only how we feel, but more importantly how we choose to live. When our views don\u2019t match reality, it can be like banging our heads against the wall \u2014 hoping things were otherwise, while wondering why our heads hurt so much. I\u2019m reminded of my favorite secular explanation of the Buddha\u2019s Four Noble Truths: Shit happens; We make it worse; We don\u2019t have to; There\u2019s a path not to. Coincidentally, the Buddhist \u201cpath not to,\u201d aka the Eightfold Path, also begins with committing to Wise, or Right, Views. Let\u2019s start with the first view: Freedom and change ARE possible. The good news this view offers is that, yes, you can change. Modern neuroscience has proven that you can alter the neural makeup of your brain by how you pay attention and respond to what\u2019s arising. This is called neuroplasticity . Put simply: the way you relate to your life moment-by-moment matters, and where you find yourself today is simply the result of what you\u2019ve been doing up until this point. Just like with anything in life, what you practice at and do repeatedly, often you get better at. What might you have been practicing? Letting go? Patience? Worry? Aversion? Anxiety? Addictive craving? Freedom and change ARE possible, and if you don\u2019t believe that, you will likely find yourself stuck with the same patterns, behaviors, and ways of being that led you to be stuck. It\u2019s an unwise, or wrong, view. But once you believe that it\u2019s possible to change, you\u2019ve already planted the seed to make it happen; you\u2019ve allowed that possibility to become a reality. So if you don\u2019t like the results you\u2019re getting with how you\u2019re currently living, then maybe that\u2019s a cue to start doing things differently. Or as one Buddhist lojong , or \u201cmind training,\u201d slogan puts it, Don\u2019t be so predictable! So if freedom and change are possible, why do most of us continue to stay stuck? Why aren\u2019t we all practicing ways of being that lead to peace and well-being? The answer is our conditioned, unconscious, deeply ingrained behavior patterns, many of which developed during childhood. As children we learned how to be in the world through our relationships with our parents and siblings. We also quickly figured out which emotions were preferred or allowed and which ones weren\u2019t, dissociating from what wasn\u2019t tolerated and clinging to and maintaining what was. We also created habits to avoid or keep us safe from feelings and situations that might have been too overwhelming for us. These habits, which typically are modes of escaping our lives, become solidified early on and become who we think we are. (Key word: think .) Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck used to call it \u201cthe substitute life.\u201d An example of these patterns of the substitute life could be seeking attention due to an older sibling getting more attention than you, or a persistent yearning for approval due to highly critical parents. Or it could be the result of trauma and loss, or a manifestation of other unmet needs. Regardless of what causes them, we all have patterns we act out (or better put, that act us out) unconsciously and that cause us to react in familiar, predictable ways and which become especially prevalent when we encounter discomfort. These behaviors usually end up defining who we think we are and become the lens through which we see the world. They may have served a purpose in the past or kept us safe at some point, but even if we\u2019ve outgrown them, we can cling to them out of desperation and familiarity. The view that freedom and change are possible reminds us that we needn\u2019t limit ourselves to this conditioning, and can instead, with wisdom, practice, and understanding, respond freely and appropriately to the present circumstances. Jack Kornfield often says, \u201cSuffering is not the end of the story,\u201d and he\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t have to be. There\u2019s a freedom that\u2019s available right now that we can rest in. From that place of freedom, we can reprogram how we meet our lives. Our unwholesome patterns, difficult feelings, and limiting storylines don\u2019t have to define us. They are our substitute life and aren\u2019t who we really are. But you need to experience this truth for yourself. The good news is you\u2019re already free right now to see this. You don\u2019t have to complete ten years of therapy or do thousands of hours of meditation to become free. You may be thinking it can\u2019t be that easy. How could I possibly change after years and years of conditioning? I don\u2019t feel free at all! Try this simple exercise: Take a moment to pause. Close your eyes and simply notice what\u2019s going on in your mind. See if it\u2019s calm or busy, focused or restless, wandering in the past or future or present with the experience of the moment. Notice how effortless it is for you to be aware of what\u2019s happening in your mind. As thoughts arise, give them a label and let them be. If a worried thought arises simply label it, \u201ca worried thought.\u201d If your mind is completely restless just say to yourself, \u201cA restless mind is like this.\u201d Honestly label every thought as it arises and observe them all as they come and go. Watch the flow of thoughts in this way for a few minutes. Then, open your eyes. This short exercise shows that awareness is possible right now. And if we can be aware of our awareness, then we know we always have a choice: to either follow our thoughts, emotions, or moods \u2014 or let them go and respond differently. The ability to change habits of mind is a great tool and learning to let go of unhelpful states while cultivating helpful ones is a large part of this view. And it\u2019s possible to take this view of freedom to an even deeper level. Rather than merely changing our unskillful habits we can use this view to begin uprooting their very causes so they no longer arise. To understand this level of freedom we need to gain a wise view of our sense of self. The \u201cThree Marks of Existence\u201d In Buddhism, not understanding who we are is called ignorance, denoting an innocent misunderstanding of reality and mistaken sense of identity: that we have a solid, separate self. Helpful in comprehending all this is the Buddhist notion of the \u201cthree marks of existence.\u201d These three marks are the basic characteristics shared by every single thing in the entire universe. They are: Anicca , or impermanence Dukkha , often translated as suffering but perhaps best understood here as a pervasive sense of unsatisfactoriness Anatta , or non-self, also known as interdependence Together, these offer us a skillful way to see through the delusions of ignorance; a strategy to release grasping which ultimately reduces our suffering. Let\u2019s explore them. The first mark of existence is the truth of impermanence \u2014\u00a0 an obvious truth of life, and central to Buddhist thought. In the Dhammapada the Buddha says, \u201cBetter it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.\u201d As the saying goes, the only unchanging law in the universe is that everything changes. Understanding the fluid, flowing nature of reality can not only help us loosen our grip but can also give us deeper insights into the nature of self. When asked the question, Who are you?, most of us would identify with our bodies, emotions, and the content of our minds. But is this true? When we really investigate it, we see that everything that we take to be \u201cwho we are\u201d is constantly changing. Yet we talk about ourselves as if it weren\u2019t. We tend to grab on to these fleeting experiences of life, taking them personally and labeling them as \u201cme\u201d or \u201cmine\u201d \u2014 without really looking to see if that\u2019s the case. Yet, all day long there are sensations, thoughts, moods, emotions, sights, sounds, tastes, and smells arising and falling away. If these were \u201cwho you truly were,\u201d wouldn\u2019t you disappear when they did? (How many thoughts, emotions, desires, sensations, and moods have you experienced in your life? How many have lasted ?) You may be wondering how this understanding leads to freedom. As we begin to understand our impermanence, and our ignorance, we can bring more ease to the suffering of life. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been caught in frustration over something or someone, and just the simple reminder that this is an impersonal, impermanent reaction helps me relax into the situation and respond more appropriately and skillfully. More often than not, I\u2019m able to be with any aversion or rage until things cool down, which they always do. This ability to stay with what is, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, and realize that the experience is not as solid, personal, and unchanging as may seem, is what leads us to freedom. It allows us to soften into the moment and rest in an inner spaciousness that can hold the experience until it changes. It can be difficult. Sometimes it can feel as if you are sitting in the center of a raging fire. But as T.S. Eliot once said, we are \u201c to be redeemed from fire by fire.\u201d Or to quote Jack Kornfield again: \u201cGo ahead, light your candles and burn your incense and ring your bells and call out to God, but watch out, because God will come and He will put you on His anvil and fire up His forge and beat you and beat you until He turns brass into pure gold.\u201d By simply pausing and seeing your reactivity as \u201cnot-me\u201d or \u201cnot-mine\u201d as the Buddha instructed his followers, you begin to experience what it\u2019s like to step out of me-world into a vast spaciousness of freedom. Me-world thrives on wanting things to work out a certain way. Our reactivity is literally the mind, rooted in this illusion of a solid self, trying to have things go its own way. But the Buddha offered a different path, one free from the grips of ignorance and reactivity, and the good news is, you too, can experience this freedom. The second mark of existence, dukkha , is typically understood as \u201csuffering.\u201d But again, it might better to think of it as dissatisfaction. Because all things are impermanent, nothing is reliable; there are no guarantees and nothing in this world can ever truly satisfy or fulfill us. If we try to grasp on to that which is ungraspable, suffering follows. We could spend our whole lives trying to maintain certain situations or feelings, or hoping our friends and partners stay exactly the same, but it will be to no avail. All these will change. But through understanding the impermanent, unreliable nature of things we\u2019re cultivating a wiser relationship to how life actually is. When happiness comes, we\u2019re able to fully embrace and enjoy it, and we\u2019re able to let it go and embrace and appreciate the next moment, regardless of its flavor. The third and final mark of existence, no-self , can be a most complex teaching, and quite transformative as you realize it more and more deeply. I think what\u2019s most important to understand with this mark of existence is that suffering and reactivity are rooted in our sense of self, and if we\u2019re able to see the content of our body and mind without any self behind them \u2014 \u201cnot-me\u201d or \u201cnot-mine\u201d \u2014 we will grasp less and less at them, in turn reducing the cause of our suffering. As said above, I relate to this mark of existence as less of a metaphysical truth about reality and more of a practice in letting go. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t exist, but rather, we don\u2019t exist the way we think we do, and when we hold on to the changing content of our experience \u2014 that which is impersonal and impermanent \u2014 we suffer more. Rather than \u201cno-self,\u201d I often translate this mark of existence as \u201cinterdependence.\u201d In other words, our sense of self is a bunch of different causes and conditions constantly interacting and changing. Our idea of who we are is made up of interdependent elements that aren\u2019t really us at all. There\u2019s nothing (including us) in the universe that exists independently on its own. A single blade of grass may, for example, seem to. But, upon real investigation we see that it needs soil, nutrients, water, a planet with an atmosphere, a sun to bring it light and warmth, and on and on and on. You and I are no different than that blade of grass. Everything that makes up who we think we are: body, feelings, thoughts, emotions, etc., are all conditioned and are dependent on other conditions (each having their own causes and conditions) to exist. Through our meditation practice our minds get more and more still, and this assists us in having deep experiences of our interconnected nature. As we become more aware of the true nature of our experience and see for ourselves how grasping causes suffering, we begin to see that who we think we are is a very convincing illusion, and how this hewing to our misunderstandings of reality makes our life so much more painful and difficult. All This is About Your Freedom Freedom isn\u2019t some distant prize after years of Buddhist practice. It exists here and now, right in the middle of the messiness of everyday life. We could even say that freedom is who we \u2014 you! \u2014 already are at the deepest level. We can change our lives because of this freedom \u2014 as long as we\u2019re willing to pay attention and willing to rest and live from this place of freedom. Can we \u2014 Can you? Can I? \u2014 be courageous enough to open to life exactly as it is, and use that as a place of practice? Countless meditators before us prove that we can. I wish you well on your journey.

      "content_text": "Take the time to eat an orange in mindfulness. If you eat an orange in forgetfulness, caught in your anxiety and sorrow, the orange is not really there. But if you bring your mind and body together to produce true presence, you can see that the orange is a miracle. Peel the orange. Smell the fruit. See the orange blossoms in the orange, and the rain and the sun that have gone through the orange blossoms. The orange tree that has taken several months to bring this wonder to you. Put a section in your mouth, close your mouth mindfully, and with mindfulness feel the juice coming out of the orange. Taste the sweetness. Do you have the time to do so? If you think you don\u2019t have time to eat an orange like this, what are you using that time for? Are you using your time to worry or using your time to live? Spiritual practice is not just sitting and meditating. Practice is looking, thinking, touching, drinking, eating, and talking. Every act, every breath, and every step can be practice and can help us to become more ourselves. The quality of our practice depends on its energy of mindfulness and concentration. I define mindfulness as the practice of being fully present and alive, body and mind united. Mindfulness is the energy that helps us to know what is going on in the present moment. I drink water and I know that I am drinking the water. Drinking the water is what is happening. Mindfulness brings concentration. When we drink water mindfully, we concentrate on drinking. If we are concentrated, life is deep, and we have more joy and stability. We can drive mindfully, we can cut carrots mindfully, we can shower mindfully. When we do things this way, concentration grows. When concentration grows, we gain insight into our lives. Oneness of body and mind is the fruit of practice that you can get right away\u2014you don\u2019t have to wait. When I join my palms to greet a child, or to greet an adult, I don\u2019t do it simply to be polite. I do it because this is my practice. I am a living being who is bowing to a child or to a friend. Joining my palms, I make a flower. It\u2019s beautiful in appearance and it\u2019s beautiful on the inside. In joining my two palms, I realize the oneness of body and mind. My left hand is like my body, my right hand is like my mind. They come together, and in an instant I arrive at the state of oneness of body and mind. When mind and body come together, they produce our true presence. We become fully alive. Oneness of body and mind is the fruit of practice that you can get right away\u2014you don\u2019t have to wait. The principle of the practice is simple: to bring our minds back to our bodies, to produce our true presence, and to become fully alive. Everything is happening under the light of mindfulness. In the Jewish and Christian traditions, we say, \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything in the presence of God.\u201d That\u2019s another way of expressing the same reality. When Jews have a shabbos dinner, they lay the table, pour the milk, and cook the food aware of the presence of the divine. In Buddhism, God is mindfulness and concentration. Every single thing that takes place is exposed to the light of mindfulness and concentration, and that energy of mindfulness and concentration is the essence of the Buddha. Mindfulness and concentration always bring insight, and insight is the factor that liberates us from suffering, because we are able to see the true nature of reality. All rituals are nothing if they are empty of the energy of mindfulness and concentration. We could call these energies the Holy Spirit. When a priest celebrates the Eucharist, breaking the bread and pouring the wine, it\u2019s not the gesture and the words that create the miracle of the Eucharist. It\u2019s the priest\u2019s capacity to be alive, to be present at that moment, that can wake up the whole congregation. The priest can break the bread in such a way that everyone becomes aware that this piece of bread contains life. That requires strong practice on the part of the priest. If he\u2019s not alive, if he\u2019s not present, if he doesn\u2019t have the power of mindfulness and concentration, he won\u2019t be able to create life in the congregation, and in the church. That is why empty rituals don\u2019t mean anything. For all of us\u2014priest, monk, and layperson\u2014our practice is to generate the energy of concentration and mindfulness. When we do something deeply and authentically, it becomes a real ritual. When we pick up a glass of water and drink it, if we\u2019re truly concentrated in the act of drinking, it is a ritual. When we walk with all our being, investing one hundred percent of ourselves into making a step, mindfulness and concentration become a reality. That step generates the energy of mindfulness and concentration that makes life possible, deep, and real. If we make a second step like that, we maintain that concentration. Walking like that, it looks like we are performing a rite. But in fact we\u2019re not performing; we\u2019re just living deeply every moment of our lives. Even a daily habit like eating breakfast, when done as a practice, can be powerful. It generates the energy of mindfulness and concentration that makes life authentic. When we prepare breakfast, it can also be a practice. We can be really alive, fully present, and very happy during breakfast-making. We can see making breakfast as mundane work or as a privilege\u2014it just depends on our way of looking. The cold water is available. The hot water is available. The soap is available. The kettle is available. The fire is available. The food is available. Everything is there to make our happiness a possibility. If we are caught in our worries and anger, or in the past or the future, then, although we\u2019re making breakfast, we\u2019re not there. We\u2019re not alive. You can clean the toilet in the spirit of mindfulness, investing all of yourself into the cleaning, making it into a joyful practice. If you are cutting carrots, you should invest one hundred percent of yourself into the business of carrot-cutting. Nothing else. While cutting the carrot, please don\u2019t try to think of the Buddha or anything else. Just cut the carrot in the best way possible, becoming one with the carrot, becoming one with the cutting. Live deeply that moment of carrot-cutting. It is as important as the practice of sitting meditation. It is as important as giving or hearing a dharma talk. When you cut the carrot with all of your being, that is mindfulness. If you can cultivate concentration, and if you can get the insight you need to liberate yourself from suffering, that is because you know how to cut your carrots. You can clean the toilet in the spirit of mindfulness, investing all of yourself into the cleaning, making it into a joyful practice. Do one thing at a time. Do it deeply. There are many wonders of life that are available in the here and the now. Without mindfulness, you may be angry that you have to clean the toilet or feel resentful, and neglect and ignore the wonders around you. Many of us don\u2019t allow ourselves to be relaxed. Why do we always try to run and run, even while having our breakfast, while having our lunch, while walking, while sitting? There\u2019s something pushing and pulling us all the time. We make ourselves busy in the hopes of having happiness in the future. In the sutra \u201cKnowing the Better Way to Live Alone,\u201d the Buddha said clearly, \u201cDon\u2019t get caught in the past, because the past is gone. Don\u2019t get upset about the future, because the future is not yet here. There is only one moment for you to be alive, and that is the present moment. Go back to the present moment and live this moment deeply, and you\u2019ll be free.\u201d How do we liberate ourselves in order to really be in the here and the now? Buddhist meditation offers the practice of stopping. Stopping is very important, because we\u2019ve been running all our lives, and also in our previous lives. Our ancestors, our grandfather, our grandmother were running, and now they continue to run in us. If we don\u2019t practice, our children will carry us in them and continue to run in the future. A practitioner has the right to suffer, but a practitioner does not have the right not to practice. People who are not practitioners allow their pain, sorrow, and anguish to overwhelm them, and to push them to say and do things they don\u2019t want to do and say. We who consider ourselves to be practitioners have the right to suffer like everyone else. It\u2019s OK to suffer; it\u2019s OK to be angry. We can learn to stop and stay with our suffering, attend to it with all of our tenderness and kindness, and take good care of our suffering. Let\u2019s try not to run away. We run because we\u2019re too afraid. But if we can be present with our suffering, the energy of mindfulness is strong enough to embrace and recognize that pain and that sorrow. We suffer because we lack insight into our nature and into the nature of reality. The energy of mindfulness contains the energy of concentration, and concentration always contains the capacity of seeing deeply and bringing insight. To see deeply, we have to first learn the art of stopping. The Buddha is often portrayed as sitting on a lotus flower, very fresh, very stable. If we\u2019re capable of sitting in the here and the now, anywhere we sit becomes a lotus flower\u2014whether that is at the base of a tree, on the grass, or on a stone bench. When we\u2019re really sitting, we\u2019re free from all worries, from all regrets, from all anger. Many of us sit on the meditation cushion, but it\u2019s like sitting on thorns because we don\u2019t know how to enjoy the lotus flower. You can start by just appreciating your eyes. Breathing in, you are aware of your eyes; breathing out, you smile to your eyes. When you embrace your eyes with your mindfulness, you recognize that you have eyes, still in good condition. It is a wonderful thing to still have eyes in good condition. You need only to open them to enter the paradise of colors and forms. Those who have lost our eyesight know what it feels like to live in the dark and wonder at the capacity to see things. When we cook, when we clean, when we walk, each movement can be made with mindfulness, concentration, and insight. With each step we take, we can touch the earth and become one with it. Our fear and loneliness dissipate. We can just sit on the grass and open our eyes. The beautiful sunrise, the full moon, the orange, all these things reveal themselves to us when we are truly present. The blue sky is for us. The white clouds are for us, as are the trees, the children, the grass, and the loving faces of our dear ones. Everything is available to us because we still have eyes in good condition. Most of us don\u2019t appreciate our eyes because we are not mindful. We may think that everything in us is wrong, but that\u2019s not true. There are millions of things in us that are right. When we cook, when we clean, when we walk, each movement can be made with mindfulness, concentration, and insight. With each step we take, we can touch the earth and become one with it. Our fear and loneliness dissipate. There is no other way. With every breath, we can generate mindfulness, concentration, and insight. Insight is our liberation. Insight liberates us from our fear, our ignorance, our loneliness and despair. It is this insight that helps us to penetrate deeply into the nature of no-birth and no-death, and the interconnected nature of all things. This is the cream of Buddhist practice\u2014and we can do it by means of the very simple practices of breathing in and breathing out, being mindful of each step, and looking deeply. Thich Nhat Hanh Thich Nhat Hanh (1926-2022) was a renowned Zen teacher and poet, the founder of the Engaged Buddhist movement, and the founder of nine monastic communities, including Plum Village Monastery in France. He was also the author of At Home in the World , The Other Shore , and more than a hundred other books that have sold millions of copies worldwide.",

      "content_text": "In a centuries-old temple in Kyoto, American artist Taiji Terasaki installed his latest work, Wings Over Crystalline Landscapes . In his artist\u2019s statement, Terasaki describes the exhibition as exploring \u201cthe quiet, luminous intersections between butterfly migration, mineral formation, and human contemplation. Installed at Ryosokuin Temple\u2014a site steeped in Zen practice\u2014this body of work invites viewers into a layered meditation on time, impermanence, and interconnectedness through painting, sculpture and augmented reality.\u201d The exhibition is intimate and grand at the same time. Most of the pieces are no bigger than 12X12 inches, yet the themes they touch on feel vast. Crystals\u2014the main medium of the pieces\u2014 usually take millions of years to form. Terasaki and his team, however, managed to grow them in a single day. They began experimenting with chemical processes in March 2025 and launched the fully realized show by late summer. The speed of development is remarkable, but, as in Zen practice, when the causes and conditions align, anything is possible. The idea for the project began when Toryo Ito, vice abbot of Ryosokuin, visited Terasaki in Honolulu. He invited Terasaki to create a site-specific piece for the temple and spoke about the declining population of chestnut tiger butterflies, whose numbers are dropping due to numerous factors such as climate change and habitat disruption. Terasaki at Ryosokuin Temple, where his exhibition explored the intersections of art, science, and mindfulness through themes such as migration and ecological restoration. At the time, Terasaki was curious about working with crystals as a source of paint. Crushed crystals have been used in this way for thousands of years, including the brilliant blues of ancient Egyptian tombs having been made from lapis lazuli. Terasaki had also visited Sedona, Arizona, a place known for its fascination, even celebration, of crystals as a spiritual tool. A pivotal moment came during a Zoom call with Toryo Ito. On screen, the vice abbot wore a mala, or prayer beads, made of crystals. Though he did not ascribe spiritual meaning to the mala\u2019s material, the image sparked Terasaki\u2019s imagination for the exhibition. If crystals didn\u2019t necessarily impress the vice abbot, the process of making them did. Creating the crystals required absolute stillness and silence\u2014any vibration or sound would disrupt their fragile formation. Vice abbot Ito likened this process to Buddhist practice: \u201cMinerals slowly regain their order in environments that maintain stillness and stability. Even slight vibrations or fluctuations in temperature can unravel their fragile and intricate bonds. Zen meditation is much the same. Distracted thoughts gradually settle through the stability of breath and awareness, until the mind eventually takes on a form of harmony. In silence, both crystals and the mind return to an unseen order.\u201d The Terasaki Legacy Taiji Terasaki is a third-generation Japanese American. \u201cMy grandparents and my parents were incarcerated in camps,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were part of that generation, but they did good for themselves.\u201d Taiji Terasaki\u2019s father was Dr. Paul Terasaki. As a child, Paul Terasaki shared one room with five other family members while incarcerated at Gila River Internment Camp in Arizona. In the 1950s, Paul Terasaki went on to become a pioneer in organ transplantation. Today, Los Angeles is home to two institutions bearing the Terasaki name: the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation and the Terasaki Budokan, a recreational center in Little Tokyo. While the Terasaki family is filled with scientists, Taiji Terasaki found his path through art. Even though he doesn\u2019t consider himself a scientist, he does enjoy research. And his work reflects a STEAM sensibility\u2014integrating science, technology, engineering, art, and math (as opposed to the more commonly lauded field of STEM). Even when discussing his process, he slips into a bit of scientific lingo: \u201cI like that the crystals are inorganic material, and the butterfly is organic,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd [crystals are] below the earth\u2019s crust, and the butterfly is flying above.\u201d At Ryosokuin Temple in Kyoto, Japan, Terasaki\u2019s art was integrated into the temple\u2019s shoji screen doors. His art uses the sciences, particularly the environmental sciences and technology, to explore themes of the show. Part of the fascination of the exhibition is the use of \u201caugmented reality\u201d to make the exhibition come alive. While patrons can enjoy the exhibition on its own, they have the option of using mini iPads; when held up to the art pieces, the iPads illustrate butterflies fluttering across the Asian landscape. During the opening of the show, a trio of Gen-Z patrons\u2014a group raised on screens and immersive technology\u2014were delighted to see the small butterflies fly across the crystalline canvases. The augmented reality elevates the traditional gallery experience. The Plight of the Butterfly Across cultures, butterflies have long symbolized transformation. Chestnut tiger butterflies make their trek throughout Asia, from Japan to Taiwan, China, and eventually Vietnam. Sadly, like so many other butterfly populations, their numbers are in decline. In the United States, butterfly numbers have dropped by 22 percent. Beyond their beauty, butterflies play vital ecological roles. They are pollinators and a food source for other animals, from birds to monkeys. The chestnut tiger, in particular, pollinates the fujibakama flower, a culturally significant plant in Japan that appears in classical art and literature, including Lady Murasaki\u2019s The Tale of Genji , often cited as the world\u2019s first novel. In his research, Taiji Terasaki investigated the migratory path of the chestnut tiger butterflies. They fly over lands rich with quartz crystals and a variation of other stones. These stones are mined and used in a variety of ways, from improving the aesthetic quality of jewelry, to being used as spiritual healing tools, to improving technology. (Ever wonder why a Quartz watch is so precise? A tiny quartz crystal helps power the watch.) It\u2019s unclear whether the mining of these stones adds to the habitat destruction affecting the population of chestnut tiger butterflies, but the exhibition raises this important question. Practice & Symbolism Taiji Terasaki\u2019s personal spiritual path began in a Methodist church in West Los Angeles. \u201c But when I graduated, I became part of the sangha in downtown LA at the Zen Buddhist center there,\u201d says Terasaki. \u201cI took it pretty seriously for a while.\u201d His Buddhist practice isn\u2019t what it once was, but it has continued to inform his world view. These days, he also incorporates Ayurvedic practices, focusing on diet, yoga, and meditation\u2014and continues to learn about crystals and the possibilities they may hold. In certain Buddhist communities, crystals and other rocks hold meaning. Malas can be made from an array of crystals, from clear quartz to tiger\u2019s-eye. A Tibetan prayer wheel can have inlaid turquoise or coral. There are whole Buddhist statues made from jade. Buddhist texts refer metaphorically to the \u201ctriple gem\u201d (Buddha, dharma, and sangha) and of course, there\u2019s the Diamond Sutra . While rock references are present in Buddhism, some Buddhist communities see the use of crystals\u2014often popularized by Western New Age spirituality\u2014as antithetical to the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Vice abbot Ito is clear on the matter: jewels and gems in Buddhist texts serve as metaphorical symbols for \u201cthe truth Buddha found that is pure and genuine.\u201d In that spirit, Wings Over Crystalline Landscapes invites us to see the world with a new lens, to meditate on the impermanence of the earth and its creatures, of what we might lose or gain. It is a call to action\u2014right action\u2014to mindfully attend to the fate of butterflies, flowers, and all other living beings on the planet.

      "content_text": "This post is sponsored content, paid for by Drala Mountain Center. From Tibet to the West, the Dharma has taken root. Its next chapter is ours to write. The story of one practitioner illustrates this moment. After retiring from a demanding corporate career in 2023, Robbie Rettmer undertook a pilgrimage to Mount Kailash in Tibet. What she encountered there among the monasteries and mountains was the indestructibility of the Dharma and the fragility of a culture under restriction. The trip marked a turning point in her spiritual journey. Soon after, she was called into service as Executive Director of Drala Mountain Center , another vulnerable yet vital seat of Buddhist practice. Robbie\u2019s experience reflects a larger truth: strengthening and protecting fragile wilderness lands dedicated to practice is itself part of writing the Dharma\u2019s next chapter in the West. The Passing of a Generation, the Demand on the Next Many of the great Buddhist teachers who first carried the teachings across continents have now passed: the 16th Karmapa, Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, and many others. To encounter an authentic teacher is always a blessing \u2014 to sit in their presence and receive direct transmission into the nature of mind is nothing short of extraordinary. Their gift was not only their words but their realization itself. The generation that followed trained under those great teachers. Teachers like 17 th Karmapa, Rabjam Rinpoche, Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Ringu Tulku Rinpoche, Mingyur Rinpoche, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, H.E. 2nd Kalu Rinpoche and others now carry their lineages while engaging dynamically with the modern West. In some sense, they are bicultural: deeply rooted in tradition yet fluent in our contemporary language and culture.\u00a0 They remain the vital bridge between East and West. And yet, the demand for their teachings has grown nearly impossible to meet. The highest transmissions \u2014 when a realized teacher directly reveals the nature of mind \u2014 are now rare treasures, calling for both protection and devotion. Increasingly, the responsibility for carrying the Dharma forward rests on communities of practitioners of the West. East to West, Unbroken Continuity Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa once said: \u201cThe lineage is like the pipeline and the yidams are like the water running through it. To secure the pipeline, it is important to relate to all the gurus in the lineage, not just one\u2019s personal guru.\u201d That continuity is what ensures the Dharma flows with integrity across time and culture. Western teachers now carry the Dharma through their training, study, and practice. Many have received abhishekas , transmissions, and instructions that authorize them to teach. They not only preserve its forms, but also translate its wisdom into the language of our own time, guiding parents, youth, and seekers from all walks of life who might otherwise never encounter these teachings. Still, it would be a serious miscalculation to assume Tibetan teachers are no longer needed. The way forward is a balance: Western teachers can point us toward the nature of mind, while Tibetan lineage holders reveal and embody it through their realization. Both are indispensable. One roots the teachings in our daily lives, the other safeguards their integrity through authentic transmission. Together, they ensure that the Dharma not only survives but thrives in the West. Patience Across Centuries The transmission of the Dharma to the West is still in its youthful years. It will take time, practice, and refinement for it to fully settle here. And, one day a Westerner may attain enlightenment in a way that shapes the tradition for generations to come. At Drala Mountain Center, founded by Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa and sustained by decades of practice, the Dharma has taken root. When retreatants gather on this land, the teachings live not as memories of the past but as experiences of the present \u2014 most often carried by committed Western teachers. Drala Mountain Center is a Rocky Mountain sanctuary for deep spiritual practice, transformation, and peace. Here, stillness reveals clarity, nature reflects our own brilliance, and ancient wisdom takes root in a modern world. Through meditation, community, and land stewardship, Drala Mountain Center serves to impact the world \u2014 one awakened heart at a time. Each of us has something to offer \u2014 through meditation, through kindness and compassion in our families and communities, through service and generosity that sustains our sanghas and centers. The future of the Dharma in the West will not rest with our meditation masters alone, but will survive and thrive through the work of courageous Western teachers and students willing to take the teachings to heart and make them real in the world where we live. The continuation of this lineage depends on all of us. Your presence, practice, and support sustain this vital refuge in the Rockies. Support Drala Mountain Center.

      "content_text": "Wanting to know where eggs came from, the five-year-old Jane Goodall ensconced herself for hours in a henhouse, oblivious to the fact that her family was worriedly looking for her. But the little girl didn\u2019t get scolded when she got home. Her mother saw how excited she was, so she simply listened to the details of the discovery. The years passed, and Goodall\u2019s passion and patience for observing wildlife only grew. In 1960, she began her study of chimpanzees and soon rocked the scientific community with what she learned: chimpanzees make and use tools. Prior to this, it was believed only humans had this skill. On hearing of Goodall\u2019s observation, the anthropologist and paleontologist Louis S.B. Leakey famously said: \u201cNow we must redefine tool, redefine Man, or accept chimpanzees as humans.\u201d Goodall went on to make further groundbreaking discoveries that helped solidify the evolutionary link between chimpanzees and humans. I spoke to her via phone when she was spending a rare day at her home in the United Kingdom. She talked about the compassion of animals, the power of trees, and what we can all do to effect positive change in the world. Andrea Miller: For decades, you\u2019ve championed wildlife and the environment. How do you maintain hope? My reason for hope is\u2014first of all\u2014my youth program, Roots and Shoots. This is the way I explain why it\u2019s called that: children are like plants. They start out as a tiny seed. Then wee roots and shoots appear. They\u2019re weak at first, but the power within the seed is so magical that the little roots reach water and the little shoots reach the sun. Eventually, they can push rocks aside and work through cracks in a brick wall. They can even knock a wall down. The rocks and the walls are the problems we\u2019ve inflicted on the planet\u2014environmental and social\u2014but roots and shoots surround the world. Plants can change the world; they can undo a spot of the damage we\u2019ve created. And young people are definitely going to change the world. As I travel around, I meet the youth. They\u2019re filled with hope and enthusiasm and innovative ideas, and that\u2019s very inspiring. Roots and Shoots is now in 132 countries. Secondly, my reason for hope is the resilience of nature. The places that we\u2019ve destroyed can become beautiful again. And then there\u2019s the human brain, which is utterly amazing. I think of the scientists who drilled down into the permafrost and brought up the remains of an Ice Age squirrel\u2019s nest. In the plant material, they found three living cells and from those living cells they managed to recreate the plant, which was a meadow\u2019s wheat. It\u2019s 32,000 years old, but it\u2019s now growing and seeding and reproducing. That\u2019s the resilience of nature, the incredible human brain, and the indomitable human spirit. Sometimes people say that something won\u2019t work, but there are other people\u2014like the scientists who recreated this Ice Age plant\u2014who don\u2019t give up. They overcome tremendous obstacles, and that\u2019s very inspiring. It gives me hope. In your book, Seeds of Hope , you talk about the reverence people tend to feel when they\u2019re with trees. Why do you think trees engender these feelings? They engender these feelings for me because\u2014rooted in the ground\u2014they can be so strong. They can withstand wind. They even withstand fire sometimes. It\u2019s difficult for me to stand by a tree with my hand on its bark and not feel that it has a spiritual value as well as a materialistic one. There is the whole symbolism of the roots going into the ground and finding water deep, deep down, and the leaves reaching up. There\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re purifying our air and removing the Co2. You use the word spiritual. How would you define spirituality? It\u2019s the opposite of being materialistic. Some people believe that everything is just there for its material value, or just as a thing. And then other people believe there\u2019s something more than that, which I happen to believe. I don\u2019t know if I can define spirituality\u2014I\u2019m not sure anybody really has\u2014but it\u2019s something that you either feel or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s an awareness of life that\u2019s more than just the physical presence. In your work as a primatologist and an ethologist, what anecdotal evidence have you discovered that demonstrates animals can feel compassion or love? I\u2019ll give you one story. There was an infant chimpanzee named Mel. He was three and should still have been riding on his mother\u2019s back, sleeping with her at night, and suckling. but his mother died. If he\u2019d had an older brother or sister, he would have been adopted by that individual, but he didn\u2019t, so he was on his own and we thought he\u2019d die. Then he was adopted by Spindle, an unrelated male who was twelve, which is about like being a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old human. Spindle let little Mel ride on his back. If it was cold or Mel was frightened, he let him cling to his belly as a mother would. If Mel crept up to his nest at night and made whimpering sounds, Spindle reached out and drew him in. They slept curled up together. When Mel begged, whimpering with his hand out, Spindle would share his food. And most dramatic of all, Spindle protected Mel. Adolescent males tend to be scapegoats. If one male is being dominated by another, he takes it out on somebody lower ranking, so the adolescents keep out of the way in times of social excitement. And the mother\u2019s job is to keep her infant away, but of course, Little Mel didn\u2019t have a mother, so Spindle took that job on, even though it meant that he himself often got bashed by the adult male. There is no question that Spindle saved Mel\u2019s life. What do you see as the most important thing individuals can do to effect positive change for the environment? The most important thing we can do is remember that every single day every single one of us makes a difference. And we all can choose the kind of difference we\u2019re going to make. It does require becoming a little aware about what we buy. Where does it come from? how was it grown? Did it involve the use of child slave labor or chemical pesticides? And then there\u2019s all the little ways in which you interact with the environment. Do you bother to help a sick dog? Do you respond to appeals for help when somebody is in trouble? The big problem today is that so many people feel insignificant. They feel that the problems facing the world are so huge that there\u2019s nothing they can do, so they do nothing. And as an individual maybe there really isn\u2019t that much, but when you get thousands, and then millions, of individuals all doing the best they can every day for the environment and for other beings, then you get huge change. Can you give Lion\u2019s Roar readers some concrete examples of taking small steps to effect change? There\u2019s one man who moved to Japan, where he likes to walk in the woods. But sometimes there are violent storms and these little tiny tree orchids get blown down. Wanting to save them, he began taking the blown-down orchids home and looking after them. Now when the season is right, he gets as far up a tree as he can and staples them there with a stapler and they grow back. It\u2019s a simple thing, but it\u2019s rather charming. Another example, I went into a radio station in Canada and in the studio waiting room I saw there were about six potted plants dotted around. They were all dying because they hadn\u2019t been watered. So I made a huge thing about it. Then when I went back a year later, all the plants were very healthy. So little things like that make a difference. Just never blame somebody. I mean, I didn\u2019t say to the people at the radio station, \u201cWho\u2019s responsible for this monstrous behavior toward the plants?\u201d I just said, \u201cOh, these poor little plants. Please can you find me some water? I want to look after them.\u201d It\u2019s all a question of how you go about trying to create change.

      "content_text": "Tell us about your debut novel, Trip . How did this story come to you? I just was going to write about death. I wanted to write about something that I think is true, but write about it as fiction. Then there was this autism diagnosis in my family that crashed in and made the story be something else. I was trying to sort those two things out. Does the evolution of understanding of autism in the book reflect your own? The protagonist, Sandra, is still in the worst, early days of the diagnosis and really confused and aswim with it. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re there anymore as a family. Initially with autism, you think it\u2019s going to be chaos. But then, when you start to understand it, you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, I see what this is.\u201d We\u2019re more at an understanding place now, which I don\u2019t think Sandra really gets to. Trip takes place between two realms of existence. Were there specific ideas and teachings that you wanted to explore or learn about? Yeah, I wanted to orient myself in the world of the bardo of death. I tried to read enough, just so I felt confident enough to move the character around. I admire intellectuals like Robert Thurman, who really understand that material, but I was more just trying to be able to move the character around that world. Could you expand upon the idea of the bardo and its significance to you? At the beginning of every bardo teaching, they always say, \u201cBardo means in between.\u201d And I would always be like, \u201cYeah, yeah, get to the death part. Get to what I want to hear.\u201d It was only at the very end of writing the book, when I was checking some of Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche\u2019s quotes against a transcript, that I actually finally read and heard that part. And I was like, \u201c Oh. Okay, that\u2019s really something.\u201d I kind of was embarrassed that I had never heard it before. I think that\u2019s the most interesting part of the bardo. How has your Buddhist practice shaped you as a writer, and how did it come into play as you wrote Trip? Compared to writing You Are Having A Good Time , which featured your Plimpton Prize-winning short story \u201cWilliam Wei,\u201d was it a whole different beast? Yeah, that was different. Since having children, I don\u2019t have that much time to practice. Before I had children, I was more diligent, and you can see the difference in the voice. When I could really practice, sometimes I could catch myself thinking things that were useful for the story. Like in \u201cWilliam Wei,\u201d when he thinks \u201cthe thing about a dark truth is it is indistinguishable from doubt\u201d\u2014that was because I could catch those tiny thoughts. Early on, my practice helped me lose interest in some of my early childhood stories and shake those off. I think they were clogging things up a bit, because the memories weren\u2019t that clear, and I was hung up on that. Can you tell us more about the change in your voice since becoming a parent? It\u2019s so chaotic and different every time. I\u2019m like a hunted rat, just trying to find time to write a little. Whereas in the past, I could really be still and write carefully, so I wrote the way I wanted it to sound. Now, it\u2019s more beleaguered. Is there a positive side to that? I can do a lot more now. Like, with \u201cWilliam Wei\u201d I had to keep it very simple, so I could control it. Now I can handle more complexity. Can you tell us about your spiritual background and upbringing? My mom was a student of Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche\u2019s, and she ran the Shambhala Center in Houston, Texas. When I was nine or ten, it was in our house, so people would come and meditate there every Sunday. When my mom went to seminary, she brought me along. That was back when kids would just be running wild all day. So, I ran wild at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center [now called Drala Mountain Center]. Although I grew up in that atmosphere, in college, I stopped being a Buddhist for about a decade. Being around all these super intelligent, skeptical people, I got separated from it. Then Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche sent me this random email that snapped me back in\u2014he\u2019s my teacher. What was in the email? I had been in Hawaii, swimming all day. And I was like, \u201cI hate working at The Onion . I\u2019ve got to get out of there.\u201d I really wanted to write fiction and have a job, but I couldn\u2019t do both. I had to pick one or the other. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche wrote me an email saying, \u201cDo you want to come to India?\u201d So, I quit my job. So many people try to keep their religion or spirituality separate from their professional lives\u2014whether that\u2019s truly possible is up for debate\u2014but you haven\u2019t done that. Was that a deliberate choice? I hate talking about Buddhism\u2014I\u2019m really not that good at it. But then I end up writing about it for some reason. It\u2019s not really a decision. It just seems to happen. Amie Barrodale Amie Barrodale\u2019s debut novel Trip (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), begins with the sudden death of the protagonist. She tries to send a message to her son from beyond, but the mystics she hopes will help are distracted.",

      "content_text": "Question: I\u2019m overwhelmed. Things are stressful on the home front and no less stressful at work. With so much coming at me at once, it feels like I\u2019m drowning. I\u2019ve tried pretending things are okay, but that doesn\u2019t help. How can I cope? Kamilah Majied: It\u2019s a natural impulse to turn away from difficulties and try to make trouble go away by ignoring it. However, there is another option. We can turn toward difficulty with curiosity, even a sense of adventure, based on our desire to learn from suffering and grow. Granted, family problems, health problems, work problems, and such do not feel like interesting adventures when we encounter them. But it is precisely because they feel threatening that they are worthy of investigation. Often a problem at home or at work isn\u2019t just troubling because of the surface issue that the problem is about. It\u2019s what the problem makes us feel and think about ourselves that is disturbing. Taking the time to examine those feelings and thoughts using our meditative practices often shows us that we have some internal hook by which the external challenge has grabbed us. \u201cI am growing stronger and wiser as I navigate challenges like these.\u201d Next time you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, try to surface the feelings your situation is bringing up for you and consider whether you are making factual connections. For example, if your partner says he\u2019s feeling unhappy in the relationship, does your fear of abandonment from childhood have to get glommed onto this situation? Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy practices such as contemplative writing, positive self-talk, and affirmations help us approach problems from a relaxed, nonclinging, optimistic, and growth oriented attitude. Try answering this self-exploratory journal question: \u201cWhat is the difference between the actual problem posed by my situation and my perception of and feelings about my situation?\u201d Be aware that you have resources that could help you grow from your current difficulties. To help you focus on them, you can use this prompt for positive inner dialogue: \u201cI am still okay despite this problem because\u2026\u201d Finally, consider using this affirmation or something similar: \u201cI am growing stronger and wiser as I navigate challenges like these.\u201d Doing these practices reiteratively helps us maintain a positive outlook in tough times.
