      "content_text": "Ideas Rivers of Dharma: Buddhism on the Khorat Plateau Scholar Stephen A. Murphy\u2019s latest book shines a light on the archaeology of Buddhism in northeast Thailand from the 7th to 11th centuries. By Nicolas Revire Oct 17, 2025 The Kul\u0101vaka-j\u0101taka on a fragmentary s\u012bm\u0101 from Muang Fa Daed, 8th to 9th centuries, sandstone. | National Museum Khon Kaen, Thailand. Courtesy Thierry Ollivier/National University of Singapore Press. Buddhism\u2019s history is often told through the grand monuments of great capitals and the famous pilgrimage sites that shaped its development across Asia. Yet some of the most intriguing chapters unfold far from these urban and much traversed centers. Such is the case in rural northeast Thailand\u2019s Khorat Plateau, where winding rivers carve through the landscape, carrying with them not only water but also currents of faith, art, and community. This vivid world is described by Stephen A. Murphy in Buddhist Landscapes: Art and Archaeology of the Khorat Plateau, 7th to 11th Centuries (NUS, 2024). Drawing on nearly two decades of meticulous fieldwork, analysis, and interpretation, Murphy challenges conventional narratives that confine Buddhism\u2019s vitality to imperial centers or established hubs of devotion. Instead, he reveals a richly textured monastic culture that flourished in the late first millennium across the river valleys and upland settlements of the Khorat Plateau\u2014regions long overlooked by scholars and the public alike. Buddhist Landscapes: Art and Archaeology of the Khorat Plateau, 7th to 11th Centuries By Stephen A. Murphy The University of Chicago \u00a9 2024, 288 pages, 95 color plates, 15 maps, 11 tables, $56.00, hardcover The author\u2019s focus on the Khorat Plateau stems from a deep interest in the interplay of art, archaeology, and religion in shaping lived Buddhist experience. Rather than viewing sacred sites and artworks as isolated relics, he situates them within the environmental and social contexts that gave rise to and sustained them. At the core of this approach is a recognition that Buddhism in the Khorat Plateau was not a static, uniform tradition but a dynamic tapestry woven from multiple Buddhist streams, local innovation, and shifting political realities. The Khorat Plateau occupies much of present-day northeast Thailand, bounded by the Mekong River to the north and east and the Dong Phaya Yen and Phetchabun mountain ranges to the west. Often perceived as peripheral to Thailand\u2019s political and cultural centers, the region nonetheless played a pivotal role in the transmission and localization of Buddhism between the 7th and 11th centuries. Its river systems linked distant communities, facilitating the movement of people, goods, and ideas across the broader Mekong world. The Plateau emerges in Murphy\u2019s study as a vital crossroads where diverse Buddhist traditions took root and evolved within distinct ecological and social settings. Rivers as Waterways and Buddhist Pathways One of the book\u2019s most incisive frameworks is its organization around the three principal river systems of the region\u2014the Chi, the Mun, and the Middle Mekong. These rivers are not mere geographic features but central actors in the story. They functioned as arteries of movement, exchange, and communication, linking disparate communities and facilitating the flow of religious ideas, artistic styles, and political influences.

The Chi River system, for example, is home to the remarkable Mueang Fa Daet site, in Kalasin province, which Murphy interprets through the lens of the mandala\u2014a concept often understood as a symbolic cosmogram but here used to illuminate the lived sacred geography of a Buddhist community. Mueang Fa Daet emerges as a vibrant religious center with workshops producing intricate and large boundary sema stones. These stones\u2014carved markers for monastic sacred precincts often illustrated with scenes from the Buddha\u2019s life or his previous births\u2014embody a distinctive local Mon style that simultaneously reflects and diverges from better-known pre-Angkorian and Dvaravati models from neighboring Cambodia and central Thailand. This site exemplifies how local communities actively shaped Buddhist practice and artistic expression, embedding religious meaning in their environment and daily life.

Here, the narrative complicates simple stories of cultural imposition or dominance. Instead, Murphy shows a nuanced exchange: Local artisans and patrons absorbed external influences selectively, adapting motifs and iconographies to fit indigenous tastes and devotional needs. This blending creates a distinctive regional style that challenges hierarchical views of cultural history and underscores the nature of Southeast Asia\u2019s religious past. Moving south and farther east, the Mun River basin and the Middle Mekong basin reflect the growing visibility of Khmer political power in the late first millennium CE. Yet this increasing influence did not erase local identities. Buddhist communities incorporated Khmer architectural and sculptural forms while maintaining continuity in ritual practice and belief. This highlights Buddhism\u2019s adaptability and its capacity to mediate shifting power relations while preserving spiritual meaning. The region also reveals a rich range of religious diversity and cultural connectivity. Murphy\u2019s study of temple ruins and inscriptions uncovers multicultural communities where Avalokiteshvara, a bodhisattva associated with Mahayana Buddhism, appears alongside Buddha images. Artifacts attest to wide-ranging connections reaching west to the Bay of Bengal and beyond, firmly situating the Khorat Plateau within an expansive cosmopolitan Buddhist world. This regional integration invites readers to rethink the plateau not as a peripheral backwater but as an active participant in broader networks of faith and exchange.

A Pluralistic Buddhist Landscape Central to Murphy\u2019s analysis is the theme of religious pluralism. The Khorat Plateau was probably not a monolithic Theravada stronghold but a place where multiple Buddhist streams coexisted and intersected. This pluralism emerges clearly through the study of sema stones, sculptures, and inscriptions. The boundary stones are especially telling. They do more than mark monastic limits; they function as canvases of devotional expression and iconographic innovation, incorporating diverse Buddhist themes. Their unique forms and carvings attest to local creativity and the negotiation of identity in a region at the crossroads of cultural currents. The concept of the mandala offers a powerful example of how Buddhist spatial and ritual organization articulated broader cosmological and social orders. The artistic and architectural developments at the sites provide a window into how religious meaning was embedded in community life and landscape. Negotiation continues in the broader regional interactions across the plateau. Rather than one culture imposing its norms on another, Murphy documents a complex dialogue between the Zhenla and later Angkor civilizations of ancient Cambodia, the Dvaravati culture of central Thailand, and local traditions. In the upper and lower Chi basin, artisans adapted external styles creatively, resulting in a vibrant regional aesthetic. Similarly, in the Mun River region, Khmer political dominance influenced religious art and architecture, but local Buddhist communities maintained their own ritual identities. The Middle Mekong basin adds linguistic and religious diversity to this picture, with Mon inscriptions revealing a multilingual society deeply enmeshed in transregional Buddhist networks. The book\u2019s final chapter emphasizes this dialogic process as a defining feature of the Khorat Plateau\u2019s Buddhist landscapes. The author argues that cultural exchange was never simply one-sided or coercive but involved negotiation, adaptation, and blending. Even the rise of important regional centers should be understood as reconfigurations rather than replacements of earlier local traditions.

Bringing the Past to Life through Visual Evidence Beyond text, Murphy\u2019s rich visual documentation plays an indispensable role in his argument. With more than one hundred illustrations\u2014including many intricately carved sema stones, detailed images of Buddhist sculptures, tables, and maps\u2014he invites readers into a direct encounter with the material traces of Buddhism on the Khorat Plateau. These images do more than support the narrative; they serve as evidence of a vibrant religious culture shaped by artisans, patrons, and communities. The maps, in particular, orient readers who may be unfamiliar with the geography of northeast Thailand, allowing them to trace the paths of rivers and the distribution of sacred sites that defined the spiritual landscape. This visual dimension is crucial to understanding the materiality of faith\u2014the way Buddhist ideas were made tangible in stone and metal, how sacred space was demarcated and experienced, and how communities inscribed their identities on the land. Future Directions and Remaining Questions While Murphy\u2019s work breaks important new ground, it also highlights areas ripe for further exploration. His focus is primarily on monastic and elite material culture, leaving the experiences of lay practitioners less visible. The everyday devotional lives of ordinary people\u2014how they engaged with temples, icons, and rituals\u2014remain a fertile field for future research. Another area for future inquiry is the relationship between Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions in the region. The author acknowledges the presence of Brahmanical imagery and rituals and one can even note instances of religious syncretism, but these themes are only lightly sketched. Given the close intertwining of Hindu and Buddhist iconography in many Southeast Asian contexts, a deeper exploration of these interconnections would further enrich our understanding of religious life on the Khorat Plateau. Additionally, while Murphy\u2019s use of the mandala model to explain political and religious organization is helpful, his application occasionally risks oversimplifying the diversity of local polities. The mandala framework\u2014adapted from Indic cosmological and political ideas\u2014has often been used in Southeast Asian studies to characterize fluid and overlapping spheres of influence rather than fixed territorial boundaries. Yet, in its original Buddhist and royal contexts, the mandala was anything but decentralized: It emphasized the central authority of the king or the Buddha at its core. A more critical engagement with these tensions might have opened space for alternative ways of understanding sovereignty and sacred space in the Khorat Plateau.

Despite these avenues for future inquiry, Buddhist Landscapes stands as a landmark achievement. It expands our understanding of early Southeast Asian Buddhism\u2019s geographic spread and internal diversity, revealing a world where faith was inseparable from landscape and local culture. This book invites readers to see Buddhism not as a fixed tradition rooted only in famous temples and capitals but as a dynamic, evolving religion shaped by communities living in complex environments. For readers seeking a deeper, more textured understanding of Buddhism\u2019s past beyond familiar narratives, Murphy\u2019s book offers a compelling journey into a lesser-known Buddhist world. Here, the rivers of the Khorat Plateau carry stories of devotion, artistic innovation, and cultural exchange\u2014reminding us that the dharma flows as surely as the waters that nourish the land.

      "content_text": "Teachings You Can Only Do What You Can Do A reflection and practice on generating loving-kindness and compassion when dealing with difficult people By Kimberly Brown Oct 16, 2025 Image by Roman Akhmerov When my mom checked herself out of the rehabilitation center again, I was ready to give up on her. For eighteen months she\u2019d been struggling with serious health problems\u2014emphysema, chronic kidney disease, exhaustion\u2014and had been rushed to the emergency room three times. Each time, doctors stabilized her and sent her to a short-term rehabilitation facility to regain her strength, but she refused to stay. After a few days, she\u2019d return home, resume drinking and smoking cigarettes, and within a month or two would need to return to the ER and start the whole process over again. It was painful to watch her suffer, and I was frustrated, angry, and desperate for her to listen to me, stay and let the medical team help her heal, and acknowledge that she needed help. I spoke with her doctors and close friends, and they all told me the same thing: There was nothing I could do. My mom was a mentally competent adult, legally able to make her own choices, even if they harmed her. People who cared about me saw how stressed and anxious I was, and urged me to stop trying to save her when she didn\u2019t want to save herself. I knew they were right\u2014partly. It was true that I couldn\u2019t make her do anything she didn\u2019t want to do, and pleading with her and getting mad at her was ineffective and upsetting both of us. But it was also important to me to approach my mom\u2019s struggles with wisdom, good sense, and kindness. As a Buddhist student, I knew there is always something you can do. And I knew that a truly compassionate person would never give up on anyone, even someone as difficult as my mom. People often say \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do\u201d because we believe that doing something has to mean taking a physical action that affects an outcome or makes a change. But in the Buddhist tradition, doing something includes thinking and speaking, as well as conduct; when you generate beneficial and nonharmful thoughts and communicate wisely and kindly, that\u2019s a type of action. So I began practicing loving-kindness and tonglen meditations for my mom. Loving-kindness, or metta , is a technique from the early Buddhist tradition of offering silent phrases of happiness and well-being to other people. Tonglen , or giving and taking, is a Tibetan compassion practice of breathing in (taking) another\u2019s suffering, and breathing out (giving) ease, healing, and peace. At first, it might not seem that these practices\u2014which happen entirely in the mind\u2014can possibly affect circumstances or other people. But if you look closely, you can see that\u2019s not true because our thoughts and intentions direct and inform everything we say and do. Though my meditations didn\u2019t miraculously change my mom\u2019s mind or heal her body, they affected me. When my attention shifted from my mom\u2019s behavior to the suffering that was driving it, I felt her fear and trauma and worry, and I understood that she was doing her best. She wanted to feel better, and drinking was the only way she knew how to do that. I noticed my anger soften and my heart open to her as I kept connected with her struggles, and I began to speak to her with less impatience and frustration. As I became gentler and more compassionate, my mom felt less defensive and alone, and I remembered something the teacher Thrangu Rinpoche said: Compassion and loving-kindness practice always works\u2014immediately or eventually. Sometimes these acts of kindness show results quickly and directly, as they did with my mom and me. In other situations, our loving efforts simply contribute to another\u2019s happiness sometime in the future, perhaps even in a future life. Even as I practiced, a part of me was still so exasperated with the situation that I was tempted to walk away and let her live however she chose without me. But I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that, because it didn\u2019t feel right to me, and also because I\u2019d taken the bodhisattva vow . When I did that, my Tibetan teacher explained that unlike other vows, such as the five lay vows (the five precepts), it\u2019s considered \u201cunbreakable.\u201d The precepts can be clearly violated\u2014if I tell my employer I\u2019m sick because I want a day off, I\u2019ve broken the vow against false speech and will need to renew it. But the bodhisattva vow is different. You don\u2019t break it by making mistakes or acting unskillfully, because your intention\u2014to benefit all beings\u2014remains intact. The vow is broken only if you completely give up on someone . If you believe, \u201cI hate this person so much that even if she was hit by a car in front of me, I wouldn\u2019t call an ambulance,\u201d or \u201cI would never help that person if he were suffering because he\u2019s a terrible man,\u201d or \u201cThey deserve to be miserable because they keep making terrible decisions,\u201d you\u2019ve abandoned the vow. The bodhisattva vow recognizes that all beings, even those who are dangerous and destructive, are struggling and suffering and deserve compassion and care. The bodhisattva vow recognizes that all beings, even those who are dangerous and destructive, are struggling and suffering and deserve compassion and care. This doesn\u2019t mean that we allow people to cause harm, because sometimes compassion means taking firm action, like standing up to an abusive boss. But we do so without hate or ill will , and without giving up on the possibility that they might change. I knew that I couldn\u2019t close my heart to my mom, not only because turning away would betray my vow but because it would feel terrible to shut down my own compassion\u2014to turn away from suffering rather than move toward it, even if it wasn\u2019t in my power to fix it. My mom continued to decline for a few more years, resisting medical advice until she died. She suffered a great deal, much of it unnecessarily, and, despite this, she didn\u2019t really change at all\u2014but I did. I continued my practice, and through my relationship with her, I discovered that it was actually harder to close my heart to her than it was to allow myself to accept her as she was, respect her choices, however unwise they were, and wish her to have peace and ease. I learned that staying vulnerable and openhearted is less painful than withdrawing and becoming hard-hearted. And today, when I feel helpless, I remember there is always something I can do, and you can too. Even if you can\u2019t stop a war or change an alcoholic family member, there\u2019s always still the possibility that you\u2019ll be able to do so in the future. So please\u2014keep paying attention, choose to cultivate goodwill and care, and develop your compassion and wisdom. Practice loving-kindness meditation and tonglen. Then, just like a bodhisattva, when it\u2019s possible to help, you\u2019ll be ready. Practice When I learned that bodhisattvas never give up, I felt exhausted, because it seemed to me that I had committed to doing something impossible. The idea that I could benefit all beings over countless lifetimes and help them awaken to our deep connection to each other seemed not only preposterous but an endless and futile endeavor that I could never fulfill. But then I realized that I wasn\u2019t doing it alone; I\u2019m actually doing it together with so many others, because there are lots of people in many traditions\u2014including you\u2014being bodhisattvas in their way and creating conditions of well-being for the world\u2014in the past, in the present, and in the future too. And if you\u2019re feeling tired or discouraged, or if you sense that your heart is closing to another person or to the world, it\u2019s OK to give yourself a moment to rest and have compassion for yourself. This practice will help you do this and to reconnect with yourself, with your beautiful nature, and help you remember your vast intention and recommit to your bodhisattva vow to benefit and not harm all beings\u2014including yourself. Find a place where you can be undisturbed, and take this opportunity to reconnect with your true self, your loving and wise nature. Bring your attention to your body, your feet, your seat, your belly. Make any movements or adjustments that seem right to you\u2014you could stretch your legs or shake out your hands. Then let yourself come to stillness. This kind of stillness doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re frozen; it means you\u2019re steady, not flitting from branch to branch like a bird. Place a hand on your heart and a hand on your belly, and connect with your breath. Remember that your body is always breathing for you, and you can just receive it. Feel your breath: your stomach moving, your chest moving with each inhale and exhale. Now, allow sound to enter your ears. Relax your forehead, your cheeks, and your jaw, and feel your thighs and your feet. With one hand on your heart and one hand on your belly, I invite you to connect with a person who has inspired you or has cared about you\u2014someone with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship, maybe a teacher, a grandparent, or a very dear friend. Feel their presence beside you and imagine their face and their presence, and hear them say to you: May you act with wisdom and courage. May you be undisturbed by what you can\u2019t change right now. May you be at peace. Allow yourself to receive these blessings, hearing this special person repeat these phrases to you. For a few minutes, silently listen and take in these well-wishes: May you act with wisdom and courage. May you be undisturbed by what you can\u2019t change right now. May you be at peace. While you\u2019re practicing, you might get swept away from the phrases, and that\u2019s OK. Gently and patiently gather your attention, reconnect, and begin again. You can keep your connection with this person as you now connect with yourself. Feel your hand on your heart and your belly, and connect with your loving presence. You might imagine yourself as you looked this morning in the mirror, or you might imagine yourself in a moment of difficulty or discouragement. Now, say to yourself, May I act with wisdom and courage. May I be undisturbed by what I can\u2019t change right now. May I be at peace. Repeat these phrases to yourself, for a few minutes, as if you\u2019re giving yourself a gift. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to give yourself loving-kindness. You might notice that your attention has strayed or you\u2019re distracted. That\u2019s OK. Be gentle with yourself. Remember, you can begin again. Simply gather your attention, reconnect, and say the phrases: May I act with wisdom and courage. May I be undisturbed by what I can\u2019t change right now. May I be at peace. After a few minutes, or whenever you\u2019re ready, you can take a few minutes to practice tonglen, or taking and giving. Tonglen is a Tibetan compassion meditation, and it\u2019s very useful to quickly reconnect you to your compassionate and wise heart and to share it with others. Imagine someone you know who is struggling. You can begin tonglen practice by breathing in their fear, confusion, ill health, pain, or greed, and breathing out your patience, wisdom, kindness, and ease. Take a few minutes to take their suffering and give your love. If you like, as you breathe in, you can imagine their struggles as thick dark smoke that you inhale deeply into your heart, where it\u2019s transformed into light. Then, as you exhale, you can imagine this brilliant light flowing to this other person, and you can continue breathing in smoke and breathing out light. Next, give yourself permission to practice tonglen for yourself. Breathe in whatever you\u2019re struggling with\u2014your fears, your confusion, your insecurities, your self-judgment, any physical pain or illness\u2014and exhale love, compassion, ease, and reassurance. Spend at least five minutes taking in your suffering and giving yourself whatever you need to heal. Before you conclude your practice, I\u2019d like you to truly thank yourself and appreciate the value of your efforts\u2014and rejoice that you\u2019re part of a long lineage of human beings who share the deep intention to reconnect to themselves and each other and to be of benefit to the whole world.

Drawing from years of archival research, visits to the ruins of incarceration sites, interviews with survivors and their descendants, and the author\u2019s own family history, the book explores themes of history and memory, mourning and memorialization, ancestors and ghosts, and the resonances between forms of oppression and state violence across time and space. *** After their first winter in prison, and after the snow melted, the Issei at Fort Missoula noticed, all over the prison grounds, stones. Stones of infinite color, shape and design. \u201cPerhaps this is the site of an ancient river or sea,\u201d wrote Iwao Matsushita, one of the prisoners, in a letter to his wife, Hanaye, \u201cfor polished pebbles are strewn all over and everyone is immersed in collecting these stones,\u201d adding: \u201clike children\u201d (March 9, 1942). Hanaye received Iwao\u2019s letter at home in Seattle. She would soon be removed to Puyallup, then Minidoka. Iwao was detained by the FBI in the hours after Pearl Harbor. He arrived in Missoula on December 28, 1941. The valley that Sunday was covered in snow. In the spring, the ground softened, stones grew like flowers. The men gathered and polished the stones, made jewelry, sculptures, gifts for their families. Iwao mailed stones to Hanaye. \u201cSo avid is this stone picking,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat it is said that anyone not involved in this hobby is not human.\u201d Gathering stones was a way to be, in the midst of being criminalized by the country to which they had committed their futures, \u201chuman, like children.\u201d But children did not need to be a likeness, the innocence of the men, or the emphasis of their condition. They were there too\u2014in the camps, stone-picking their own prison grounds. \u201cWe were children, hunting stones,\u201d writes David Mura, in his poem \u201c An Argument: On 1942 .\u201d I moved to Missoula in August 2004 to begin my first semester in the MFA program in Creative Writing at the University of Montana. The commitment to be, or becoming, a poet was less about enrolling in a graduate program, and more about being close to my grandfather. I felt his presence, especially at night. Some nights I heard his voice. Distant, the amplitude of an ember. I wanted to bring his presence and his voice to where I was, or bring myself down to where I felt him to be: buried\u2014beneath the accumulation of withholdings and refusals by which the truth of his experience was obscured. By buried I mean also arrested: that some part of him had not managed, or been permitted, to be released, to join the rest of himself in the future. I spent four years wandering Fort Missoula. I did not know what I was looking for. I felt like the woman in Brynn Saito\u2019s poem, \u201cStone Returns, 70 Years Later,\u201d who, visiting Manzanar, \u201cpaces the length / of the barrack blocks, // the dead weight of midnight like a sea.\u201d She drops a stone into her pocket, \u201cslips into the night to stand in the field // and summon ghosts.\u201d The woman caresses the stone like a rosary. What, if and when the ghosts come, will happen? What will she\u2014what will I\u2014do? Stop pacing? Go home? I brought with me Imprisoned Apart: The World War II Correspondence of an Issei Couple , a collection of Iwao and Hanaye Matsushita\u2019s letters. My grandparents, who met shortly before my grandfather was sent to Fort Missoula, did not write letters to each other, none my grandmother saved or could remember. Iwao and Hanaye\u2019s letters became surrogates, idealizations. They wrote beauty and sadness, about when they would see each other again. I was drawn especially to their inventories of the weather, wildlife and wildflowers: \u201cFrozen fog makes branches beautiful with snow flowers against the azure sky. . . . Spring is deep, but the weather is unsettled. . . . Garden flowers are blooming one by one, but we have seldom chance to see them. . . . I\u2019ve enjoyed the dry pressed flowers enclosed in the last letter and cried with nostalgia remembering the fun days we\u2019ve had. . . . Listening to the quiet rush of the river in the morning, I feel as though you are calling to me. Even the coyote\u2019s howl is nostalgic. . . . I haven\u2019t heard any coyotes recently, though once in a while I see a scorpion. . . . The spring flowers don\u2019t move me as much since I saw them all last year. . . . Almost a year has wasted away since we parted. . . . I plan on turning to ashes.\u201d I read the letters in the barracks, the long fields, the road, by the river. I had a hard time believing the barracks, so undemonstrative, with their charming, willowy air, corresponded to my grandfather\u2019s prison. Iwao\u2019s letters were written not far from my grandfather. If I could hear Iwao\u2019s pen moving across the paper, then I might be able to hear the sounds that surrounded his pen, his breathing, the sounds in the room, that surrounded the room, out the door, my grandfather somewhere on the edge of those sounds. I was not introduced to the work of a single Japanese American poet in graduate school. Nor, for that matter, in any classroom between preschool and Missoula, Montana. There were no Japanese American poets on any syllabus or reading list, none were mentioned in class. It could have been construed from their absence that they were not relevant to the study of poetry. The tradition by which I was meant to understand myself was predominantly white, European American. If I was going to have a relationship with non-white poetry, especially by Asian Americans, especially by Japanese Americans, those relationships would have to be fugitive\u2014trysts. The Mansfield Library was named after Senator Mike Mansfield. Statues of him and his wife, Maureen, stand in a small grove of trees in front of the library, Mansfield gazing into campus with cryptic determination, Maureen gazing worshipfully, yet apprehensively, at him. Mansfield served on the board that interrogated the Issei at Fort Missoula. I could not go to the library without being forced to feel that same gaze pressing into my grandfather, and the gazes of all the hoary white men who believed, as Mansfield did, in their ability and authority to assess the fitness of a Japanese man to be free. Poetry was in the basement. I never saw anyone. I was always alone. I discovered, down there, in that solitude, my first Japanese American poets: Mitsuye Yamada, Lawson Fusao Inada, Janice Mirikitani, all of whom were incarcerated\u2014Yamada as a teenager in Minidoka, Inada as a young child in Jerome and Amache, Mirikitani as an infant in Rohwer. Their names glowed on the spines. Time froze, flowed backwards. I sat on the floor, and floated into the attention of these uncanny poets, their voices close, more precise. In the introduction to Legends from Camp , Inada, sitting in a petrified forest on a summer night, shares a \u201csimple show-and-tell\u201d about Japanese American history, using stones scattered around the forest as reference points. \u201cFor starters,\u201d he writes, \u201clet\u2019s say these rocks over here are Japan. And this smooth one where we\u2019re standing\u2014with the sand on it, see?\u2014is Amache, in the Colorado desert, not all that far from here. While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s let that little stone by your foot stand in for Leupp\u2014a \u2018mini-camp\u2019 right here on the Navajo Nation. (And, yes, we had major camps on other reservations; so you might say that it makes sense that the chief camps administrator went on to become chief of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where he \u2018re-deployed\u2019 his policy of \u2018relocation.\u2019 Which included, yes, \u2018termination.\u2019 Which reminds me\u2014down the ridge, in Europe, our relatives had base camps in Italy, France, Germany, and some of them liberated a camp called Dachau.)\u201d In Mitsuye Yamada\u2019s \u201cSearch and Rescue,\u201d an old man, thought to be \u201cout of his head,\u201d wanders beyond the barbed wire fence and disappears. A search party goes out. Yamada describes the \u201cfeel of freedom\u201d of following the man\u2019s \u201ctwisted trail\u201d through \u201cgnarled knuckles\u201d of greasewood. Where did he go? Maybe he was not \u201cout of his head\u201d\u2014maybe he was not even old\u2014but in his right mind, leaving behind him a \u201ctwisted trail\u201d to throw the search off. Maybe he was trying to get free. In \u201cShadow in Stone,\u201d Mirikitani visits Hiroshima (August 1984), wanders along the Motoyasu, the tributary of the Ota nearest to where the atomic bomb detonated. \u201cThe river speaks,\u201d she writes, then the river speaks. \u201cI received the bodies / leaping into my wet arms,\u201d the river says. People, on fire and melting, jumped or fell into the water and died, many of them immediately, against each other. \u201cI seek solace in the stone,\u201d Mirikitani continues, \u201cwith human shadow burned into its face.\u201d The bomb emitted a flash so bright, it imprinted people\u2019s shadows onto the ground. A man sitting on the steps of a bank, for example, waiting for the bank to open, his memory made permanent on the steps. \u201cI want to put my mouth to it,\u201d Mirikitani writes. I was shocked by the nakedness of her desire to kiss or breathe life into a shadow, but what was more shocking? \u201cThe Americans / have licked the core / of your inner organ!\u201d wrote Seishu Hozumi, tanka poet, hibakusha. I visited Hiroshima for the first time when I was 10. My sister (13) and I walked along the Motoyasu, the reflection of the skeletal Genbaku Dome wavering in the black-green water. I do not remember my parents. They were there, they brought us, it was their idea, where were they? The question seemed to be: What does it mean to be American? Or, what does America mean? Or, what does America do? Or, what does it mean to be you? \u201cT he atomic bomb was part of incarceration,\u201d Emiko Omori said. She and her sister Chizu, both of whom were incarcerated in Poston, were visiting my class\u2014Literature of Japanese American Incarceration, Colorado College (2023). We watched their documentary, Rabbit in the Moon , the day before. We talked about the processes of dehumanization at which the United States excels, and how the dehumanization of the Japanese American community helped shape the national disposition towards the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki into a debate over whether or not the mass murder of over one hundred thousand people in an instant\u2014the spontaneous release of a million suns; the incineration, first thing in the morning, of children on the banks of the Motoyasu\u2014was \u201cjustified.\u201d Rabbit in the Moon begins with Emiko Omori speculating on why she did not have children. Over images of children holding hands in a circle, twirling parasols, playing with a dog, eating noodles in highchairs, Omori says, \u201cLike me, my child would be an American, trapped in the body of an unwanted alien race. Could I conceal from my child how I wished he or she was more white, so as not to suffer the rejection I had just because of my face?\u201d This question, and these images, are preceded by a story about stones: \u201cIn the 1950s a Wyoming farmer unearthed a 55-gallon oil drum on land that was formerly a World War Il concentration camp. It had been buried by the inmates. It was filled with hundreds of small river stones . . . each one carefully inscribed with a Japanese character . . . coming to light like fragments of memory.\u201d The story is also told in the final pages of both Karen Ishizuka\u2019s Lost and Found: Reclaiming the Japanese American Incarceration and Duncan Ryuken Williams\u2019s American Sutra: A Story of Faith and Freedom in the Second World War . The Bureau of Reclamation, operating a road grader near the cemetery, hit the oil drum. There were almost two thousand stones. They were given to the white couple who owned the land (Nora and Les Bovee), who gave them as gifts to people who visited Heart Mountain. \u201cThey were my guiding light,\u201d Emiko Omori told me, about the stones. \u201cWhenever I wavered or wanted to throw in the towel when working on Rabbit , the little stones kept me going.\u201d According to American Sutra , two Japanese scholars determined that the characters on the stones were written by Nichikan Murakita, a Buddhist priest and master calligrapher, who was incarcerated with his wife, Masako, in Heart Mountain. They determined that Murakita had written one character per stone, the Scripture of the Blossom of the Fine Dharma, the Lotus Sutra . In \u201cPicking Up Stones,\u201d Lawson Inada tells the story of another Buddhist priest, Nyogen Senzaki, also incarcerated in Heart Mountain, who: went about gathering pebbles and writing words on them\u2014 common words, in Japanese with a brush dipped in ink. Then he\u2019d return them to their source, as best he could Other incarcerees made a game out of gathering Senzaki\u2019s stones, but: it was difficult to tell which was which: \u201chis\u201d pebbles, just plain pebbles, or those of which, in his hands, had remained mute, dictating silence . . . In her poem \u201c The Well ,\u201d Amy Uyematsu suggests that the stones were not the work of a single individual, but were each inscribed by a different hand, each crying out. And that each stone was inscribed with something different: the name of a person, a family, a single kanji snow \u00a0 \u00a0 wind \u00a0 \u00a0 cold \u00a0 \u00a0 sky shame \u00a0 \u00a0 home \u00a0 \u00a0 bird. The Bovees donated the rest of the stones to the Japanese American National Museum. A man named Shinjiro Kanazawa wrote a letter to the museum saying that the stones were written by the parents of deceased children and should be treated accordingly. \u201cWhen a child died,\u201d Ishizuka writes, paraphrasing Kanazawa, \u201cgrieving parents would write passages from sutras\u2014and sometimes their children\u2019s names\u2014on pebbles and build the stones into piles in order to help the deceased safely enter the other world.\u201d Heart Mountain sutra stones | Courtesy Japanese American National Museum, Gift of Leslie and Nora Bovee, 94.158.1 T here is a place children go when they die that is filled with stones of infinite color, shape and design. Sai no Kawara, the Dry Bed of the River of Souls. When the children find themselves\u2014abandoned, bewildered\u2014in the Dry Bed of the River of Souls, they begin, instinctively, to gather stones which they build, instinctively, into towers. It is only after building towers of stones that the children are able to achieve their afterlife. That is the instinct: The afterlife is inborn. But the children are not alone. With them in the Dry Bed of the River of Souls are demons who knock over the towers, scatter the stones. The demons appear, in 16th-century scrolls, red-hot and naked, with horns, fangs, and hooves, wielding iron clubs, wild manes whipping back, eyes pulling at their nerves, but that is not, or not exactly, how the demons appeared in the 20th century, and that is not how they are appearing in the 21st. The children, however\u2014and however terrorized they are\u2014are undeterred, and keep gathering stones, keep building towers, keep striving, together and alone, to cross the threshold out of the underworld and into the afterlife. \u201cTo live in Zen,\u201d said Senzaki, in his final dharma lecture (June 16, 1957), \u201cyou must watch your steps minute after minute, closely. As I have always told you, you should be mindful of your feet.\u201d I was invited by Williams to write a response to Senzaki\u2019s poetry for a book he was editing on the subject of religion in camp: Sutra and Bible: Faith and the Japanese American World War Il Incarceration , a companion to an exhibition of the same name at JANM. I did not know that Senzaki wrote poems, but of course he did. The act of \u201cgathering pebbles\u201d and writing \u201ccommon words\u201d on them, then returning them to their \u201csource,\u201d is one definition, maybe one of the clearest, of poetry. Here is the poem that I wrote: The Empty Hands for/after Nyogen Senzaki I cannot help but see and yet struggle to see in Nyogen Senzaki\u2019s poems faces floating along the body of a snake black, winding away from the spring flower blooming in America, that is the ritual effacement of those whose faces I cannot help but see in ours, in yours in my own floating along the body of a silent, surreptitious snake like scales, like sequins, shining suns like suns shining into the future with the shades drawn That is where we, the descendants, are and where we will always be Beckoning them with the empty hands of those from whom everything was taken Faces separated from their bodies bodies arrested, separated into phases that constitute what passes for history There is no such thing There is teaching. There is learning There is heaven, earth but history? There is no such thing if the light of a face if the light of many thousands of faces takes generations to reach us and to be seen clearly and to not even be seen, clearly but as a figurative concentration there is no such thing There is teaching, there is learning that is heaven, that is earth that is the endless reconstitution of face into the meaning and the order of independence in between heaven and earth, the empty hands open, and introduce their emptiness as sanctuary but, as the scripture of a harder-won fate will have it, cannot be filled, cannot be taken or even touched by the lives\u2014by the faces rising off the winding body and to which they are held out to which they are conditioning their beneficent and beautiful atmosphere to hold The empty hands must remain empty or they are not \u2666 Brandon Shimoda, excerpt from \u201cDry Bed of the River of Souls\u201d from The Afterlife Is Letting Go .

      "content_text": "Ideas Chinese Rituals of Death and the Afterlife How the concept of karma made its way into Chinese culture By Roger Jackson Oct 13, 2025 2025 Ghost Festival of Manka Qingshan Temple | Image via Wikimedia Commons In China, as in every other Asian culture to which Buddhism was introduced, the karmic eschatology developed in India was an essential part of the intellectual framework provided by proponents of the Dharma. Unlike in Sri Lanka and other adoption cultures, however, Buddhists arriving in China encountered long-established ideas and practices surrounding death and the afterlife. As Stephen Teiser notes, \u201cBefore the growth of Buddhism and the development of organized Taoism, Chinese belief maintained a relatively fluid boundary between this life and the next. Human existence was viewed as a temporary conglomeration of the two dominant forces in the universe, yin and yang\u201d\u2014which were roughly equivalent to the ideas of matter and spirit, or body and soul, respectively. At death, it was assumed, the lighter yang forces tended upward and the darker yin forces downward. In more immediate terms, \u201conce they have died, people are found in or near their graves, visiting ancestral halls and family banquets, and lodged in specific sites like\u2026the Yellow Springs.\u201d In this same period, adds Teiser: \u201c[A] passion for immortality is also evident\u2026ranging from the prolongation of life on earth to the search for an unending existence in heaven, various western paradises, or the islands of the east. Another important feature of the otherworld was that it was\u2026 organized along bureaucratic lines. Officers administered the empire of the dead, keeping records on every human being and taking charge of the spirit after death.\u201d Such a vision of the afterlife is broadly consonant with those found in many cultures, including that of Buddhist India, where a notion of postmortem reward or punishment for deeds performed in our earthly life provides some way of understanding what lies beyond the grave and why we end up where we do\u2014whether temporarily or for eternity. Thus, notes Teiser, when Buddhist cosmology and eschatology were introduced to China, they did not seek to supplant indigenous ideas so much as to supplement them, for \u201cboth indigenous Chinese and imported Buddhist conceptions viewed selfhood as a fluid process,\u201d not requiring a creator god or a fixed, eternal soul. Also, to an originally fluid and multi-local vision of the afterlife, Buddhism added one more option: that the person could be reborn in another bodily form. [Similarly,] Buddhist notions of karma refined and completed a system of judgment after death that had been in place for centuries. With the arrival of Buddhism came detailed and sophisticated Indian teachings about samsara, karma, and rebirth, and these certainly were accepted\u2014if not always understood\u2014by both monastic and lay Buddhists. Further, because they were not completely at odds with pre-Buddhist Chinese eschatology, they made an impression in Confucian and, even more so, Daoist circles. Buddhists, however, made their own adjustments. They often incorporated indigenous deities into their pantheon, and adapted their ritual practices to preexisting Chinese models. Within the general framework of their karmic eschatology, they adapted the Chinese vision of a bureaucratized afterlife, which eventually was enshrined in a short late-first-millennium apocryphal sutra known as the Scripture on the Ten Kings (Shiwangjing). This text describes a postmortem \u201cpurgatory\u201d presided over by ten officials, most of whose names are Chinese rather Indian in origin. These officials are responsible for meting out karmically appropriate rewards and punishments to the souls of the departed in the intermediate period between death and rebirth\u2014which in this case lasts not for seven weeks but for three years. Typically, the souls are brought in for a \u201chearing\u201d in the court of each of the ten kings, where they must defend their conduct. Bewildered as they are by the proceedings, souls often are represented by an advocate, the compassionate bodhisattva Ksitigarbha (C. Dizang ; Jp. Jizo ), who is reputed to have vowed in a previous life \u201cto deliver all sentient beings from suffering, especially those trapped in the lower regions of rebirth.\u201d Unsurprisingly, prayers to Ksitigarbha and offerings to the ten kings feature prominently in the ritual portions of the Scripture on the Ten Kings; these prayers and offerings might be made before one\u2019s own death or, afterward, by one\u2019s relatives, so as to assure that when, at the end of three years, one receives one\u2019s next rebirth assignment, it is a heavenly one. Of even greater eschatological significance in the Chinese Buddhist world are the texts and practices surrounding what generally is called the \u201cghost festival,\u201d which is held around the full moon of the seventh lunar month (typically in August), a moment that marks the end of the traditional rainy-season retreat undertaken by monks and nuns. It is reputed that on this occasion the gates of all the realms of rebirth are thrown open, and the departed are able to return to earth to visit their living relatives, who offer them incense; a banquet with empty seats for the visitors; material goods, including \u201cspirit money,\u201d which is ritually burned; and, at the festival\u2019s end, paper boats bearing candles to light their way back to the afterlife. Although the deceased inhabiting any realm of samsara are welcomed and feted, there is a particular focus on those spirits that have been consigned to the hungry ghost and hell realms. This is explained by the mythology underlying the festival, found in several Indic and Chinese sources. The most important is the Ullambana Sutra (C. Yulanpenjing ), an Indian Mahayana text that tells of the heroic, but unsuccessful, attempt by the Buddha\u2019s disciple Maudgalyayana to rescue his mother from rebirth in the hungry ghost realm, and the compensatory practice he is taught by the Buddha: making food offerings at the end of the summer retreat to the sangha, who then transfer the merit to his mother, freeing her. Similar tales are found in the Sanskrit Avadanasataka , where Maudgalyayana instructs laypeople to practice as the Buddha had instructed him; the Pali Petavatthu , which recounts Sariputra\u2019s failed attempt to release his mother from a hungry ghost existence, and his ultimate success in doing so when he offers a feast to the monastic community and then transfers the merit to his mother; and a Chinese esoteric text in which Ananda is visited by a terrifying hungry ghost who predicts the great disciple\u2019s own imminent death and rebirth as a preta, unless he makes appropriate offerings to all ghosts everywhere\u2014which Ananda is able to do when the Buddha teaches him a series of powerful preta-feeding mantras. As in India and Sri Lanka, these rituals for the departed play on the tension between, on the one hand, the removal from our purview of deceased loved ones, based on the seemingly iron-clad dictates of karmic law; and, on the other, the all-too-human need to retain some sense of communion with the departed\u2014and to believe, as well, that karmic results can be mitigated through ritual, magic, or some form of divine intervention. \u25c6 From Rebirth \u00a9 2022 by Roger R.

Sze succeeds Ada Lim\u00f3n in the position, and he is the first Asian American to receive the honor. \u201cAs the son of Chinese immigrants, and as a sophomore who decided to leave MIT to pursue a dream of becoming a poet, I never would have guessed that so many decades later I would receive this recognition,\u201d Sze said in a press release . \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that belongs to teachers, librarians, editors, poets, readers\u2014everyone who works tirelessly on behalf of poetry.\u201d Sze wrote his first poem during a calculus class at MIT, when he suddenly stopped paying attention to the lecture and scribbled down a couple of phrases. The following year, he transferred to UC Berkeley, where he began studying poetry and honing his craft through translating ancient Chinese texts . In the decades since, he has published twelve books of poetry, as well as two books of translations, and his work has garnered significant attention\u2014he is the recipient of the National Book Award, the Bollingen Prize for American Poetry for Lifetime Achievement, the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry, and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among many other accolades. During his tenure as Poet Laureate, Sze plans to focus specifically on translating poetry originally written in other languages and bringing it to new audiences\u2014a project he has already devoted significant attention to with The Silk Dragon II . \u201cAs Laureate I feel a great responsibility to promote the ways poetry, especially poetry in translation, can impact our daily lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe live in such a fast-paced world: Poetry helps us slow down, deepen our attention, and connect and live more fully.\u201d Read three of Sze\u2019s translations below, and then listen to him read and discuss them on an episode of Tricycle Talks . *** Drinking Wine (I) By Tao Qian (365\u2013427) A green pine is in the east garden, but the many grasses obscure it. A frost wipes out all the other species, and then I see its magnificent tall branches. In a forest, men do not notice it, but standing alone, it is a miracle. I hang a jug of wine on a cold branch; then stand back, and look again and again. My life spins with dreams and illusions. Why then be fastened to the world? Autumn Comes By Li He (790\u2013816) Wind in the plane tree startles the heart: a grown man\u2019s grief. By dying lamplight, crickets are weeping cold threads. Who will ever read the green bamboo slips of this book? Or stop the ornate worms from gnawing powdery holes? Such thoughts tonight must disentangle in my gut. In the humming rain, a fragrant spirit consoles this poet. On an autumn grave, a ghost chants Bao Zhao\u2019s poem, and his spiteful blood, buried a thousand years, is now green jade. Very White Moonlight By Wang Xiaoni (b. 1955) The moon in the deep night lights every sliver of bone. I inhale blue-white air. The world\u2019s trifles and smatterings turn into sinking fireflies. The city\u2019s a carcass. No living thing matches this pure nighttime color. At the window, I open curtains: before my eyes, heaven and earth merge in argentine white. In moonlight, I forget I\u2019m a human being. The last scene of life is quietly rehearsed in a shadow of plain color. Moonlight reaches the floorboards: my two feet have already whitened beforehand. *** Tao Qian, or Tao Yuanming (365\u2013427), was one of the great early Chinese poets. He was the first to celebrate the joys of drinking wine, and the illuminations that thereby came to him. He once worked as libationer for his district but soon resigned. He was then offered a job as keeper of records but also turned it down. Tao was always dissatisfied with official appointments and found, instead, contentment in his \u201cfields and garden.\u201d Li He (790\u2013816) wrote rich, complex poems that draw on Chinese shamanism and mythology. He was a child prodigy and, at age seven, stunned Han Yu when he wrote a poem for him, titled \u201cA Tall Official Carriage Comes on a Visit.\u201d Each morning, Li He rode on horseback, dashed off rough phrases of poems, and stuffed them in his saddlebag. Later in the day, he would lay out these phrases and incorporate them into poems. Wang Xiaoni (b. 1955) was born in Changchun, Jilin, and worked as a laborer for seven years during the Cultural Revolution. She graduated from Jilin University in 1982 and has worked as a film script editor and also taught at Hainan University. She has published more than twenty-five books of poetry, essays, and fiction. Her work in English is available in Something Crosses My Mind , translated by Eleanor Goodman (Zephyr Press & The Chinese University of Hong Kong Press, 2014). She lives in Shenzhen. \u29eb \u201cDrinking Wine (I)\u201d by Tao Qian, \u201cAutumn Comes\u201d by Li He, and \u201cVery White Moonlight\u201d by Wang Xiaoni, all translated by Arthur Sze.

      "content_text": "Personal Reflections The Art of Mindfulness A dharma teacher and pilgrimage leader recounts his first time visiting India\u2019s historic Buddhist sites with the late Thich Nhat Hanh. By Shantum Seth Oct 11, 2025 Thich Nhat Hanh (right) with Shantum Seth (left), Sister Chan Dinh Nghiem (center back), and Sunita (center front) in India, 1987. | Image courtesy Shantum Seth. The very first time Thay (the name by which Thich Nhat Hanh was known to me and many others) spoke to me, it was to ask me to bring the buddhadharma \u2014the teachings of the Buddha\u2014back to India. I did not know then how deeply those words would imprint themselves on my mind and give shape and meaning to my life. It was the summer of 1987. I was in Ojai, California, a burned-out activist and seeker who had never even heard of Thich Nhat Hanh. We were a bunch of us organizing an artists\u2019 retreat where Thay was to be the guiding teacher, but none of us could pronounce his name, so we called it the \u201cKick the Can\u201d retreat. Of course, once he arrived, his presence was unforgettable. I stayed in the background, not once speaking to him in the six days he was there, just doing a recording of his talks on a cassette player. But as he was leaving, just as he was about to get into the car, seeing me among the volunteers that had come to say goodbye, our eyes met, and he said, \u201cBring the good buddhadharma back to India.\u201d Six months later, when I returned to India, I found myself increasingly interested in Buddhism, gravitating to whichever Buddhist teachers I could find at home. I went on a five-day retreat with the Dalai Lama in Sarnath, and another ten-day retreat led by the Vipassana teacher S. N. Goenka in Igatpuri. This new curiosity about Buddhism led me back to the man with whom I had barely exchanged a word. Three months after I arrived home, I wrote to Thay, offering to host him in India, should he ever want to visit. I did not even dare to expect a reply. But, about a fortnight later, there was a call. It was Sister Chan Khong, who would later become the first person to be ordained as a monastic by Thay in our lineage, now known as the Plum Village tradition. Thay wished to come to India to visit the Buddhist sites , she said, and would I be able to help? Overjoyed, I accepted the offer instantly. Without knowing him well, I felt in my bones that he could be the teacher I had been looking for all my life. And this was my chance of a lifetime to be with him. The only problem was that I was clueless about how to organize the trip; I knew almost nothing of the Buddhist pilgrimage routes. I had been to some of these sites as a child. But organizing for Thay was another matter. Nevertheless, I set to work. I went on a reconnaissance trip with a friend to all the Buddhist sites, some of which I had never visited before, trying to locate accommodations and confirm logistics. How different it was when Thay arrived! He came with an entourage of thirty people from different countries, from Argentina to Australia and France to the US. They spent the first three days in Delhi. In my innocence\u2014and to keep costs down\u2014I had arranged for their accommodation in the YMCA youth hostel frequented by backpacking tourists from abroad. But Thay and his group were unperturbed, making themselves serenely at home among the backpackers. They even infused the youth hostel with an energy of mindfulness it had never experienced before or since. Thich Nhat Hanh (right) with Shantum Seth (left) and Broth Chan Phap Ung (center) in India, 1987. | Image courtesy Shantum Seth. The evening after the group landed, I invited Thay to our home. Our home then was a magisterial bungalow, Rajaji Marg, in the center of New Delhi, allotted to my mother, who was then a senior judge at the Delhi High Court. Besides my parents, brother, and sister, I had invited some twenty of my local friends to meet Thay. It was supposed to be one of those tea parties that my mother often hosted, but somehow Thay\u2019s presence transformed the occasion for everyone there. As we were having tea in the drawing room overlooking a large garden, the telephone rang. My mother instantly got up to attend to the call. Thay did not even seem to notice, but when she returned from her call, Thay began sharing with us his practice of telephone meditation\u2014the art of stopping and coming back into the present moment each time one hears the sound of the telephone. He turned even the sound of the telephone into a meditation bell. That tea party was so memorable for the way Thay used every moment as a deep teaching, without appearing to teach at all. On the surface, he was just being social, talking to everyone, but there was not a moment when he ceased teaching. After tea, we went to sit in the garden. It had a pond with purple waterlilies. I had laid out some cotton carpets, thinking that after our tea, we would sit in the garden to hear Thay teach. But Thay was teaching long before we went into the garden, and we didn\u2019t even think of it as a teaching. Whether it was inside or outside, Thay sat equally still, and his calm communicated itself to us, whether we realized it or not. In the garden, Thay began to share very gently and informally what he had been doing all through the tea party\u2014the art of mindfulness in every moment of our daily lives. He stood up, and all of us got up too. Walking a few gentle steps, he spoke about how to stay mindful of our steps and breath at the same time. Suddenly, I was seeing our garden as if for the first time. With Thay leading us, I could look more deeply into the beautiful Sita Ashok tree in the garden, the trunk, the shapes of the leaves, the colors, and the first glimmerings of the realization that even though we could not see the beautiful sunset-colored flowers of the tree, they would manifest themselves in the right season. And it was not just me. Each of the thirty or more of us in the garden was touched deeply by Thay\u2019s simple teaching and walking. Several, including my brother, decided to join for part or the whole of the pilgrimage. My sister had already offered to come anyway just to support me. I was aware, of course, that Buddhism had pretty much disappeared from India, the land of its birth, but it was during this first pilgrimage with Thay that I discovered how much of the old animosity against Buddhism still persisted. Thay wanted to start the pilgrimage in Sarnath, as that is where the Buddha had offered his first teachings. By the time we reached the government guesthouse in Sarnath, our group was tired and in need of a good sleep. But just outside the guesthouse, a tent had been pitched and loud Hindu bhajan were blaring out of it till late at night from discordant speakers. The noise was unbearable. I went across to the tent to try and get them to either switch off the microphones till the morning or at least to reduce the volume. I found just two people in the tent, half asleep, by a cassette recorder and amplifier. I explained to them that there was a community of Buddhist pilgrims across from them who needed their sleep. But my plea to them had an opposite effect. Instead of reducing the volume, they increased it, saying that Hinduism was the religion of this land and not Buddhism. But Thay was teaching us in his gentle, unassuming way how Hinduism and buddhadharma are inseparable. When we were in Varanasi, the daily Hindu rituals by the river Ganga were very much part of our pilgrimage. Thay made us understand that the Ganga was not sacred just for Hindus; its sacredness belonged to all spiritual traditions. When we walked into the Deer Park in Sarnath, Thay paused near the entrance to the park and had us gather around. He shared how each step we were making was literally in the footsteps of the Buddha. If we were mindful, we could walk with the awareness of the Buddha and transform our feet into Buddha feet. As we walked, in a single line, following Thay, it felt like we were walking with the Buddha. Occasionally, he would gently ring a small bowl-shaped meditation bell, and all of us would stop. We would touch the present moment in a deep way, aware of our breath, the positions of our body, the temperature, the light breeze, the sounds, the colors. All that was within and around us in those moments. Each day was magical on the pilgrimage. Each day was a profound teaching. In Bodh Gaya, Thay offered to the bodhi tree growing there on the site of the tree where the Buddha had awakened a copy of his biography of the Buddha, Old Path White Clouds , that he had just completed. We spent a week there, staying at the Vietnamese temple that had just opened. Most days, we visited the Mahabodhi temple. We sat under the bodhi tree, meditated, and Thay would teach. Thay had a way of bringing the Buddha alive for us. When he talked of the Buddha, it was as if we were under the same tree that the Buddha had sat under 2,600 years ago. He brought alive the Buddha\u2019s physical and psychological struggle, the children who became his companions, and the natural vegetation, the tree under which he sat, and the Niranjana River flowing close by. The Buddha\u2019s presence shone through Thay, sitting there so calmly, smiling and being totally present. When he looked up at the bodhi leaves, we saw the Buddha through Thay\u2019s eyes and understood how the Buddha had possibly gleaned his deep teachings of interbeing by penetrating the reality of the leaf\u2014the sunshine, the clouds, the earth, the air, and space that had enabled it to manifest. Each day, we walked meditatively around the temple, attentive to each step, as the Buddha had been. On one side of the temple, there were stones laid down on the path as reminders of each mindful step the Buddha took. But with Thay there, we hardly needed a reminder. Each mindful step we took, he told us, helped others to do the same. With Thay there as our teacher, we were also learning to be co-teachers.

Each moment was something to be cherished, fully alive and present to whoever and whatever we encountered. As we passed farmers and pastoralists, we stopped and spoke to them about their lives and interests, the rearing of animals, and the seasons. We joined some of them in threshing. Children from the villages gathered around us, and we occasionally stopped and sat in the shade of a bamboo thicket or large banyan tree, shared tea, and sang songs. Thay picked up a bamboo leaf and showed the children how to split and roll it so that when they blew through it, it made a sound like a flute. By the time we got to Rajgir, I could see how deeply Thay knew the Buddha and the places associated with his life. Vulture Peak was especially dear to him. When I was making the schedule, he had suggested we spend five days there. I wondered why\u2014as a child, I had visited the hot springs in Rajgir with my father, but never Vulture Peak, as it was just a hill with nothing there of special interest. But those five days spent at Vulture Peak were truly special when experienced with Thay. Each morning, we would climb the hill, often before sunrise, and come down after sunset. Walking behind him, as he placed his feet on the same path the Buddha had walked 2,600 years ago, and stopping from time to time to look over the hills and forested landscape unchanged since the Buddha\u2019s time, it felt like we were walking with the Buddha, seeing with his eyes. With Thay leading us, it was easy to feel a deep sense of non-separation with everything within and around us. Watching the sunset each evening as the Buddha had, in silence, gave us a sense of great joy. An especially memorable day was on November 10, 1988, when Thay ordained the first three monastics in our order. We climbed up to Vulture Peak and all thirty-five of us seated ourselves in a formal arrangement on the flat platform at the top of the peak. Thay was in his formal sanghati monastic robe. There was only one other monk from Vietnam, Dr. Lam (in whose guest house we had stayed in Bodh Gaya), and one nun, but it felt as if there were a huge gathering of monastics and lay people, including the Buddha, to witness this historic ceremony. In his gentle yet solemn way, Thay conducted the ordination ceremony. We were all so moved, and there were tears of joy as Sister Chan Khong, Sister Annabel, and Sister Thanh Minh\u2019s heads were shaved. Later, Thay ordained five members into the Order of Interbeing and five others, including me, were offered the three refuges of the Buddha, dharma, and sangha, and the five precepts, as they were called at that time (later they would be known as the five mindfulness trainings). I was given a dharma name in Sanskrit by Thay that day, Chitta Bhadra, which Thay translated as \u201cKindness of the Heart.\u201d Our pilgrimage journey had been tough, and some of the living conditions were very basic\u2014there were rats running across our bedrooms in Rajgir. So, when we arrived in Patna, we were all overjoyed to find running hot water, air conditioning, and an excellent restaurant in our hotel. At least the next three days and nights that we had scheduled in Patna could be spent in comfort. But the next morning after breakfast, Thay called me aside to say that he had decided we would go on to Vaishali. I was dismayed as it would be impossible to find decent accommodation in Vaishali, but Thay was adamant that instead of staying two more nights in Patna, he wanted to move to Vaishali. Thay was not at all concerned with creature comforts or accommodation; so, we left it to the group to choose for themselves whether they wanted to stay back in Patna or risk the limited and basic accommodation available in Vaishali. Finally, only eight of us left for Vaishali. We found only three rooms available in a government guest house there and had to stay three or four to a room. We were welcomed in a most beautiful and touching way. The families were poor and laid out some cloth for us to sit on the earth in front of their homes. They chanted the three refuges and the five precepts in Pali, as the Sri Lankans do (and may have taught them). After that, our group offered some chants and made some offerings at their small shrine. Thay loved being there, and the locals were so happy with our visit that they suggested we start a center near them. They said they would help in any way, and Thay later mentioned to me that we could start a Plum Village mindfulness practice center in Vaishali. At Lumbini, we visited the Ashokan Pillar with the inscription in the Brahmi script of the third century BCE, mentioning that the Buddha had been born here. Each evening, we would sit to share in dharma discussions, while we stayed at the garden guesthouse. Thay emphasized how each birth was miraculous and if there were the right causes and conditions, as had been at the time of the Buddha, any child had the potential to awaken to be a Buddha. The pilgrimage was nearly over, but not Thay\u2019s teaching. We crossed back over the Indo-Nepal border at Bhairava/ Sanauli. There was a long row of trucks waiting to get a permit to get across the border; this created a massive traffic jam. Fortunately, as we were a passenger bus, we were able to edge our way past the trucks and, with a few smiles and a lot of patience, got our passports stamped. Throughout all this, Thay remained completely calm, accepting, and absorbing things as they were and responding appropriately with just the right amount of energy needed. As we closed our pilgrimage circle, which we had named \u201cIn the Footsteps of the Buddha,\u201d Thay suggested each one of us write an insight poem; one that was inspired by our journey together. It was a lovely way to hear each person\u2019s voice and insight. The pilgrimage was ending, but our lives would never quite be the same again. For me, it felt as if this was the beginning of a spiritual journey that I am still on. Thay encouraged me to go on the same pilgrimage each year as a practice and invite others to join me so that they too could meet the Buddha. Since then, I have been on this pilgrimage\u2014In the Footsteps of the Buddha and Thay\u2014more than a hundred times. I feel blessed to have had this practice suggested to me by Thay, my teacher. Each time I go, I feel closer to the Buddha, my spiritual guides, my land ancestors, and the living dharma. Thay had shown us the path of awakening as a human being, of being the white cloud in the blue sky. He always had confidence that we, his students, had that potential too. On the night of November 11, 2014, I was in Kushinagar, where the Buddha had passed away. It was there that I heard that Thay himself might be dying. He had suffered a massive stroke. Over the next days and weeks, it was uncertain that he would survive. I went to visit him in the hospital in France over Christmas, and though extremely weak, he held my hand and smiled. Miraculously, Thay had been revived, and with excellent medical support and deeply compassionate care, he lived on, though he could not speak again and was confined to a wheelchair. However, his presence was very strong. When Gitu and I visited him in Thailand, he looked deeply into her eyes and then my eyes for a long period, transmitting his feelings without words, deep into our being. Thay was determined to return to Vietnam and live the last phase of his life there at the Tu Hieu monastery in Hue, where he had been ordained and was the de facto abbot. When I awoke on January 22, 2022, I saw a message from the abbot of Plum Village\u2019s Upper Hamlet: \u201cOur teacher is now free as a cloud.\u201d Thay had passed away peacefully at midnight at our root temple in Hue. I felt that Thay was free as the Buddha was, many centuries ago. There are not many who are able to transcend the constraints and concepts of birth and death. Thay had shown us the path of awakening as a human being, of being the white cloud in the blue sky. He always had confidence that we, his students, had that potential too. His presence and teaching touched the lives of countless people, and his presence remains in all of us who were fortunate to have known, heard, and read him. His lineage continues in many schools, in many hearts, and in the many sanghas in the Plum Village tradition. He helped cultivate and renew the branch of Engaged Buddhism in the land of its birth in a way that is accessible and appropriate to our times. \u2666 Adapted from Touching Peace: Practicing the Art of Mindful Living by Thich Nhat Hanh. \u00a9 1992, 2009, 2025 by Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism, Inc.

      "content_text": "Teachings Birth and Death in Every Moment The late Zen master on recognizing our true nature and touching the ultimate By Thich Nhat Hanh Oct 10, 2025 Image by Carlos Torres \u201cWhat happens when we die?\u201d is a good question. A good answer should be based on evidence. It\u2019s not a matter of belief or faith, but of looking deeply. Through the practice of mindfulness, concentration, and insight, we can see for ourselves the true nature of birth and death. Many people misunderstand the word reincarnation, so I don\u2019t like to use it. The word suggests that there is a soul, a spirit, that exists apart from the body. And when the body is destroyed or decomposed, the soul leaves and searches for another body to enter. I prefer the word continuation. There is nothing that leaves something and enters something else\u2014continuation is constantly taking place. At first, you may believe in a self or a soul that always remains the same. But in reality, there is nothing that can remain the same in two consecutive moments. \u201cYou\u201d of this moment is no longer the \u201cyou\u201d of the previous moment. We cannot see this if we have not gone deep enough and touched the true nature of no birth and no death, no self and no other, no being and no nonbeing. Impermanence of Consciousness Many philosophers and scientists alike have claimed that consciousness has a cinematographic nature. When we project a film, it appears to be something continuous and long-lasting. But we know that the film consists of separate pictures that last only a fraction of a second. Consciousness is like that; it\u2019s only a flash, lasting just one millisecond. And because moments of consciousness succeed each other continuously, we have the impression that consciousness is something long-lasting. In fact, the permanent nature of consciousness is just an illusion. It\u2019s like a flame on the tip of a candle. You think that the flame is the same flame as a moment before, but that\u2019s not true. There\u2019s a succession of many flames, one after another, that give the impression of a fixed identity. The flame of this moment gives rise to the flame of the next moment. And the flame of the next moment gives rise to the flame of the following moment. In Buddhism, there is another beautiful illustration of this. At night, someone holds a torch and draws a circle in the air with it in the dark. If they are doing the movement quickly and you are standing at a distance, you have the impression that there is a circle of fire. But, in fact, there is only a succession of points of flame. The circle of fire is only an optical illusion. Permanence is an illusion, and the basic mistake is to believe that we have a consciousness, or a soul, that is always the same. Everything is impermanent. Mentally and physically, you are of a cinematographic nature; you are reborn in every instant. You are renewed in every instant to become a new person, a new being. And if you know how to do it, your renewal is beautiful. With karma , you can assure a better, more beautiful continuation. If you know how to handle your thinking, your speech, and your actions, you will become more beautiful. The fact is that you don\u2019t need to wait until you die in order to see what happens to you. Look in the present moment and see that birth and death are going on in you at every moment, both in your body and in your consciousness. Impermanence, Not Annihilation When you look through a family album, you may see a picture of yourself as a 3-year-old child. Are you the same person as that little child? The answer is this: You are neither the same person nor a completely different one. You have grown up into an adult. Your form, feelings, mental formations, and perceptions are different. But you are not a completely different person either because you are a continuation of that child. Many years ago during a retreat, I gave a kernel of corn to each child. I asked them to go home, plant it in a pot, and water it every day. Then, once the kernel had grown into a plant, the child could ask, \u201cMy dear plant of corn, do you remember when you were just a tiny little seed?\u201d The plant of corn might respond, \u201cMe? A little seed? I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d I told the children that, if they were eloquent enough, they could convince the plant of corn that she was once a tiny kernel. Looking skillfully, we\u2019d see the kernel of corn still there in the plant of corn. \u201cIs the kernel still alive, or has it died?\u201d is quite a deep question to ask a child. Yet it is possible even to teach children about no birth and no death, no being and no nonbeing. In Buddhism, we talk about signlessness . Sign means form or appearance. Once a growing plant, the kernel of corn may no longer be recognizable as its sign, its original appearance, but that does not mean that it isn\u2019t there anymore. When we were conceived, we were also a little seed\u2014much smaller than the kernel of corn. That seed became a little child, but where is that little child now? Are they still alive? When those of us who practice meditation look at the plant of corn, we can still see the kernel. It is there, alive, although it doesn\u2019t appear in its familiar form. Do you think that the little child in you has died, or do they continue in you? Do you talk to them, or are you too busy? Birth and death are two sides of the same coin\u2014you cannot pull them apart. We may think that if the grain does not die, the birth of a plant is not possible. But is it true that something must die for something else to be born? When a cloud becomes rain, is something dying or not? Is something being born or not? The death of a cloud means the birth of the rain. If the birth of the rain is not there, the death of the cloud is not possible. Birth and death are two sides of the same coin\u2014you cannot pull them apart. In the word signlessness, sign means the appearance, the form, the object of our perception. A cloud has its own form or appearance. And thanks to that appearance, we recognize it as a cloud. The appearance of the rain is different from the appearance of the cloud. But, as the Buddha says, where there is perception, there is deception. If we are caught by the sign or the appearance of something, we are fooled; we cannot see the truth. If a cloud cannot die, then our loved ones cannot die either. With our normal way of looking, we think that our grandmother, our grandfather, our ancestors have died. But when we look with the eyes of signlessness, we see that they are still alive in every cell of our body. We can talk to our grandfather, to our grandmother, right in this very moment\u2014they will hear us. Practicing signlessness is the way to touch reality. If you are not caught in the sign, you can have a correct perception of reality. If the child has the eyes of signlessness, they can see the kernel of corn in the plant of corn. Whether we succeed in our contemplation on birth and death depends on whether we can see things with the eyes of signlessness. Transcending Notions, Touching Nirvana Let us consider a flame. Before it manifests as a flame, you cannot say that it does not exist, or that it belongs to the realm of nonbeing. And when it manifests as a flame, you cannot say that it now belongs to the realm of being either. It cannot be described in terms of being or nonbeing. Before we light the match, we can say to the flame, \u201cMy dear little flame, I know you are there somewhere. Manifest for us.\u201d And the flame says, \u201cDear Th\u1ea7y, I am ready to manifest for you. All conditions seem to be sufficient, except the last one.\u201d The match is there, the matchbox is there, oxygen is there, and when we provide the flame with the final necessary condition\u2014striking the match\u2014she manifests beautifully. Now if I ask the flame, \u201cMy dear little flame, where have you come from?\u201d The flame will respond: \u201cDear Th\u1ea7y, I have not come from anywhere. My true nature is no coming. I have not come from the north, the south, the east, or the west. When conditions are sufficient, I manifest.\u201d After blowing the flame out, we may ask, \u201cDear little flame, we miss you. Where have you gone?\u201d And the flame will answer, \u201cDear Th\u1ea7y, I have not gone anywhere. I do not go to the north, south, east, or west. When conditions are no longer sufficient, I stop manifesting in this form in order to manifest in other forms. Heat, smoke, and ash are my new manifestations.\u201d For a few seconds, the flame creates a beautiful image that penetrates into all of us. It creates heat that enters the cosmos. It creates some particulates and gas that go up to become a cloud of smoke. During her brief manifestation, we can say that the flame produces actions and continues in us and around us. Nothing is lost; the flame does not die. For those of us who know how to meditate, we see clearly that the flame always continues. Our true nature is the same as that of the cloud and the flame: the nature of no birth and no death, no being and no nonbeing, no coming and no going. The ultimate truth transcends all kinds of notions, including notions of being and nonbeing, birth and death, coming and going. If you don\u2019t let go of these notions, you can never touch the ultimate. Nirvana in the Present Moment The ultimate is nirvana . Nirvana is the extinction of suffering and afflictions, and this is possible only when we can extinguish notions like birth and death, being and nonbeing. We can define nirvana in very clear terms: It is the absence of all notions. Suffering is born from notions, and so nirvana is the absence of suffering. Nirvana is available right in the here and now. Suppose you are walking barefoot, accidentally step on a briar, and get some thorns in your foot. Immediately you lose all peace and happiness. As soon as you remove one thorn, you get some relief. And the more thorns you remove, the greater the relief and peace. In the same way, the removal of our afflictions\u2014our anger, fear, and despair\u2014is the presence of nirvana. As soon as we begin to remove our afflictions, we start to experience nirvana. Some people think that when you touch nirvana, you don\u2019t have to be reborn anymore, that you are freed from the rounds of birth and death; you now belong to the realm of nonbeing. But that view is very misleading. Even some Western scholars of Buddhism hold this wrong view. They believe that the aim of Buddhism is to achieve a kind of eternal death, or eternal nonbeing. But our aim as practitioners is not to reach a state of annihilation. The Buddha\u2019s view is a kind of insight that transcends both the notion of total annihilation and the notion of eternal life. Through meditation, we can remove these kinds of notions so that we have right view. Once you remove these and other pairs of notions\u2014birth and death, being and nonbeing, self and other\u2014you have peace, you have nirvana, and you don\u2019t worry anymore. \u2666 Reprinted from Reincarnation by Thich Nhat Hanh, 2025, with permission from Parallax Press.

      "content_text": "Personal Reflections \u2018On the Joy of Otherness\u2019 Professor and novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen on death, writing, and finding lightness in the multiplicity of self. By Viet Thanh Nguyen Oct 09, 2025 Viet Thanh Nguyen in Rome, Italy, July 12, 2017. | Credit: Matteo Nardone/Pacific Press/Alamy Live News This year, as with every passing year, I cannot help but hear the distant rumble of \u201cTime\u2019s wing\u00e8d chariot hurrying near.\u201d My beloved, beautiful four-year-old daughter heralded this chariot, not long ago. Over dinner, she smiled at me with her eyes lit up, then leaned close and said, \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re old. You\u2019re going to die soon. I love you. Will there be a funeral?\u201d She probably will not remember these words. But I will, because they touch on\u2026the lightest and the heaviest subject: the joy of otherness. This topic of joy is heavy, because I am a pessimist. And when it comes to otherness, the associations are often gloomy, revolving around victimization and marginalization or trauma and erasure, all subjects in which I revel. But it is no wonder that some who are othered would rather feel joy than pain. They simply yearn to be human, although humanity itself comes with a heaviness inherent. [When I first] attempted to become a writer, grappling with Very Serious Subjects and Very Important Literature, otherness was a major concern, but it was the alterity of sociological, political, historical categories: race, class, gender, nationality, and so on. What I had not grappled with was the otherness of those who had been right next to me from my origins, my mother and father, my older brother, my oldest sister, whom we had left behind in Vi\u1ec7t Nam at the end of war, where, in the aftermath, the victors dispatched her to labor on a youth brigade to rebuild the country, a fate that could have been mine. Perhaps partly because of this fear of understanding my siblings and my own parents, I had no desire to be a parent, to test myself with children and my own family as my parents had been tested by me and my siblings. Writing was the only creative act that interested me, not fathering, and so when I learned that my first child was due to arrive\u2014I panicked. My life, as I knew it, was over, and it hardly seemed fair, for I had not yet finished my novel. But my son\u2019s impending birth focused me, and I completed the [first] draft a few days before his birth. For the next few months, I revised the novel at night while this strange new being slept, so small and light, yet so heavy on my conscience and my soul. He lay swaddled and immobilized on the futon in his mother\u2019s office while I sat at her desk, keeping an eye on Little Oedipus as I wrestled with sentences, word choices, rhythms. Anytime my heir stirred, which was often, I stuck a bottle of formula in his mouth, a story over which he now chortles. I rewrote and kept vigil until three in the morning. Then it was my turn to sip on my formula\u2014single malt Scotch\u2014until five in the morning, when his mother took over. So it was that we fattened our son and kept him alive. My infant son was my other, perhaps still is an other to me in a wondrous way, as I must be some looming other to my daughter, intimate and yet incomprehensible. I think I know my son very well, but perhaps I do not know him at all. And why would I want to know him, or my daughter, completely? It is impossible that they would know me absolutely. The reserve of our own mystery to ourselves and to our closest others is a source of consternation, but also, potentially, joy. Becoming a father frightened me more than anything, including writing, which caused me much anguish that I willingly embraced. Writing, like God, is an incomprehensible other that can inspire as much as torment. Writing requires faith as well as a willingness to abide mystery, the unknown source from where creativity emerges. Still, much of creativity springs not from magic or mystique but from dull discipline, as in Haruki Murakami\u2019s idea that writing is mostly a matter of routine, even punishment, until it is not. In his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running , Murakami compares writing to running, particularly marathons, including the original marathon route in Greece, and even running an ultramarathon of sixty-two miles. I run a few miles on a treadmill in my basement next to the washing machine and dryer, watching instructors on my phone exhort me to reach my goal with clich\u00e9s so trite I would be appalled to write them. Nevertheless, the exhortations work, encouraging me to run a few more miles, which inspires me to think I can write a few more pages. I suspect that in the end what my writing will uncover about my self, or my many selves, is that I am authentic only to my own inauthenticity. Perhaps Murakami\u2019s novels themselves express that relationship between the mundane and the mysterious, his narrators rather unremarkable, even his prose somewhat flat, all contrasted against a moment when the surreal or the weird disrupts the routine and reveals a parallel world that might swallow up a character. In his novel Sputnik Sweetheart , for example, a woman on vacation finds herself stuck on a Ferris wheel. She can see her apartment, and using binoculars to look into her room, sees herself or someone exactly like her having sex with an unknown man. This external shock of an inexplicable world bifurcates her internally and leads to a sense of losing another self that she has just discovered. Oneself as another, oneself as the other\u2014perhaps one reason for my fascination with these manifestations of otherness is because of how much the creative process seems to be a relationship both to the puzzling, occasionally sublime world outside of ourselves and the haunting otherness inside ourselves. The primal scene of witnessing one\u2019s own otherness can be traumatic, with the treatment of our others being sometimes vicious and violent, exploitative and murderous. But willfully accessing one\u2019s otherness through something like a creative act possesses elements of joy, at least for me, even if that access can usually only be found through hard work, tedious routine, and a degree of pain. I acknowledge the pain, even if I resist romanticizing it, for the fetishized suffering of the individual male artist is not deserving of more attention than the pain of manual labor or of actual childbirth, which canonical art has usually treated as a minor theme. Reflecting on my parents, whose devotion to capitalism and Catholicism I rebelled against, I can see now, with the forgiving distance of time, far removed from the dim recesses of the S\u00e0iG\u00f2n M\u1edbi, that they were creative people. Entrepreneurs. Are founders of small businesses any less inspired than writers who publish in small magazines? The reverse is also true, that the contributions of such writers, their ability to access the joy of otherness through writing, is no less important than what capitalists accomplish. The creativity of my parents enabled my inventive urges, and their hard, arduous labor, grounded in the unglamorous and dangerous reality of a grocery store where they stood all day, made it possible for me to sit in a chair, gaze at a screen, and fiddle with my word count in between doses of social media. The act of creativity, whether that of my parents or me, is carried out in the face of vast indifference. The monk Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh , in Fragrant Palm Leaves , expressed something similar when he stood before the Vietnamese landscape: \u201cThe forest was so immense, we felt minuscule. I think we shouted to overcome our feeling of being utterly insignificant.\u201d Shouting into the wilderness is what the act of creation can feel like, our human voices measured against the vast powers of the natural and mystical worlds. Even a fabled spiritual leader like Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh needed to shout sometimes, not as an aberration from spiritual discipline but perhaps the periodic expression of it, as the occasional book from a writer expresses years of quiet and self- controlled labor. I imagine a parallel exists between creative and religious discipline. The religious rely on the daily drills of rituals, texts, and prayers to remind themselves that God exists, with God and the divine being our human way of trying to understand the ultimate act of creation\u2014how we and our world came into being. My parents prayed every day, and although I do not believe in their God, I am moved by the fact that when my mother died, she could still, despite her diminishment, recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer with my father. Contemplating her passage into some other realm, I take comfort in Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh\u2019s words about his own mother\u2019s death: \u201cFor the first four years after she died, I felt like an orphan. Then one night she came to me in a dream, and from that moment on, I no longer felt her death as a loss.\u201d My mother has visited my brother in a dream, bringing him comfort, but she has never come to me, another mystery I do not understand. Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh continues about his mother: \u201cI understood that she had never died, that my sorrow was based on illusion . . . She did not exist because of birth, nor cease to exist because of death. I saw that being and nonbeing are not separate. Being can exist only in relation to nonbeing, and nonbeing can exist only in relation to being. Nothing can cease to be.\u201d I do not remember if I had read Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh\u2019s words before I wrote my first novel. But the conclusion of The Sympathizer also concerns nothing, when the narrator reflects on the famous slogan of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh: \u201cNothing is more precious than independence and freedom.\u201d Those words helped motivate a revolution that freed Vi\u1ec7t Nam from foreign interference and unified a country, as well as forcing my parents to flee. Nearly thirty years later, I returned to a S\u00e0i G\u00f2n of the early 2000s still struggling with economic inequality and some disillusionment with the promises of communism, where I heard a sarcastic, possibly bitter joke that I would then include in the novel\u2019s conclusion: \u201cWhat is more precious than independence and freedom? Nothing.\u201d Some readers interpreted the ending as nihilistic, but that is not correct. To take inspiration from Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, nothing only exists in relation to something, and vice versa. God is only one of the most obvious examples of a nothing that one portion of humanity has turned into something, an otherness that elicits sacrifice and murder, joy and suffering, love and hate. Unlike me, who saw nothing when it came to God, my mother and father could see something. And my father, now having forgotten almost everything, can still say the Lord\u2019s Prayer. All one has to do is prompt him, and from somewhere deep inside the words emerge, unforgotten because of his life of discipline. I find it joyful to know that a deep well of otherness exists inside of him that I cannot detect, one that gives him life and hope. I admire my father\u2019s discipline, the relentlessness of it that delivers a believer to the final destination, which is a confrontation with one\u2019s own otherness, carried out utterly in private and with that greater otherness that God symbolizes. Jorge Luis Borges, in his Norton Lectures, This Craft of Verse , had this to say: \u201cI have toyed with an idea\u2014 the idea that although a man\u2019s life is compounded of thousands and thousands of moments and days, those many instants and those many days may be reduced to a single one: the moment when a man knows who he is, when he sees himself face to face.\u201d I do not know if Borges ever found himself face to face with himself, and I do not know if I have seen my genuine, authentic face either, even though I have looked at myself often, in the mirror and in my writing. Suspicious of authenticity\u2014having been accused of being inauthentic many times\u2014I suspect that in the end what my writing will uncover about my self, or my many selves, is that I am authentic only to my own inauthenticity. The poet Theodore Roethke put his relationship of author to self another way in one of his poems, where he wrote: Being myself, I sing The soul\u2019s immediate joy. In my case, that is the joy of otherness, an awareness that even seeing oneself face to face means that the very notion of otherness is present. One can only come face to face with oneself if one is already at least twofold, encountering oneself in an actual mirror or in the mirror of one\u2019s soul. And what if, to complicate Borges, one sees that one has many faces rather than just two? Fernando Pessoa, as a person and artist, was someone who dwelled constantly on his own multiplicity. He is famous for creating many authorial selves and names through which he wrote, each one with its own distinctive character. In his best-known work translated into English, The Book of Disquiet , he wrote that \u201cEach of us is more than one person, many people, a proliferation of our one self. . . . like a diverse but compact multitude, this whole world of mine, composed as it is of different people, projects but a single shadow, that of this calm figure who writes, leaning against Borges\u2019s high desk where I have come to find the blotter he borrowed from me.\u201d Whereas Roethke sang the soul\u2019s joy, Pessoa, working the same metaphor, hears his soul: \u201cMy soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, what fiddlestrings and harps, drums and tambours I sound and clash inside myself. All I hear is the symphony.\u201d Roethke presumably had to hear or feel his soul\u2019s joy before he could sing it, but he deployed the idea of a singular soul, whereas Pessoa describes his soul as a collective of musicians and instruments, paralleling his idea that the many selves inside of him lead to only one shadow. Our shadows are a part of us and not a part of us at the same time, which Pessoa recognizes when he says that \u201cSeeing myself frees me from myself. I almost smile, not because I understand myself, but because, having become other, I\u2019m no longer able to understand myself.\u201d Disquieting, indeed, to see the incomprehensible otherness within oneself, but also possibly joyful, to realize that one\u2019s own selves are an immense, possibly endless nation. Coming face to face with that imagined community of one\u2019s own self might be like the moment where Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh finds himself before the vast forest and can only shout in response. For me, writing is my way of quieting, for a while, that paradoxical disturbance of being aware of my simultaneous multiplicity and insignificance. When I have not written for some stretch of time, I become an irritable, unpleasant person\u2014disquieted. Writing is my discipline, my calling, my form of secular prayer that quiets me. I agree with what the writer Maryse Cond\u00e9 once wrote about writing, that it \u201chas given me enormous joy. I would rather compare it to a compulsion, somewhat scary, whose cause I have never been able to unravel.\u201d The otherness of the blank page elicits joy from the writer, even if the path to that joy can be arduous, even if that joy is fleeting and must be renewed with repeated confrontations with that blankness. The white page looms like an enigmatic face staring back at me, the face of an other that can elicit both terror and empathy, both murder and love, to paraphrase the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas. The confrontation with the other is not easy, should not be easy, but perhaps one thing that writing teaches me about myself is that if we ultimately could look with joy on our others, rather than with fear, anger, and hatred, then we could create something new. Ralph Ellison hinted at this possibility of transforming the self, in his case through writing. He said that \u201cthe trick here is that of creating one\u2019s identity through the medium of one\u2019s chosen art.\u201d Ellison was thinking of the challenges facing not only writers but Black writers, for whom identity cannot only be a matter of the singular self but always has some relationship to a Black world that is both joyfully chosen by many Black people and painfully imposed on them by white people and others. The poet Richard Wilbur articulates something similarly paradoxical when it comes to identity and writing, if the identity is that of being a writer. For Wilbur, \u201cWhen a poet is being a poet . . . he cannot be concerned with anything but the making of a poem. . . . psychologically speaking, the end of writing is the poem itself. . . . To quote Robert Frost again, \u2018You do more good by doing well than by doing good.\u2019 \u201d I agree, but where is the world in all of this, the world outside of the poem and the poet as much as the world inside the poem and the poet? Wilbur anticipates and responds when he says: And yet, of course, poetry is a deeply social thing\u2014 radically and incorrigibly social. . . . Writing poetry is talking to oneself. Yet it is a mode of talking to oneself in which the self disappears; and the product is something that, though it may not be for every body, is about every body. Writing poetry, then, is an unsocial way of manufacturing a thoroughly social product. Because he must shield his poetry in its creation, the poet, more than other writers, will write without recognition. . . . he is likely to look on honors and distinctions with the feigned indifference of a wallflower. Certainly he is pleased when recognition comes; for what better proof is there that for some people poetry is still a useful and necessary thing . . . like a shoe. I love this image of the poem as a shoe, the poem as both art and craft, inspiration and labor, useless and useful, the earthly sole that cannot avoid being grounded and trod on, and the spiritual soul that remains ever mysterious to us and to others. This is not a binary, this is a fusion, a pun, a play on words between the sole and the soul, with poetry and writing at their best when they play with words, a very serious matter requiring a light touch. Shoes are serious matters, as are poems, both requiring their makers to work with delicacy and discipline. Shoes are themselves light, but carry the weight of our entire bodies. Imagine poems as the shoes that the writer has cobbled together. Anyone can fit in those shoes. But in order for you to stand in those shoes, they must be empty. Full of nothing. When my own novels touch on the subject of nothing, some readers are disturbed. They do not understand that nothing is sacred. To say that nothing is sacred is sacrilegious, and it also means at the same time that we should revere nothing, from the vast empty expanses of the universe to the void within ourselves. From this paradox and contradiction in which nothing is in fact something, I find the unsettling, perplexing, tragicomic joy of otherness, ranging from my own individual, weird, idiosyncratic, unique otherness to the collective, systemic otherness projected onto me and my kind, whatever my absurd, negated kind is. Among my kind is the Vietnamese, the Asian, the minoritized, the racialized, the colonized, the hybrid, the hyphenated, the refugee, the displaced, the artist, the writer, the smart ass, the bastard, the sympathizer, and the committed\u2014all those out of step, out of tune, out of focus, even to themselves. \u2666 Excerpted and adapted from To Save and to Destroy: Writing as an Other by Viet Thanh Nguyen, published by The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

A longtime Zen practitioner, he currently works as a facilitator for the Zen In Prisons group and an in-prison teaching artist with the Williams James Association . In the following two poems, \u201cSlipstream Refuge\u201d and \u201cEulogy for Uncles,\u201d Wallin-Sato draws from the teachings of Dogen Zenji and Thich Nhat Hanh as he investigates themes of ancestors, identity, impermanence, and the passage of time. \u2014Eds. Slipstream Refuge I followed a mother coyote \u2013 black-tipped tail, auburn coat, paw prints stamped in Codrescu street cantos. Her pups amble across Elysian trail bends, hovered above the city skyline \u2013 an open window my mother shouts through \u2013 I hope you and your brother never get burned in life like me , her words float like cemetery canaries in the canopies. I will never be friends with your father , she whispers somewhere in Kyoto, the same year of my aunt\u2019s funeral in Tokyo suburbs; Buddhist monks sunken in old floorboards, an incense lit in the chest, 3rd ward, the mokugyo drummed in meter with breath and the last candle flamed across seven heavy weeks. We lost Thich Nhat Hanh this year , she says, traces her fingertips across rice paper, damp-ink kanji, we are all calligraphy , she speaks to the symbol for impermanence, water will wash us away. The city is my prison and the freeways are the jailers, inch-by-inch ascending the pass through the Golden Pagoda on Mei Ling Way \u2013 jadestone neon, bronze lotus postures, a thin scroll of Zenken kojitsu , the corners peeling from brick \u2013 an open doorway my mother shouts through \u2013 before the war your grandmother drowned , strong current, shadowed riptide, frothed crescent belly, she was saved by Mizuchi , the water dragon. Spirits filled my adolescence, stories sculpted across my mother\u2019s flesh like sutras; Kawa-no-kami, Raijin and Inari \u2013 tributaries, thunderstorms, sake. Foxes are earthly messengers, shape-shifters, handlers of aburaage offerings. Amaterasu signifies left eye, purified as sun, clutching heaven in place, a solar flare of jasmine.

He labeled them with the kanji \u76f8\u64b2 and nothing else. He told me the characters translated to strike one another like a match. He was born through fire. I had an uncle who was a high school football star in Japan. His yearbook titled him as lightning. I had an uncle who taught me how to properly eat futomaki. Not with chopsticks, but with our fingers. I had an uncle who collected chess pieces and cribbage boards. He played with a timer and I never was able to take his king. He laughed when I told him I made a cribbage board out of a sandal in jail. I had an uncle who restrung his Fender Stratocaster 100 times in one night. We played AC/DC licks and Deep Purple riffs until the sun rose over the valley. We continued to play until the sun set beneath the sand dunes and military barracks. I had an uncle who followed ghosts into broken windows. Portals from Okinawa to Atlanta to Carmel. I had an uncle who prayed to racecars and wore leather jackets with a fu manchu mustache. The cars were so loud at Laguna Seca Raceway that I thought the ground would swallow us into her belly. I had an uncle who painted the sides of B-52 bombers in his sleep. I had an uncle who remembers cities reborn after fierce American bombings. I never knew silence had a sound until he painted those memories. I had an uncle who retreated back into his mind and responded as if he were stuck behind a wall of glass. My mother says he lost all his powers when they moved across the Pacific. I had an uncle whose son was my best friend. We would build Gundam Wing models and pretend to shoot Kamehameha waves from our tiny palms. I moved to Oklahoma and he traveled to Nebraska and we haven\u2019t spoken since. The Midwest will do that. I had an uncle who collected Mangajin tapes and The Nikkei Weeklies. I had an uncle who renounced his Japanese citizenship in San Francisco. The morning was nothing but fog and the lonely cries of seagulls. That same month Led Zeppelin played The Forum, the Giants beat the Cardinals, and the occupation of AIM at Pine Ridge ended. My mother says they were asked about their criminal records, their English pronunciations, and why they wanted to become American citizens. I wonder how teenagers are supposed to respond to such interrogations. I had an uncle who worked at the post office for 36 years. His bedroom was filled with 42 US postal boxes. I know because I stacked them into shapes of castles while cleaning his room after he died. I had an uncle who would walk my brother to daycare while our mother cleaned houses. They would glide beneath cypress trees and listen to the waves crash against the lighthouse. Their neighbors were sea lions perched on protruding rocks and crescent-shaped beaches. I had an uncle who would criticize your cooking but I never saw him cook a meal. I had an uncle who was told to never speak Japanese. Once he was in America, he was told to write in white as his ethnicity. No one believed him. I had an uncle who was a reincarnation of a koto furunushi. He was able to play any song on a stringed instrument. I had an uncle who was a recluse. He would bring the world to him through world history catalogs and DIY kits. He charted the constellations and donated money to the Monterey Astronomy Center every month. I had an uncle who owned every anime movie, series, and magazine. He introduced me to living in a surreal imaginative landscape. I had an uncle who formed cirrhosis from drinking. I had an uncle who formed cirrhosis from a poor diet. I had an uncle who died in the afternoon while reclining in my baachan\u2019s living room. She never speaks of that day. I had an uncle who worked at Home Depot. I had an uncle who was fired from Home Depot. I had an uncle who could fix any car with a paperclip, bottle cap, and gorilla glue. His hands smelled of sesame oil and Marlboros. I had an uncle who rode a cloud in the twilight hour beneath coastal starlight. He was given a DUI for not stopping at a stop sign. My mother says when they moved to town, paved roads and stop signs didn\u2019t exist. I had an uncle who witnessed a demon assault his mother on an American GI base in Okinawa. Razor sharp claws and tentacles were pointed at both of their temples. My uncle wasn\u2019t yet three years old. I had an uncle who replaced his dreams with Kessler. I had an uncle who believed he was Republican because he wore stained trucker hats and was tired of being bullied. He never really understood American politics. Sometimes being regarded as the enemy forces one to support those who define foreign aliens. I had an uncle who loved to drive his pickup truck through the snow in Tahoe. A charming landscape reminiscent of winters at Zama Yatoyama Park. I had an uncle who was a wanted man. His posters were painted with supernatural apparitions. Yokai with multiple eyes, translucent bodies, frog legs, big noses, bigger balls, and nine tails. I had an uncle who was praised for being born a son. While he was awarded, my mother was scolded. I had an uncle whose job was to take care of his aging parents. He separated medicines and waited at eye appointments. He drove his mother to the salon every week. I had an uncle who paid the first month\u2019s rent at my halfway house. Without him, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this. He never judged me for living inside of a needle. I had an uncle who scattered his father\u2019s ashes out at sea while I sniffed cocaine below deck. I had an uncle who had the power to ease my mother\u2019s stresses when her relationships sunk to the ground. Maybe he didn\u2019t leave those abilities in Japan like my mother thinks. I had an uncle who read my first books of poems. Not for content, but to fix the grammar and syntax that editors missed. I had an uncle who loved to eat abalone and steak on the waterfront. I had an uncle who could cause an earthquake by stomping on the ground. But his steps were so light you couldn\u2019t hear him walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I had an uncle who looked like young Toshiro Mifune. I had an uncle who looked like old Sonny Chiba. I had an uncle who kept a wooden Asian lion in a box. Sometimes late at night, I could hear a deep growl echo through the hallways. I had an uncle who didn\u2019t know how to convey emotion. But he would cry every time watching The Sound of Music. He never said I love you, but would give you the shirt off his back if you asked him. I had an uncle who brought home onigiri every Friday after school. That day was the day he was allowed to converse in his native tongue. I had an uncle who didn\u2019t like my father. There are only so many times one is forgiven for forgetting to pick up their child. Then there is the realization that he never shows up at all. I had an uncle who did like my father. They drank Bud Light and partied on Cannery Row together. My father never forgot about a party. I had an uncle who never noticed his son moved out of the house. He would talk to the wall until everyone went to bed. My mother said he was able to see what others weren\u2019t able to see. She placed rose quartz and obsidian in all four corners. I had an uncle who paid for my plane ticket to go back to our homeland. Instead of joining me, he went to Hawaii. My mother said that was the happiest she had ever seen him. I had an uncle who one morning never woke up. I\u2019d like to imagine he found a secret tori gate and entered through it at dawn. I received the call at 4 am and rode a dragon down the highway. I had never seen someone so peaceful when we viewed his body. My baachan never let go of my hand while she rested her head upon his chest. My mother helped carry his spirit through the window. The Heart Sutra was chanted until the moon cast the Buddha\u2019s shadow across the temple. Thank you for subscribing to Tricycle!

      "content_text": "Personal Reflections Bridging Family and Community Practice Making space for children at the dharma center By Mariana Restrepo Oct 06, 2025 Photo by Sudhakar Chandra My Buddhist practice has taken many forms\u2014from initial academic study to lived experience as a practitioner. I\u2019ve sat with university groups and practiced in traditional Theravada and Tibetan monasteries, both in Asia and in the United States. I\u2019ve lived in mountain retreat centers, been active in urban dharma communities, sat through extended retreats, and even spent time as a monastic. For the past six years, though, my practice has been shaped by family life. I have a 6-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter who have been immersed in Buddhist practice and culture since birth. At home, they love spending time in what they call \u201cThe Buddha Room,\u201d watching my husband and me as we practice. They delight in making offerings at our shrine, helping to set up water bowls, lighting incense, and repeating mantras. Recently, my older one asked for his own Buddha statue and water-offering bowls, which he now uses for the small altar he\u2019s created in his bedroom. We\u2019re fortunate to belong to a center that offers diverse programming and genuinely welcomes families\u2014the resident lama has always made a point to integrate children into community practice, rather than segregating them into separate activities. A few weeks after my children were born, we held their refuge blessing ceremonies at the center, formally introducing them to our sangha. Over the years, they\u2019ve developed their own rhythm at events: sitting with us for a while, then wandering off to the community area to color, play, or grab a snack whenever they need a break. Like many Western dharma centers, ours has a core group of steady members alongside others who come and go, some staying months, others years. At any given event, there are usually people present who aren\u2019t familiar with my children\u2014a dynamic that is generally fine but can also create uncertainty about how people will respond to their presence at the dharma center. One particular incident brought this tension into sharp focus. It had been a challenging week for my family. Rain kept us indoors, leaving the kids restless and me feeling frayed around the edges. Still, we were looking forward to participating in the final session of a weekend event at the dharma center. While a formal dharma teaching or meditation retreat would, of course, be inappropriate for children to attend, participants in this event would be chanting, circumambulating the main shrine, and playing traditional Tibetan instruments. I was hoping that this would work well for my energetic children\u2014lots of sound, movement, and the rhythm of instruments\u2014minimizing any potential disruption. We arrived with the children, excited but still carrying that cooped-up energy from days of rain. Despite my attempts to keep them settled, there came a moment during one of the impromptu teaching segments when my children, who had joined my husband and me on our meditation cushions, began whispering to each other. Someone in front of us turned around and delivered a sharp \u201cshush!\u201d Suddenly, I found myself managing multiple layers of difficulty: my husband\u2019s discomfort with this negative attention, my own uneasiness about disturbing others, and the ongoing challenge of keeping the kids settled. On top of that, I now had to absorb the reactions of those who seemed annoyed or disrupted by my children\u2019s behavior. It was simply too much to carry all at once. We decided to leave. Whenever I can, I seize the opportunity to practice as a family. I could have let this experience end there, feeling frustrated and excluded. However, our community circled back to this incident later in the week. What followed were some truly meaningful conversations with dharma friends\u2014including the person who had been triggered by my children\u2019s noise, as well as the center\u2019s lama\u2014about inclusion within the sangha. By exploring broader questions about holding space for kids in Western Buddhist communities,\u00a0 these conversations made me realize why it\u2019s so crucial to practice both as a family and in community life. To Practice as a Family As a full-time working mother, finding time to practice is incredibly difficult. It requires juggling priorities and making use of stolen moments. So, whenever I can, I seize the opportunity to practice as a family. At home, our shrine room has an \u201copen door policy.\u201d I don\u2019t keep my children out. While it\u2019s set up as a traditional Tibetan shrine room filled with delicate items that small hands could easily break, I\u2019ve made deliberate choices to welcome them in. Both kids have their own meditation cushions where they can sit with us if they choose. When we make daily offerings, I include them\u2014letting them help set water bowls or offer incense. We often bring special rocks or feathers from our family walks to place on the shrine, turning our time in nature into part of our spiritual practice. On special occasions, I encourage them to make their own offerings through dancing or singing to the buddhas, watching their natural joy become part of our practice. Having my children not only observe my husband and me practicing, but actually participate in the practice itself, feels essential. I want them to grow up seeing dharma as part of their lives rather than as something that happens around them but doesn\u2019t include them. I want our practice to be a shared family experience, not something we disappear to do behind closed doors. This integration at home makes it all the more important to me that we\u2019re able to practice together as a family in community settings as well. To Practice in Community I want my children to experience practice in community\u2014not just as something we do at home in isolation. I want them to practice alongside others, and to witness and be part of a sangha. The goal isn\u2019t that my kids become Buddhist per se but that they learn about kindness, compassion, generosity, and helping others\u2014the things we cultivate as Buddhists. They need to see that these qualities are not just abstract concepts we talk about at home but ways of being in relationship with others, and that these values extend beyond our Buddhist community to all people.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b I want my kids to know that wherever they go, whoever they encounter, they can always build community. They have the capacity to find and create connections with others, to recognize shared values and humanity, and to cultivate belonging no matter where life takes them. Practicing in a community also provides opportunities for them to learn how to behave in a dharma center. This learning process isn\u2019t possible if we don\u2019t allow them to attend, and it\u2019s equally important that they see how people react when they make mistakes and how we can support one another through those moments. I believe a dharma center should be a constructive place. I don\u2019t want my children to develop negative associations with dharma centers\u2014places where they\u2019re constantly being told \u201cno\u201d or getting in trouble for simply being children. This isn\u2019t the association I want them to grow up with. Instead, I want them to see dharma centers as welcoming spaces. Shifting the Western Buddhist Model Dharma centers in the West often create quiet, sanitized environments where everything feels controlled\u2014you sit down, you\u2019re silent, and you practice within carefully maintained boundaries. While some centers do wonderful work offering children\u2019s programming and family-friendly approaches, there\u2019s often still an underlying divide between \u201creal\u201d practice\u2014the quiet, adult-centered kind\u2014and the \u201cchildren\u2019s activities\u201d that happen elsewhere. This sterile approach can create a significant gap in our practice. When our practice consists only of sitting on the cushion in controlled environments, we struggle to carry it into the real world. Our practice can become disconnected from actual life, existing only in highly curated settings rather than informing how we interact with people and navigate daily challenges. This doesn\u2019t align with my experience in traditional Buddhist communities. In the gatherings I\u2019ve attended in Asia and within diasporic communities, children aren\u2019t an exception requiring special accommodation\u2014they\u2019re simply part of the fabric of community practice. I\u2019ve found myself holding babies I\u2019d never met, helping toddlers who wandered over during teachings, playing quietly with children while their parents practiced. Kids come and go, move around, and exist naturally within the space without anyone feeling disrupted or uncomfortable. It\u2019s just a different set of expectations about the nature of practice. I think something essential gets lost when we compartmentalize practice this way. When we create these separate spaces\u2014adults here, children there\u2014we miss opportunities to learn how to carry our practice into the messiness of actual life. If dharma centers were more integrated\u2014truly welcoming to families and all generations\u2014we\u2019d have training grounds for living the practice. Instead of practicing how to maintain equanimity only on a quiet cushion, we could learn to find it amid the beautiful chaos of real human interaction. Simple Steps Toward Inclusion The changes don\u2019t have to be dramatic. In dharma centers and gatherings, even simple acts of acknowledgment can go a long way toward making children feel included. Our resident lama will sometimes invite my son to recite the refuge prayer for everyone, or to light and offer an incense stick\u2014and I watch him light up with pride and a sense of belonging. These small moments of participation help children develop a sense of ownership and responsibility within the community. But it can be even more basic than that\u2014just acknowledging children\u2019s presence at the beginning of an event can shift the entire dynamic. When a teacher takes a moment to say something like, \u201cWe have some young practitioners with us today, and they might move around or make some sounds as we practice together, and that\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d it changes everything. It gives parents permission to relax, and it helps other practitioners adjust their expectations before anything even happens. I\u2019ve noticed that much of people\u2019s discomfort around children isn\u2019t really about the noise itself\u2014it\u2019s about worrying what others might think about the noise. Once we communally acknowledge the situation and agree that some sound and movement is part of our practice together, it takes the edge off. People become more comfortable when a toddler wanders over during meditation or when they whisper (or even scream!) during a teaching. The children stop being a distraction and become simply part of a living, breathing practice community. The sangha is one of Buddhism\u2019s three jewels for a reason. I love practicing with my family at home, but it\u2019s only through community that we can actually bring that practice into the larger world. In community, we become part of each other\u2019s practice\u2014learning how to both offer and receive support. Community also serves as a necessary mirror, reflecting the sticky points we still need to work on, those blind spots we can\u2019t see on our own. It gives us real opportunities to practice patience, generosity, and compassion. When we build welcoming spaces that include messy family life, we do more than just strengthen our own practice. We strengthen the future of Buddhism. Thank you for subscribing to Tricycle! As a nonprofit, we depend on readers like you to keep Buddhist teachings and practices widely available.
