      "content_text": "A Conversation with Tara Brach on Meditation, Emotional Healing and Spiritual Awakening. September 18th, 2025 \u00b7 by Dr. Vikas Shah MBE DL Tara Brach , a renowned meditation teacher, psychologist, and author, has long been a beacon of hope and inspiration for countless individuals seeking solace, healing, and spiritual growth. With her profound wisdom and compassionate guidance, Tara has helped people from all walks of life navigate the complexities of the human experience, transforming suffering into a path of growth, self-compassion, and inner peace. From her early days as a grassroots organizer and yoga practitioner to her time in an ashram and subsequent Buddhist Insight Meditation retreat, Tara\u2019s journey has been marked by a thirst for wisdom and an unwavering commitment to unconditional and loving presence. As the founder of the Insight Meditation Community of Washington, DC (IMCW), one of the largest non-residential meditation centers in the United States, Tara has cultivated a vast following through her podcast, which is downloaded over 3 million times each month. Her work in spreading mindfulness and compassion has extended to pressing global issues such as racial injustice, equity, inclusivity, peace, and environmental sustainability. In collaboration with Jack Kornfield , Tara leads the Awareness Training Institute (ATI) and the Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program (MMTCP), further expanding the reach of her teachings. As an author of several books , including Radical Acceptance, True Refuge, Radical Compassion, and Trusting the Gold, Tara continues to inspire emotional healing, spiritual awakening, and compassionate action in the world. In this interview, I speak to Tara Brach (meditation teacher, psychologist, and author). We discuss the role of spirituality in our lives, the power of meditation, how we can find our connection with the world, and with each other. Q: What is spirituality? [Tara Brach]: I\u2019d like to begin with the concept of evolution, as it\u2019s something I often reflect upon. It seems to be a part of our evolutionary journey to feel separate, living within the confines of an ego-driven narrative, experiencing a sense of limitation and disconnection from others. This leads to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, as well as a sense of superiority over non-human animals and the environment. Consequently, we violate each other, mistreat animals, and cause potential irreversible damage to our planet. In essence, we suffer from a mistaken identity, identifying ourselves as individuals rather than recognizing our interconnectedness. Through evolution, we\u2019ve developed the ability to sense connection, collaborate, empathize, and show compassion, gradually discovering our belonging to a larger whole. This realization is, to me, the core of spirituality \u2013 understanding the greater truth of who we are. Each of us has experienced this interconnectedness during moments of birth, death, art, nature, intimacy, meditation, prayer, or through activities like dance, music, and art. Various terms \u2013 oneness, wholeness, awareness, sacredness, divinity, god, spirit \u2013 all point to the same animating force or field of awareness. Recognizing that we are all part of this interconnectedness, we naturally develop a deep reverence and respect for the inherent value of all beings. To illustrate, I\u2019d like to share a personal experience from my college days. My future seemed set: law school, activism, fighting for change with the traditional us-versus-them mentality. However, I began attending yoga and meditation classes, which led to a transformative realization. One spring evening, I felt a profound sense of connectedness and understood that true change must come from this consciousness. I made a complete shift in my life, joining a spiritual community instead of pursuing law school. I\u2019ve since returned to activism, driven by the belief that the world is a part of us, and we should engage with it through a sense of care and unity, rather than division. This personal journey demonstrates how embracing spirituality and interconnectedness can significantly impact our lives and the way we interact with the world. Q: Does spirituality serve as a tonic, a consolation? [Tara Brach]: The more we recognize that we are the ocean and the waves represent different aspects of our being, the less any individual wave of difficulty will consume, overwhelm, or define us. We can remember that while these waves are a part of us, they do not encompass our entire existence. Interestingly, this understanding works in reverse as well. The more we open up to these waves \u2013 be it fear, anger, or other emotions \u2013 the more we discover our oceanic nature. In people\u2019s personal growth and maturation, I observe that both of these processes are happening simultaneously. Individuals gain a sense of belonging to something larger, and when they feel stuck, they learn to remain open and accept their current experiences, which in turn reveals their interconnectedness with the greater whole. Q: How can we access spirituality in our lives? [Tara Brach]: I\u2019d like to offer a metaphor to help illustrate our true essence, which I believe is the formless level of our awareness. This metaphor comes from Thailand and involves a colossal Buddha statue. The statue, not particularly aesthetically pleasing, had been loved by the local population for centuries. In the 1950s, it began to crack, and a curious monk used a flashlight to inspect the cracks. To his surprise, he saw a brilliant gold reflection. The monks then removed the outer layer, revealing one of the largest solid gold statues ever found. The belief is that this statue was covered in plaster and clay to protect it during times of conflict. Similarly, humans encounter difficulties and cover our innate purity, eventually forgetting our essential nature. We begin to believe that our personalities, our particular abilities or habits, are who we truly are, losing sight of the truth that lies beneath the surface. By intentionally cultivating mindfulness and compassion, we shine a light on these coverings, allowing for a porousness that helps us remember our true essence. When we bring our attention to these coverings, we realize that the gold within us is more representative of our true selves. In our daily lives, if we pay attention to whatever is appearing, we can find our way home. I\u2019ll share a personal example related to this. During the pandemic, I was teaching mindfulness and compassion, and many people reached out to me saying that the practice of RAIN was saving their lives. RAIN is an acronym for Recognize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture, and it helps individuals weave together mindfulness and compassion. When my mom came to live with me and my husband, I felt guilty for not spending enough time with her and anxious about not fulfilling my commitments. One day, after barely acknowledging my mom, I decided to practice RAIN. Recognizing my fear, anxiety, and guilt, I allowed these emotions to be present, investigated them with curiosity, and nurtured them with kindness. This practice created space for me to be more present and compassionate, ultimately helping me cherish the moments I had with my mom. Repeatedly practicing RAIN not only saved precious moments with my mom, but it also allowed me to reconnect with my true essence and be more present in my life. Q:\u00a0 Who is the you when i look at you? [Tara Brach]: That\u2019s an insightful question, one that leads us to consider how we can train people who view each other as enemies to recognize their shared humanity, vulnerability, and innate goodness. How can we facilitate this shift in perspective? I believe that the more we trust the \u201cgold\u201d within ourselves, the more we are able to see it in others. Everyone has their masks, displaying their fears and desires on the surface. Due to our negativity bias, it\u2019s easy to focus on the flaws or defenses in others. However, the more we train ourselves to see the goodness in others, the more we can recognize it. When we interact with others, we can either fixate on their anxieties or performance concerns, or we can attune our receptors to truly sense the genuineness, curiosity, and care within them. The choice is ours. Q:\u00a0 Do we need to experience trauma to unlock our connection with the world? [Tara Brach]: I believe we must confront the knots within our system, whether they stem from full-blown trauma or less intense emotional wounding. Our suffering arises from the unseen, unfelt, and unprocessed parts of our psyche, or the \u201cissues in our tissues.\u201d To awaken, we must work through these. We often frame emotions as negative, but it\u2019s important to recognize the intelligence within every emotion, even depression, fear, and hurt. Physical pain is essential as it calls us to care for ourselves, and emotions are there to help us survive and thrive. Fear warns and protects us from danger, while anger helps us overcome obstacles. These energies are life-loving expressions. If we push these emotions away, judge them, or fail to attend to them, they become taut and twisted. Imagine a hose with water flowing through it; if twisted, what happens to the flow? We must move through these emotions with awareness and compassion to reach sacred spaces, as represented by animal-headed deities in Buddhism and other Asian religions. When we encounter these deities with awareness, they untwist, freeing their pure essential energy to integrate and vitalize our entire system. A Buddhist myth involving Mara, a deity representing greed, hatred, and delusion, highlights this concept. When the Buddha would teach, Mara would appear, and his attendant, Ananda, would worry. However, the Buddha would calmly invite Mara to have tea, demonstrating the importance of befriending what\u2019s difficult. The key is learning how to have tea with Mara and embrace even the most intense energies. Q: Does life have a purpose ? [Tara Brach]: We must confront the knots within our system, whether they arise from severe trauma or milder emotional wounds. Our suffering stems from the unseen, unfelt, and unprocessed aspects of our psyche, which can be thought of as \u201cissues in our tissues.\u201d To awaken, we must work through these. Often, we label emotions as negative, but it\u2019s crucial to recognize the intelligence in every emotion, including depression, fear, and hurt. Physical pain is essential, as it signals us to care for ourselves, and emotions help us survive and thrive. Fear serves to warn and protect us from danger, while anger aids us in overcoming obstacles. These energies are life-loving expressions.

Encountering these deities with awareness allows them to untwist, freeing their pure essential energy to integrate and revitalize our entire system.

However, the Buddha would calmly invite Mara for tea, showcasing the importance of befriending what\u2019s difficult. The key lies in learning to have tea with Mara and embracing even the most intense energies. [Vikas: And can mindfulness help us understand this?] [Tara Brach]: I am aware that we\u2019re often conditioned to have a linear perspective on progress, constantly evaluating ourselves and our position on the map. It\u2019s common to use any system we engage in as another playing field for self-judgment, pushing ourselves, and playing out our personalities. This certainly happens in the world of meditation too. What I\u2019ve observed is that some people might be driven by a more superficial sense of grasping, which is inevitable. However, with mindfulness, the practice itself eventually shines a light on this. By continually asking just two questions \u2014 \u201cWhat is happening right now inside me?\u201d and \u201cCan I let this be with kindness?\u201d \u2014 we practice the basic awareness skill of paying attention to the present moment without judgment, with interest and friendliness. By maintaining this practice, we actually wake up out of the drivenness to get somewhere, and that\u2019s what\u2019s truly fascinating. Q:\u00a0 What is the role of mindfulness in our lives? [Tara Brach]: We spend an immense amount of time in virtual reality, hardly grasping how often our thoughts are somewhere other than in our senses and the present moment. The greatest gift of mindfulness is awakening us from the virtual world and immersing us in the immediate, enabling us to truly listen to sounds and genuinely see past the surface of our surroundings and feelings. This allows us to fully show up for our partners, children, friends, work, and service. As highly conditioned, habitual beings, we possess numerous unconscious habits of reactivity. Mindfulness enables us to witness and respond rather than react to these habits. A personal experience that stands out to me occurred in 2003, when the United States was preparing to attack Iraq. As I read the newspaper, I grew increasingly angry at the administration and the hawks driving us to war. I decided to practice newspaper mindfulness: naming the anger, feeling it in my body, and recognizing the fear and grief underneath. Eventually, I discovered a tender sense of care beneath it all. Instead of reacting with anger, I responded by joining a group of clergy and spiritual leaders to protest at the White House. Our signs reflected care for everyone\u2019s suffering, not just our own. We were arrested, but the spirit of our demonstration was one of care. Mindfulness allowed us to respond rather than react, ultimately changing the energy in the field. If practiced collectively, it could change the world. As the Dalai Lama once said, if all 8-year-olds were trained in mindfulness, there would be no more war in the next generation. The physicists describe it as that all of life comes out of this infinite field of possibility, like every moment is just emerging and dissolving into that, and part of us is resting in that creative, infinite field and we\u2019re not so consolidated with an identity of a particular form. Q:\u00a0 How can we come to terms with our own mortality? [Tara Brach]: There\u2019s a beautiful book titled \u201c How We Live is How We Die \u201d that captures a fundamental understanding found in all spiritual paths: every moment is a living and dying experience. When this interview concludes, it will be as gone as the ancient pyramids or the First World War \u2013 simply gone. Our ability to recognize the ever-changing flow and embrace its groundlessness is crucial. If we try to cling to a particular moment or force something to happen, it\u2019s like clenching our fist around a moving rope \u2013 we get rope burn. However, if we open our fists and rest in the changing flow, we discover something beyond it: the space of loving awareness from which everything arises and returns. Having recently lost dear people in my life, I can relate to the feelings of cherishing moments and facing the inevitability of loss. Approaching 70, with many friends in their 80s, your question feels incredibly relevant. The key lies in training ourselves to be open to groundlessness, allowing insecurity and uncertainty to exist, and embracing that as part of our experience. [bios] Tara Brach\u2019s teachings blend Western psychology and Eastern spiritual practices, mindful attention to our inner life, and a full, compassionate engagement with our world. The result is a distinctive voice in Western Buddhism, one that offers a wise and caring approach to freeing ourselves and society from suffering. As an undergraduate at Clark University, Tara pursued a double major in psychology and political science. During this time, while working as a grassroots organizer for tenants\u2019 rights, she also began attending yoga classes and exploring Eastern approaches to inner transformation. After college, she lived for ten years in an ashram\u2014a spiritual community\u2014where she practiced and taught both yoga and concentrative meditation. When she left the ashram and attended her first Buddhist Insight Meditation retreat, led by Joseph Goldstein, she realized she was home. \u201cI had found wisdom teachings and practices that train the heart and mind in unconditional and loving presence,\u201d she explains. \u201cI knew that this was a path of true freedom.\u201d Over the following years, Tara earned a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the Fielding Institute, with a dissertation exploring meditation as a therapeutic modality in treating addiction. She went on to complete a five-year Buddhist teacher training program at the Spirit Rock Meditation Center. Working as both a psychotherapist and a meditation teacher, she found herself naturally blending these two powerful traditions\u2014introducing meditation to her therapy clients and sharing western psychological insights with meditation students. This synthesis has evolved, in more recent years, into Tara\u2019s groundbreaking work in training psychotherapists to integrate mindfulness strategies into their clinical work. In 1998, Tara founded the Insight Meditation Community of Washington, DC (IMCW), which is now one of the largest and most dynamic non-residential meditation centers in the United States. She gives presentations, teaches classes, offers workshops, and leads silent meditation retreats at IMCW and at conferences and retreat centers in the United States and Europe. Tara\u2019s podcast is downloaded more than 3 million times each month. Her themes reveal the possibility of emotional healing and spiritual awakening through mindful, loving awareness as well as the alleviation of suffering in the larger world by practicing compassion in action. She has fostered efforts to bring principles and practices of mindfulness to issues of racial injustice, equity and inclusivity; peace; environmental sustainability, as well as to prisons and schools. She and Jack Kornfield lead the Awareness Training Institute (ATI) which offers online courses on mindfulness and compassion, as well as the Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program (MMTCP). In addition to numerous articles, videos, and hundreds of recorded talks, Tara is the author of the books: Radical Acceptance (Bantam, 2003), True Refuge (Bantam, 2013), Radical Compassion (Viking, 2019) and Trusting the Gold (SoundsTrue, 2021).

      "content_text": "Ideas Magazine | Openings The Myth of Separation Tara Brach and Konda Mason on plant-based eating Interview with Tara Brach and Konda Mason by Alison Spiegel Fall 2022 Konda Mason | Photograph by Aaron Wynia The American meditation teachers Tara Brach and Konda Mason follow a vegan diet because of their concern for animals, health, and the environment. But the underlying problem linking these concerns is what Mason calls the myth of separation\u2014that is, the distance we\u2019ve placed and the false hierarchies we\u2019ve created between ourselves and the planet, other species, and communities within our own species. If we focus instead on our interconnectedness, however, \u201cit becomes harder to create harm,\u201d Mason says. Brach and Mason spoke with Tricycle about why they feel plant-based eating is so crucial to the spiritual path. What does \u201cethical eating\u201d mean to you? Tara Brach (TB): Ethical eating is eating that causes as little harm as possible to other beings, to the earth, and to our own bodies. Konda Mason (KM): Involved in that is also education. Our culture hasn\u2019t necessarily educated itself in respect to food and the impact our eating has on the earth. So I think it begins with us in the home, with bringing about a conscious awareness of that impact. What personal experience impacted the way you see and respond to the suffering of nonhuman animals? KM: When I was growing up, my grandparents and parents had a small farm with animals that we raised. I loved being on the farm with animals, and I had a very hard time because I saw the link immediately that the meat on my plate was this animal I had been in touch with. It created a groove in my heart, and once I left my parents\u2019 house I became a vegan as soon as I could. TB: I did not put the dots together until I was in college and started doing yoga and meditation and getting more attuned. I joined an ashram when I was 21 years old and became a vegetarian, but it was over the years that my visceral sensitivity to the suffering of animals grew. I remember as a young mom teaching at a meditation retreat near the Blue Ridge Mountains. Every day during our morning meditation we would hear mother cows lowing from nearby fields, grieving for calves that had just been taken from them. Like all mammals, they have a deep mother-child attachment. I would listen to these heart-wrenching calls and imagine how excruciating it was for these mother cows to have their babies taken away. It opened me in a very direct way, and I stopped eating dairy after that. I went fully vegan eight years ago, but I was mostly vegan for decades before that. How do we get closer to the suffering when we\u2019re so far removed from the process? KM: It\u2019s awareness. It\u2019s hearing about and being exposed to other ways of eating. There are many reasons that people become vegan\u2014not just the rejection of animal cruelty, which is how I got there. The African American community is almost three times more likely to be vegan and vegetarian than other Americans, and many do so for health reasons. Or maybe climate change and the meat industry\u2019s huge impact on the environment is the door you walk through. This conversation is intersectional. As for animal suffering, we have been anesthetized by violence in this country, which was actually built on violence; violence is part of what we drink, watch, and eat every day. We have numbed ourselves to the violence that is inflicted on animals. But there are many beautiful organizations that are doing the good work to bring awareness, and we just have to keep educating. TB: The diversity of life forms brings beauty and health to our living earth. Yet the more we humans perceive difference, the more our conditioning to devalue others kicks in. This shuts down our compassion because we don\u2019t register the realness of others\u2019 suffering. Waking up our caring involves deepening our attention to the reality of others\u2019 subjective experiences. For example, in teaching, I might share what it must be like for, say, a pig to be imprisoned in a metal gestation crate. It can\u2019t turn around; it has open wounds; it\u2019s lying in its own excrement\u2014all this after being forcibly impregnated and having its babies taken away. They\u2019re supposed to be stunned unconscious before they\u2019re killed, but many of them are still alive when their throats are slit and they\u2019re submerged in boiling water. If we imagine our own beloved dog being treated like this, being herded to slaughter, how would we feel? Just try looking in the eyes of another creature and saying \u201cWe are friends.\u201d You realize this being\u2019s sentience and love for life and feel a natural connection. For me, this brings joy because I can never be alone if I know that I belong with other living beings. \u201cWe have numbed ourselves to the violence that is inflicted on animals.\u201d KM: This speaks to what I think of as our primordial issue: this myth of separation, and in that separation, the hierarchy we\u2019ve created. We\u2019ve separated ourselves from the earth and from other living species, and then made divisions within our own species. That is the opposite of belonging and the truth of interconnectedness. When we focus on being interconnected, it becomes harder to create harm. Looking at veganism from this perspective, it doesn\u2019t feel like the challenge it\u2019s often presented to be. TB: When we\u2019re aligned and feel a sense of belonging with the rest of life, and feel that our actions are on behalf of the collective, there is a sense of inner freedom and fearlessness. What is there to fear if you belong to the web of life? For myself, the reward of eating a plant-based diet has been that feeling of alignment. Tara Brach | Photograph by Jonathan Foust What about moderation\u2014or does compromise just relieve us from confronting the myth of separation? TB: When I invite people into this inquiry, I\u2019m talking about going in the direction of increasingly plant-based eating. Some people feel their health requires eating meat products. This is a difficult domain, because it so easily brings up defensiveness, guilt, and anger. So it\u2019s crucial for authentic open dialogue to step beyond judgment. Judgment only creates more separation. This is about inviting all of us to look honestly at our own behavior and our own impact. What would feel best, and how would I feel more aligned? How can I move in that direction with compassion toward my own being, and with patience, good humor, and clarity? KM: The meditation teacher Larry Yang, a good friend of ours, says, \u201cMay I be as loving and compassionate as I can be. If I cannot be loving in this moment, may I be kind. And if I cannot be kind, may I be nonjudgmental. And if I cannot be nonjudgmental, may I not cause harm. And if I cannot not cause harm, may I cause the least amount of harm.\u201d Can eating meat ever be an ethical choice? KM: Animals have an important role to play in farming when it\u2019s done correctly. Afro-Indigenous agriculture, also known as regenerative agriculture, engages with animals\u2019 natural ability to heal the soil. Managed grazing, where animals roam the fields and are grass-fed, brings life back from the toxicity of industrial farming, doing wonders for the soil and plants. The animals are still slaughtered for meat, but usually more humanely than in industrial meat production. Although I believe we shouldn\u2019t overproduce animals for meat eating, we can still benefit from the healthier soil and more nutrient- dense food that result from the natural relationship between animals and the earth. TB: Of course there\u2019s a lot less violence and suffering when meat is not sourced from a factory farm. But in the United States, about 99 percent of all meat and animal products come from factory farms, and the global figure is 90 percent. Given the economics and the amount of land that\u2019s needed to raise animals, and the increasing domination of factory farms, it\u2019s highly unlikely that there are enough small-scale farmers for people in most countries to go that route. I feel like it distracts us from the bigger inquiry: That is, what is best for our bodies, for nonhuman animals, and for the earth\u2019s body? Where\u2019s the least harm? What grows our sense of connection and non-separation? What makes cruelty to nonhuman animals and the planet a crucial area for our attention and response on the spiritual path? KM: I want to note that in many spiritual traditions a large part of how people practice involves sacrificing animals. We are not equating the cruelty of industrial meat production with these sacred rituals. Nor are we saying that people whose only available food source is animals should not feed themselves the way they do. However, these are exceptions, not the rule. Mostly, humans eat meat unconsciously, which supports the inhumanity we are speaking about. As we bring forward the spiritual dimension of our existence, we become aware of what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called \u201cthe interrelated structure of reality.\u201d That interconnection asks us to be kind, loving, and compassionate to all life on Earth. For me, it asks that I not eat, kill, or harm my fellow Earth mates. TB: I don\u2019t separate plant-based eating from any other compassionate action that we take to reduce the violence in our world. Human domination and cruelty toward animals is one of the most invisible domains in our consciousness when it comes to how we treat others. We need to wake up to our participation in all caste systems, whether it involves religion, race, class, or how we treat animals. Yet we really can\u2019t wake up from any of them fully if we don\u2019t wake up from all of them. You can\u2019t just exclude some part of life from your heart. So part of my spiritual practice is to see past the apparent forms in order to see the light, the sacredness, that lives through us all. Thank you for subscribing to Tricycle!

I am pleased and hopeful to see discussion about plant based eating in the Buddhist community. Reply Diane Bassett says: August 23, 2022 at 1:47 am Thank you for broaching this very important topic. Our cultural carefully shields us from the reality of what happens in the animal agriculture business, which is designed to prevent us from becoming aware of its intense and heartbreaking cruelty.  Becoming educated on what really happens in to these animals \u2014 and how unnecessary it is, given how easy it\u2019s become to adopt a healthy diet that doesn\u2019t include animal flesh or their eggs or their maternal milk (dairy)\u2014 is a great place to start.  I started years ago by reading John Robbin\u2019s classic, Diet For A New America.  Gene Bauer\u2019s Farm Sanctuary is also great. I appreciate the invitation that Konda and Tara present to us to examine this topic in light of our ethics and commitment to non-violence. Great article. I would like to see more on this topic.

      "content_text": "Meditation Training Wheels Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach think qualified meditation teachers are needed now more than ever, so they\u2019re building a global community and curriculum to help Interview with Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach by Alison Spiegel Mar 29, 2022 Teachers Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach When Jack Kornfield and Tara Bach started a meditation teacher training program together in 2016, 300 students gathered for an in-person program on the West Coast. Today, over 4,000 people in more than 70 countries have participated in what has become a robust and ever-developing online community. \u201cAfter 45 years of teaching and training , this is one of the most exciting and rewarding things I\u2019ve ever done as a teacher,\u201d Kornfield says of the Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program . The program consists of a two-year course of study built around meeting in small groups, whether that\u2019s for workshops, discussion, or mentoring. The whole second year is a practicum where teachers-in-training go out and practice while receiving supervision. Applicants must have participated in Kornfield and Brach\u2019s Power of Awareness course , completed at least one retreat, and meditated regularly for at least five years. As Kornfield explains, students must have a foundation that will sustain them through what he calls a demanding two years, where students typically spend a minimum of five or six hours on the program per week. Importantly, students are not learning in a retreat setting but participating while living their everyday lives. Tricycle caught up with Kornfield and Brach to learn more about how two of the country\u2019s leading meditation teachers are bringing decades of experience to new formats and new subjects in the world of mindfulness meditation teacher training in order to meet what they see as an unprecedented moment in history. Alison Spiegel: Why did you start the Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program? Tara Brach: Our world is in a deepening crisis, and people are longing for an inner refuge of clarity, peace, wisdom and open heartedness. This means we need teachers who are trained to guide others back to presence, and to the compassion that can hold and heal our personal and collective suffering. There are a growing number of people from around the world who are drawn to offer this to their family, friends, clients, patients, colleagues, and communities. Jack Kornfield: People kept asking, \u201cHow do I find a teacher?\u201d So we founded the Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Program with the idea of creating a really high quality program that would give people skills to teach compassion and mindfulness practices in all kinds of circumstances\u2014from businesses to clinics to schools. AS: Why do you think there\u2019s a greater need now more than ever for qualified mindfulness meditation teachers? JK: It used to be that there was a Starbucks and a yoga studio on every corner, and now there\u2019s people teaching mindfulness everywhere. People can see that no amount of technology is going to stop warfare, racism, and climate change. There\u2019s a desperate sense in people that we have to live in a different way, that the outer developments need to be matched by the inner developments. Whether it\u2019s in our communities, families, or more broadly, we need a different way of being. There\u2019s a kind of freedom that the dharma invites people into, but it needs people who have experienced it in themselves. And that\u2019s why teacher training is so important. It allows those people to have those experiences and understandings so they can actually sit there with somebody in a hospital or in difficult circumstances and know how to make the mind peaceful. They sit with their own fears or grief and develop the capacity to have a freedom of mind and loving awareness that can hold it all. They learn deep compassion and how to be with the sorrows of the world or the struggles in their life. TB: We\u2019re at a time of unprecedented anxiety, loneliness, anger, hatred, grief, and depression. We need meditation teachers who not only can teach the basic practices of mindfulness and compassion, but who can also apply them to the incredibly difficult emotional states that people are struggling with right now. In any online class, there are going to be people who have lost parents to COVID, people who have great divides in their family politically, people who suffer from racial and religious violence, and those profoundly impacted by war. Collectively we are facing a threat to all life systems on our planet. Our world is calling for teachers who are able to be sensitive to this trauma and guide people on how to practice meditation in a way that can give resilience, balance, and a steady heart. There\u2019s a kind of freedom that the dharma invites people into, but it needs people who have experienced it in themselves. AS: What are some of the unique attributes and areas of focus of the program? TB: This teacher training is intentionally designed to support new teachers in bringing a healing medicine to our current divided and traumatized world. This means applying mindfulness and compassion to four domains: One is relational training\u2014teaching about mindful communications and conflict resolution.\u00a0 Another is how to customize trauma-sensitive meditation where needed. A third is our centering of diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEIA) throughout the entire training.\u00a0 And a fourth is engaged spirituality, which means expressing our inner awakening through \u201ccompassion in action.\u201d Each shifts the focus from an individual \u201cseparate self\u201d to realizing our collective belonging, and acting for the wellbeing of all. A key attribute of the program is its mentor-teachers. Our team is a wonderfully talented and diverse group of teachers who guide participants through all facets of the program with huge care, skill, and attentiveness. JK: The curriculum goes through the foundations of mindfulness, the four dimensions of the awakened heart; trainings of how to work with the body, pain, emotions, and thoughts; and a whole series of trainings on shifting from being caught in stories and self-destructive patterns to the possibility of inner freedom. But the beautiful thing is that people come in and make a deep community. Each of the close to 100 teachers we\u2019ve hired teach and mentor students in small groups that meet 25 times over the two years. Then there are peer groups, support groups, and affinity groups of different kinds. There\u2019s also a stellar guest faculty. Kristin Neff on mindful self compassion, Konda Mason, Eckhart Tolle, and Peter Levine on trauma, Earthlyn Manuel , and George Mumford. AS: You\u2019re always developing the curriculum. What\u2019s new this year? JK: In this last cohort, we\u2019ve made a really big and fantastic DEIA (diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility) training, which the world needs so much now. It\u2019s about how to really allow, in your community as a new teacher, the respect for and the inclusion of people of every background and every difference. It\u2019s so critical at this time and people are really grateful for it because of the diversity of teaching all over the world. One might ask, \u201cHow do I teach in a country where there\u2019s a caste system? How do I teach in a place where there\u2019s religious differences or racial differences?\u201d So we started to say, here are the underlying Buddhist principles of interdependence and inclusion, and here\u2019s how you actually use those to make a difference so that nobody is left out of the dharma. We learn from one another as much as anything else. So to be in groups, whether they\u2019re affinity groups for LGBTQ or BIPOC people, or people with disabilities, people are waking up and learning together. TB: Our focus on DEIA comes down to a very simple understanding that we can\u2019t awaken individually, or in our communities, unless we are aware of the ways we push others out of our hearts. This requires investigating how our society\u2019s conditioning has created biases in each of us that lead to devaluing and violating non-dominant populations. So it\u2019s an emotional, challenging, and powerful part of the training. In addition to a growing number of active affinity groups there are also opportunities for people to meet around different forms of social activism, like climate change , for example. And we have amazing line up of guest teachers, leaders, and luminaries addressing trauma, religious and racial violence, animal cruelty, and the deepest domains of spiritual freedom. AS: Can you talk more about the impact on your students, the teachers-in-training? JK: There\u2019s something magical about becoming a teacher and having to express what you\u2019ve learned in your heart and your mind that\u2019s made a difference to you. It clarifies it. It empowers it in you. I have a young mom with kids who are just getting into elementary school. She came from a very difficult family and was changed by the practices of compassion and forgiveness, and then she decided it was time to do something that mattered. So she went back to her children\u2019s school and she first taught the parents. Then the parents got so excited they started to change the curriculum of the school. So there was this parallel development of her coming into her own as a parent and confronting her own family history with this training and then teaching others. TB: We have students from around the globe bringing teachings to their communities\u2014to a women\u2019s clinic in Pakistan, to those struggling in Hong Kong and China, to support those devastated by COVID in Brazil, to doctors on the front lines in New York City. They share the gratitude they receive, and the deeply gratifying experience of being able to offer transformational teachings to people living with much suffering. And so many share about creating communities of practitioners, and the blessings of increasing connection when so many have felt isolated. AS: And how has the program impacted you? JK: I\u2019ll be 77 years old in some months and I\u2019ve been training teachers for forty years, and it\u2019s one of the most satisfying and rewarding things I\u2019ve ever done. This is on a scale I couldn\u2019t have imagined before we had all these online capacities. It feels like I\u2019m in a new phase of life that\u2019s not just teaching in retreat settings, but answering a different call, if you will, to make things available. There\u2019s a certain way that teaching used to be almost exclusive. If you knew people you\u2019d be invited into this special training program. And I devoted myself to that and loved it. But being devoted in this way with over 100 colleagues who are helping has really changed the game. TB: I started off with doubts because I\u2019ve taught live for many decades, and I had questions about a teacher training that involved so much depth and intensity as an online process. But what I found was that the degree of intimacy that\u2019s possible online\u2014in the mentoring groups, during the live online gatherings\u2014is so powerful that people report a huge degree of connection with each other. In fact, many mentoring groups from the first and second cohort are still meeting informally with each other, meditating together, some even having retreats. Plus there\u2019s huge energy around the emerging MMTCP alumni group as a supportive and ongoing learning community. So my doubts went away, and it\u2019s been so exciting and gratifying to see what\u2019s emerging. We take feedback and do a huge amount of creative revising and refining, and I know this will continue. And I love this program and community\u2026so many bright good hearted beings! Everyone who participates is part of its unfolding, and in the deepest way, serving the deepening of wisdom, compassion, and love in the world.

Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian Since suffering a miscarriage at a women\u2019s retreat, Tara Brach has tried to reform the world of meditation by arming its practitioners with a single weapon: self-compassion By Rachel Mabe Wed 8 Dec 2021 09.00 CET Last modified on Wed 16 Feb 2022 18.31 CET Share T ara Brach was four months pregnant when she miscarried at a women\u2019s retreat in Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico. She was 30, and had spent the last eight years as a devoted member of 3HO, a community promising spiritual awakening. The loss devastated her. She believed that extensive physical activity in the desert summer heat might have contributed to her miscarriage, so she wrote a note to her spiritual leader, Yogi Bhajan, suggesting they exercise care with pregnant women in the future. Bhajan waited until the next public gathering to respond. In front of a roomful of her peers and without previous warning, he sternly declared that no summer was hot enough to cause a woman to miscarry. He then called on Brach to stand up and \u201chear the truth\u201d. She had lost the baby, he said, because she was too worried about her career \u2013 and \u201cmotherhood is not a profession\u201d. Now shouting, he accused her of being a liar; he could tell she was one from her aura. \u201cYou wanted to have a child, that is true. Everyone knows that. Otherwise you would not have spread your legs,\u201d he spat. \u201cBut you got it, and then what?\u201d He told her she needed to go sit and \u201cwork it out\u201d. View image in fullscreen A garden Buddha stands in Tara Brach\u2019s garden. Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian Brach, in shock from the public humiliation, retreated to a little one-person meditation hut called a gurdwara, where she spent most of the night. Meditation in her ashram \u2013 which she practiced for several hours after meeting the day at 3.30am with a cold shower \u2013 focused on cultivating a \u201cstate of peacefulness, energy or rapture\u201d. This practice usually made her feel less distressed or anxious, if only temporarily, by pulling her out of her feelings. That night, she decided to try something else and forced herself to sit with her feelings of shame, sorrow and fear, instead of trying to escape them. After several hours of doing this, she asked herself if she was feeling bad because, as Bhajan said, she was bad, or because she had lost a pregnancy and had been abused by her spiritual teacher in front of her community. That moment changed everything. She started to listen to her body and her intuition, and came to the realization that the world of meditation had a serious problem with sexism and patriarchal practices. So she decided to do something about it \u2013 starting with self compassion. I n late September, I visited Brach at her home at the end of a dead end street in Falls Church, Virginia. Brach, 68, wore all black on her petite frame. Her wavy hair is the blond of a kid who spent the summer at the pool, evidence of her daily morning swim. Her simple appearance and earnest demeanor doesn\u2019t suggest the meteoric level of success she has reached as of late. Brach has become a spiritual leader trusted by members of the US Congress, where she has taught a workshop, and celebrities like Naomi Watts and Tamu McPherson \u2013 who both told Vogue that Brach saved them during the worst of the pandemic. She releases one guided meditation and one dharma talk weekly; more than 2.5 million people listen every month. As I settled in her screened-in gazebo, Brach wrapped me in a big white blanket, not wanting the morning chill to prevent us from being fully present with each other. It\u2019s important to pay attention to our bodies, she explained. We usually try to ignore cues because we live in a culture where success means conquering bodily and emotional experiences instead of listening to them \u2013 but the feelings never really go away, no matter how we try to cover them. If we were cold, we would spend the whole interview wishing to be somewhere else. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian She first experienced the stickiness of feelings in childhood, which she spent trying to save her mother from depression and alcoholism. Brach\u2019s mother appeared to be a high-achieving woman: she had graduated from college, traveled abroad and spent years working in advertising. But after getting married, she moved to East Orange, New Jersey, and had four children. As her world shrank, she retreated inside herself, armed with gin and murder mysteries. No one really paid attention to her sadness and self-loathing until Brach, by then a teenager, started drawing lines on her mother\u2019s bottles to track how much she drank. It took a couple of years before she was willing to go to rehab, and a few more before she managed to stay sober with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. By the time Brach left home, she had done her job and saved her mom \u2013 but she\u2019d also internalized some of her self-loathing, which she tried to fix with food, alternating between binging and dieting. In college, her plan was to become a civil rights attorney like her dad, but the reality of rallies and protests disappointed her. \u201cThey were adversarial and aggressive,\u201d she said. Instead, she found herself pulled towards the calm she experienced after her weekly yoga classes, which were taught on campus by 3HO members (the acronym stands for Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization). On her way home from yoga one spring night, Brach stopped to admire a fruit tree beginning to blossom, and realized that her body and mind were in the same place at the same time. Outside of experiences she\u2019d had consuming psychedelic drugs, she\u2019d never felt anything like the overpowering sense of belonging, connection and acceptance she felt under that tree. It was there that she realized where societal change needed to come from \u2013 not from courts, not from politics, but from our consciousness. She officially joined 3HO shortly after, and moved into an ashram outside Boston once she graduated. 3HO was started by Indian-born Yogi Bhajan in 1969. A charismatic leader, Bhajan was responsible for an array of rules that had to be followed by his disciples. Full members wore turbans and all white clothing (although members call themselves Sikhs, the group bears little resemblance to Sikhism). They had to practice several hours of yoga and meditation a day. They also took a vow of celibacy until they married, and were eventually given a spiritual name. Most also entered into marriages arranged by Bhajan himself. \u201cNone of us could see a reason for the matches he made,\u201d Brach told me. Even at the time, she balked at the hierarchy and the rigidity of having to marry someone chosen by a male guru, but she decided she couldn\u2019t say no; it was \u201cwhat the path required\u201d. In a ceremony held at the Espa\u00f1ola ashram, she married a man she barely knew alongside eight other couples. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian Two years after Bhajan told her that something was wrong with her for losing her pregnancy, Brach finally left. It was the only adult life she\u2019d ever known. Bhajan called and begged her to come back. When she refused, he became cruel, telling her she would be barren if she disobeyed. She did not tell him she was already five months pregnant. Her husband left with her. They had a boy they named Narayan. She taught meditation classes and finished a clinical psychology doctoral program; he worked for a landscaping company. They lived together for another five years before divorcing. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful person, but one I never would have chosen for myself,\u201d she says. Brach managed to escape 3HO, but many were not so fortunate. In 2019, 15 years after Yogi Bhajan\u2019s death, his longtime secretary, Pamela Dyson, published a memoir outlining his abuses. Dyson, who left the organization in 1984, sued Bhajan two years later, at the same time as Katherine Felt, another former devotee. Felt\u2019s testimony states she suffered imprisonment, rape and assault by Bhajan. The suit was settled out of court and followers were largely dismissive about the allegations until Dyson\u2019s book about her ordeal, published more than 30 years later, prompted others to come forward. 3HO commissioned an independent investigation that concluded that Bhajan had abused \u2013 sexually, physically, emotionally \u2013 dozens of members. (Leadership has said they won\u2019t erase Bhajan from their history, but he is no longer their moral and spiritual guru.) Brach became a Buddhist lay priest in 1988. Eventually, she joined the ranks of Buddhist meditation teachers with psychological training \u2013 and vowed to reclaim the intelligence of the body and the heart from what she experienced in the ashram, and from a patriarchal society that teaches us to dissociate from our bodies. I t\u2019s easy to see the problems with male-led religious groups like 3HO, but the secular Buddhist world that Brach transitioned to was not free of sexism or hierarchy either. More complicated still was the treatment of women within the Buddhist religion. The 14th Dalai Lama did say that a woman could be chosen as his replacement, but also, jokingly, that she would need to be \u201cattractive\u201d. He apologized for the comment in 2019, but it\u2019s a line he has gleefully repeated over the years. In 2010, he told a reporter that the first time someone asked him about the possibility of a female Dalai Lama 20 or 30 years before, he had said yes but then added that \u201cif she is an ugly female, she won\u2019t be very effective, will she?\u201d An apology written on his behalf said that he had always been supportive of women\u2019s rights, missing the point that repeating this joke for decades affected the tone and culture of Buddhism, both religious and secular. As the late Buddhist feminist scholar Rita Gross wrote in a 2014 paper titled The Suffering of Sexism: Buddhist Perspectives and Experiences , Buddhism has a real problem with \u201cthe sexism of male dominance\u201d. \u201cTraditional Buddhists ... readily admit that women are disadvantaged in general and in Buddhist institutions. That is because to be born a woman is an unfortunate birth, the result of negative karma from previous lives. Thus, it really isn\u2019t unfair that women are so disadvantaged and nothing can be done about it except for women to be good girls.\u201d Even the story of the Buddha perpetuates patriarchal gender dynamics. In order to achieve enlightenment, the Buddha had to leave behind all his earthly attachments, including his wife and son. Enlightenment, then, is not available to women who create and care for children, as spiritual awakenings are separate from daily life. While some types of meditation require practitioners to completely detach from earthly concerns, \u201cmindfulness meditation in the West has never been that\u201d, Christopher Germer, a clinical psychologist who lectures at Harvard\u2019s Medical School told me. \u201cAs it is understood in the US, it is primarily the practice of regulating attention.\u201d This often takes the form of focusing on one thing \u2013 like our breath, or counting to 10 repeatedly \u2013 and returning to it every time attention wanders. Stepping outside the stream of emotion, and focusing on the present moment, helps one to return to life calmer and better equipped to deal with distress. Brach\u2019s brand of meditation focuses on compassion towards emotions during meditation. Germer explained the difference between the two approaches like this: \u201cMindfulness helps us regulate emotions through regulating attention, while compassion regulates difficult emotions through care and connection.\u201d View image in fullscreen Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian Emily Tanner, a 34-year-old international affairs professional living in Charlottesville, Virginia, found Brach after her husband came home one night and unexpectedly told her that he wanted a divorce. In her desperation, she read and listened to anything she could find tat might help. Brach resonated most. \u201cI always thought I was supposed to feel completely better after meditation, but Brach\u2019s approach taught me that meditation does not have to mean a calm response to emotions,\u201d Tanner told me. She primarily learned this through Brach\u2019s \u201clittle acronym\u201d Rain, which moves through four steps \u2013 recognizing difficult emotions, allowing them to be there, investigating them with curiosity and nurturing them with love. During these meditations, Tanner sat on her bed or couch and brought feelings of despair, shame, failure and rage to mind when Brach asked her to. She then told herself they were valid: \u201cI stopped fighting them and really started feeling them.\u201d When prompted to examine where they lived in her body, she found that anger and fear manifested as tension in her upper arms, shoulders and chest, and sadness as a hollowness and pressure in her chest and shoulders. The final step of nurturing was usually the most difficult \u2013 and the most powerful. She put her hands on her heart, or sometimes wrapped herself in a hug and whispered aloud, \u201cIt\u2019s OK, it\u2019s OK, it\u2019s OK, you are OK, you are OK, you are OK.\u201d The practice not only helped her understand her situation intellectually, but also showed her a way to start healing from her pain. Self-compassion as the approach to mindfulness, rather than a result one gains from it, is a relatively new concept. In 2003, Kristin Neff, professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas, published the first empirical study on self-compassion. It may sound obvious now, but the study found self-compassion to be a good alternative to self-criticism, which tends to make people feel worse about themselves, and self-esteem, which often includes more of a false puffing up. Self-compassion, a term most participants had never heard of, allowed them to see their flaws clearly and move towards addressing them. \u201cAt the time there was very little written about it, so I based my work on Buddhist models of compassion and then turned it inward for self-compassion,\u201d Neff told me. That same year, Brach published her first book, Radical Acceptance. When Neff read it, she thought: \u201cShe\u2019s the one, she\u2019s the spiritual teacher who totally gets what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d We are wounded in relationship, and we are healed in relationship Tara Brach Neff says there was a lot of resistance to the concept of compassion in the male-dominated mindfulness world \u2013 something she experienced first hand. About 10 years ago, a prominent mindfulness researcher humiliated her at a conference. \u201cHe was so dismissive. He said, \u2018Mindfulness already includes the heart, you know, it\u2019s already there.\u2019 But it\u2019s different when you make it explicit, when you put your hand on your heart and you say, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re hurting. Is there anything I can do to help?\u2019\u201d Brach and Neff paved the way for women like Emma Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, author of The Happiness Track and the science director of Stanford\u2019s Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education . In her role as faculty director of Yale School of Management\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Program, she focuses on teaching self-compassion because women in the male dominated world of business often view themselves with self-criticism, \u201cwhich they falsely believe leads to self-improvement\u201d. David Saunders, a psychiatrist who has a PhD in Buddhist studies, told me that all types of mindfulness share the goal of reducing suffering. Whether the best way to do that is by cultivating compassion first with awareness following naturally, or attention first with compassion following naturally, is one of the questions that has been \u201cwrestled over and wrestled with since Buddhist thought and practice began\u201d. These approaches are not at odds. Mindfulness (or awareness, or wisdom) and compassion (or love, or warmth) are often thought of as two wings of one bird in Buddhist philosophy, Brach told me. You need both to fly. \u201cWe all have the same foundation. We\u2019re training our mind to notice what\u2019s happening and regard it with compassion. The difference is what we\u2019re emphasizing,\u201d she said. Brach and Neff also emphasize connection \u2013 with our hearts, minds, bodies and each other. \u201cWe are wounded in relationship, and we are healed in relationship,\u201d Brach said. For a long time, Brach\u2019s relational healing came through family, friends, clients, students, peers \u2013 and her son. Only at 50 did she find a healing romantic relationship. She met Jonathan Foust at a conference where they were both speaking. He sat near the front while she led a meditation and found himself distracted by how attractive she was. He recalls her saying \u201cwhatever thoughts you\u2019re having, make room for them, they\u2019re OK.\u201d So he did. They have been together since. Healing has been a byproduct of their relationship \u2013 they have remarkably similar pasts, which includes ashram living, arranged marriages, and having to readjust to regular life. But their healing is also an explicit and ongoing practice. They meditate together twice a week and discuss what feels good about their relationship, and what needs attention. Foust told me he used to feel terror when Brach would look at him and say \u201cwe need to talk\u201d, even though he knew it would be good for them. For her part, Brach knew that she sometimes used language indicating a serious talk as a controlling move. The regular check-ins have changed everything. Like formal meditation, it\u2019s a way to hold space for \u201cwhatever presents itself\u201d, she said, before going back to being tender and open. \u201cWhen we really listen in order to understand, we end up with more intimacy, more care.\u201d Explore more on these topics Gender Women Meditation Health & wellbeing features Share Reuse this content",

Credit: Malte Mueller/Getty Images/fStop Take a deep, long breath, because you probably need one this week. Which week is it again? The one with Hurricane Ida, a Category 4 storm , that wiped out power for weeks in New Orleans . The one where the U.S. ended a 20-year war in Afghanistan but left behind vulnerable Afghans who may die at the hands of the Taliban now that America is gone. The one where a major wildfire in California crossed the towering Sierra Nevada mountain range and threatens thousands of homes in Lake Tahoe , not to mention the surrounding wilderness. Let's not forget the continued spread of the Delta variant, which may lead to another 100,000 deaths in the U.S. between now and December , the vast majority of those fatalities preventable with a vaccine some people refuse to take. Next week it may be a different combination of disasters, fueled by climate change, geopolitics, conspiracy theories, and other forces that are well beyond our personal control. While catastrophe is part of the human experience \u2014 no matter how hard we try, we cannot keep tragedy or death at bay \u2014 the news finds us faster these days, on our phones and on social media. The pandemic, which began 18 long months ago, shifted our collective existence so that now any difficult development compounds the relentless uncertainty and grief, especially for those who experience new crises firsthand instead of watching them unfold from afar. Of course, happiness still prevails when possible. We find ways to move through the day with the coping skills at hand. But what these disasters require of us is more than the emotional equivalent of treading water. Instead, they demand what psychologist Tara Brach has written about and promoted for nearly two decades: radical acceptance. Brach describes the concept thusly: \"Radical acceptance is the courage to face and accept reality, our current experience, what's happening now.\" What radical acceptance offers I asked Brach how to practice this skill as we face yet another wave of crises. To skeptics, the idea of accepting this week's events may seem like a recipe for more pain, if they mistake the notion of acceptance for condoning what's transpired or remaining passive about it. But when applied correctly, the approach offers a way forward during tumultuous times. Brach, a meditation teacher and author of Radical Acceptance: Embracing Your Life With the Heart of a Buddha , says radical acceptance is born of two capacities: mindfulness and compassion. Mindfulness is simply the ability to recognize what's happening inside us right now, particularly observing and naming emotions as they arise. When compassion is employed, there's a quality of \"open heartedness\" about those inner experiences, says Brach. She sometimes likes to frame radical acceptance as a question: What's happening right now inside me, and can I be with this with kindness? \"What's happening right now, and can I be with this with kindness?\" If the answer is no, that's OK, says Brach. Radical acceptance also means accepting what we can't accept in that moment. For the person in the sweltering New Orleans heat, who has no electricity and cannot bear sitting with their fear and discomfort, radical acceptance wouldn't have them embrace the situation. Rather, it gives permission to acknowledge when something is too much to process in any given moment. Mashable Trend Report Decode what\u2019s viral, what\u2019s next, and what it all means.

Thanks for signing up! A critical benefit of the practice is to help return someone from the state of fight, flight, or freeze , when stress hormones are coursing through their body and their \"primitive survival\" brain has taken over. This evolutionary stress response has its role, but when left unmitigated can drive us to make poor decisions rooted in feelings of panic and anger, among other emotions. We might neglect ourselves in important ways, such as going without sleep, or lash out at others. When we turn to radical acceptance through mindfulness and compassion, it interrupts the mind and body and directs them away from an alarmed state. Time to slow down That transition cannot happen without what Brach calls the sacred pause. Slowing down enough to register our emotions and greet them with a gentle presence is a prelude to radical acceptance. Finding this stillness is undoubtedly hard when we're facing a firehose of information that includes everything from media coverage to calls for help from people trapped in their attics during a hurricane or scrambling to evacuate a wildfire. Doomscrolling and doombrowsing make radical acceptance impossible. Instead, put the phone down and turn the computer off. \"Speed ends up undermining our capacity to access our resources,\" says Brach. \" The speedier our world, the less we actually listen to feelings, the less we process information in a useful way, the more we get caught in stereotypes, the more we get caught in our own unseen biases...we don't really think things through.\" This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. Brach says that when she's gripped by powerful emotions like anger and blame, often triggered by hearing about someone powerful who is perpetuating social injustice or racism, she tries to pause and make a \"U-turn.\" Instead of focusing on how the person is bad or wrong, she returns to her internal feelings with mindfulness, in an effort to understand what's motivating them. Underneath the anger, for example, is fear, which is undergirded by grieving for the suffering she sees, and beneath that is caring. \"If we can get back to the caring, then we can actually respond in a way that is useful in the world,\" says Brach. How we get in our own way Sometimes the path to radical acceptance is blocked by our own feelings of inadequacy. Brach says we may feel a sense of failure when stressed, then subsequently become stuck in anxiety or confusion. We might feel as though we've not helped enough or made the wrong choices. That contributes to what Brach calls the \"trance of unworthiness,\" or a pervasive sense of personal failure that can undermine our relationships, our creativity and capacity at work, and our ability to enjoy life. That state of feeling deficient propels us forward on a \"chain of reactivity,\" where our actions are dictated by our insecurity rather than a \"wise presence.\" SEE ALSO: After COVID-19, we're going to need more than therapy At the same time, those feelings of inadequacy can prompt us to deploy judgment and blame, whether it's targeted at ourselves or others. Brach says those are common ways people try to organize the chaos before them, in an effort to gain control. If we judge ourselves harshly, or do the same to others trying to survive a crisis, it provides momentary order but no genuine relief. It also separates us from others. Brach says that by pausing and recognizing the feeling of falling short, then practicing radical self-acceptance, we can cultivate courage, compassion, and resilience that helps us respond to challenges with greater intelligence. Radical acceptance reminds us that we're not alone If the process of radical acceptance seems intimidating, Brach has created a version of the acronym RAIN (recognize, allow, investigate, nurture) comprising the basic steps to follow. Those steps can be followed in the moment of feeling distress, or later when there's an opportunity to reflect. Even one minute spent using the acronym (a \"light\" RAIN) can make a difference, says Brach. When feeling anxious, for example, the response could be as swift as quickly recognizing and naming the anxiety, allowing the experience to be without judgment or trying to ignore or change it, investigating a clenched chest with interest and care, and nurturing with self-compassion. The nurturing doesn't need to be elaborate, either. Simply putting a hand on the heart in that moment, saying kindly that it's OK, can be enough to gently acknowledge the toll. When we reconnect with the caring beneath our emotions, we're better able to take care of ourselves and work with others, empathizing, collaborating, and problem-solving in times of need. (See, for example, the people who donated millions of dollars last week to Afghans in crisis .) Without that clarity and presence, we forget that others are experiencing similar pain, which leaves us feeling isolated and reactive. \"As soon as we remember our togetherness, we have all the resilience in the world,\" says Brach.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. author of Chained to the Desk in a Hybrid World: A Guide to Balance. Follow Author Jun 15, 2020, 09:35am EDT Jun 15, 2020, 10:44am EDT Share Save This article is more than 5 years old. Tara Brach, Ph.D., world leader in the field of meditation and compassion Photo compliments of Tara Brach During the global pandemic and racialized unrest, we all need pathways to calm, clarity and openheartedness. While it\u2019s natural to feel fear during times of great collective crises, our challenge is that fear easily takes over our lives. Mindfulness and compassion practices can help us find an inner refuge and deepen our loving connection with each other. Studies show meditation can improve well-being at work and lead to happier, healthier and more productive employees. And more corporate heads are jumping onboard the meditation train. Sharat Sharan, CEO, President & Co-Founder of ON24, a San Francisco-based marketing technology company, touts the advantages of meditation to stay calm because personal health and energy are passed down to your team: \u201cAfter the great recession, I started meditating and now begin every day with 12 minutes of meditation. That routine has helped me stay mindful, pragmatic and put out positive energy. In the midst of a crisis, you need to personally embody the attitude that you want your team and your own business to demonstrate.\u201d Psychologist Tara Brach, Ph.D ., author of Radical Acceptance and True Refuge and one of the leaders in the world of meditation, agrees. I had the distinct privilege of catching up with Brach to ask her about the benefits of meditation during these extraordinary times whether we\u2019re working from home or in the office. Tara Brach leading one of her meditation classes Photo compliments of Tara Brach Bryan Robinson: Let\u2019s talk about the importance of meditation as the world is going through the pandemic and racial injustice. Tara Brach : Year\u2019s back Omar Bradley, chair of the Joint Chiefs Of Staff said, \u201cOurs is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.\u201d When there\u2019s this spike in fear we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s important that we have a way of being with that fear that allows us to open our hearts. That\u2019s the opportunity of these times\u2014that we can come through it with more compassion, more caring for each other. Meditation helps with that. If we don\u2019t have meditation and we get that spike of fear, we go into reactivity\u2014into fight-flight-freeze. The stats emerging are showing increases in addictive behaviors, domestic abuse, people stockpiling frantically, confusion, depression and so on. Meditation is a way to come back home to a calm refuge inside where we can respond to what\u2019s going on with more intelligence and heart. MORE FOR YOU Robinson : Yes, our lizard brain fears can run rampant when we\u2019re threatened. Brach: At times like this, our conditioning is to run away from our vulnerability. If ever there\u2019s a time that we use meditation and the courage to be present with ourselves and to know how to calm ourselves and be real with ourselves and each other, I think that\u2019s the opportunity. Robinson : For people who might not be familiar with meditation, the idea of taking time out and going within might not strike a cord. What would you say to them? Brach : Perhaps the handiest way to think about it is we know physical exercise is what we need for a healthy balanced body. Meditation is a mental training that gives us access to our resources like mental clarity, creativity, compassion and empathy. And it takes training but not a huge amount of training. In fact, we know if somebody puts in five or ten minutes a day, there\u2019s a growing momentum of a pathway back home again. We\u2019re working with neural pathways, changing the habitual neural pathways that leave us anxious and reactive and finding pathways that let us access the more recently evolved part of our brain. It doesn\u2019t have to take long, It\u2019s an intentional training, and it has science behind it. Robinson: So how does meditation help with workplace stress, COVID-19 and all of us who are working remotely from home? Brach : I think we all have anxiety about failing\u2014performance anxiety, and the workplace is where it gets played out in a way that has high stakes for us. To have tools for how to work with the different emotional reactions that come up at work is critical if we want to function well. When we\u2019re stressed, it triggers our survival mode, the most primitive part of the brain into getting protective, aggressive, defensive and critical. If we have the tools of meditation, when we get triggered we activate the prefrontal cortex\u2014the more recently evolved part of our brain and have access to our executive functioning, rational mind and our heart\u2014our kindness. Robinson : And that ushers in compassion. Brach: Exactly right. When we\u2019re in fight-flight-freeze, we don\u2019t have the perspective that includes what others might be going through. It cuts off our empathic capacities. So meditation enables us to look through the eyes of another person. I often use this metaphor for the workplace. You\u2019re out in the woods and see a little dog. You go over to pet it, and it lurches at you with its fangs bared. You get angry but then you see one of its legs is in a trap. Then you shift from being angry to feeling compassion, although you still don\u2019t go near it because it could still bite you. But your heart has shifted. Everyone we meet is struggling hard in some way. Instead of feeling like a victim of others or jumping into blame, if we could pause enough to ask, \u201cHow does that person have their leg in a trap?\u201d When a colleague isn\u2019t responsive, not holding up their part or acting snippy, maybe somethings going on at home or they don\u2019t feel well. Or maybe they\u2019re anxious about a deadline. In other words, if we could enlarge our perspective, we can respond in a way that can move the relationship forward. Meditation let\u2019s us pause enough so we can enlarge our perspective. Robinson : It stops us. Brach : It requires interrupting a pattern. That\u2019s what meditation does. It interrupts whatever pattern we\u2019re in. Robinson: So what about someone who ruminates or who has obsessive thoughts? Could you speak to the role meditation plays? Brach : If we\u2019re anxious, we\u2019re going to be caught in thoughts. The way we try to solve our problems is by circling thoughts. It doesn\u2019t help, but this is what we do. One of the central trainings in meditation is learning the skill of recognizing \u201cthinking as thinking\u201d and having the choice to come back to some present-moment sensory experience. The most common is the breath. Or it might be sounds, the feelings in the body in the sitting posture or a set of words. That gives enough of a perspective that \u201cthinking is thinking\u201d so we don\u2019t have to believe our thoughts. The biggest gift that comes from meditation for many people that really changes their lives is, \u201cI don\u2019t have to believe my thoughts. I\u2019m not my thoughts.\u201d With obsessive thinking, if there\u2019s a possibility of noticing them and telling your anxious thinking mind, \u201cThank you for trying to protect me, but just in this moment I\u2019m okay.\u201d Then go right back to what\u2019s actually here, and we start finding a refuge inside. Neuroscience shows that emotions such as fear and anger have a life of about 1.5 minutes, yet the reason they lock in is because we keep perpetuating them with our thoughts. So getting the knack of being able to notice the thinking and come back to the present-moment can shift our entire emotional experience. Robinson : And that brings in the concept of neuroplasticity. Brach : We know that the brain is plastic. Let\u2019s say you have a pattern of getting anxious about performing, going into circling thoughts, and because of the thoughts and anxiety, making a lot of mistakes. That pattern is grooved in the brain. If you can begin to notice, \u201cOkay, this is an anxious thought,\u201d then take a few deep breaths and come back into the body, in those moments of interrupting that pattern you\u2019re beginning to introduce a new neural pathway. With practice, you can change the whole pattern of anxious thinking and living to one where you have much more stillness, calm and perspective. Robinson : Could you walk through the RAIN meditation process? Brach : The R of rain is to recognize ; the A of rain is to allow what\u2019s there; the I of rain is to investigate ; and the N of rain is to nurture or bring compassion to what\u2019s there. By way of example, I worked with a woman in a new job where she was highly qualified but intimidated by the CEO who was short-tempered and brusque. She would go to weekly meetings and feel anxious and not able to bring forth all she had to offer. We trained in RAIN. Before she went into the meeting, she would recognize how anxious she was and mentally whisper the word \u201canxious.\u201d If you note the emotion, it activates the prefrontal cortex and calms down or reduces the strength of the limbic system. The A of rain is allow, which doesn\u2019t mean I like this. It means I\u2019m willing to pause and let it be here, not judge or fix it. The I of rain is investigate\u2014somatic, not cognitive. You find where it\u2019s living. For this woman it was  a squeezing, twisting in the chest. I often encourage people to put their hand where they feel it to bring attention to it. So instead of running away, you\u2019re investigating and staying with the experience. For her, the fear needed to be accepted that it was there. The N of rain is to nurture. She let the hand on the heart be a comforting, loving touch, and she sent the message to her fear that this belongs. And it\u2019s okay. That gave her more space, and she did that before each of the weekly meetings. She was able to develop a pathway back to her natural intelligence and clarity that was being covered over by her anxiety. Robinson: How does meditation help with self-judgment? Brach : I recognized the trance of unworthiness in myself in my twenties. I realized there could be no freedom unless I could accept myself just as I was. I\u2019ve been working on bringing compassion and mindfulness to self-judgment for a long time. The first thing for people to know is that it\u2019s utterly pervasive in our culture. We\u2019re given all these standards. In order to be an acceptable, lovable person you need to look this way, act this way and have this kind of intelligence to be successful. Every one of us can spend many moments feeling as if we\u2019re falling short of the standard. The first step of waking up from the trance of unworthiness is simply recognizing, \u201cOh wow, this is a pervasive pattern in this body and mind of thoughts and feelings.\u201d And to get that it\u2019s not just me; it\u2019s all of us. Making a commitment in advance for self-compassion makes a difference, knowing in our intuitive wisdom, we can be more of the person we know is possible when we get in the habit of self-kindness. Robinson : How does meditation help us react to a boss or colleague who is attacking us or upset with us? Brach : The inner practice that can give us the most strength, intelligence and empowerment is the U-turn\u2014shifting our attention from \u201cOh, that bad, attacking, aggressive boss\u201d\u2014from what they\u2019re doing wrong to what\u2019s going on inside when this is happening. We might feel anger back at them. Then we find out what\u2019s under the anger which is probably fear or hurt, so we feel that. In other words, be honest with what comes out and nurture that with self-compassion before we respond to the person. If we respond right when we\u2019re triggered, we\u2019ll perpetuate a cycle of hostility and reactivity. But if we make the U-turn, get in touch with ourselves and bring self-nurturing, we respond from our whole resources with a lot more strength, clarity, intelligence and compassion.Usually when people are acting out, something is going on in them. And we\u2019ll see how they have a leg in a trap. Tara Brach joins Resiliency 2020 on Zoom September 10, 2020. You can register for the free live-streaming webinar at resiliency2020.com.

      "content_text": "Radical Compassion in Challenging Times Handling Worry with RAIN Tara Brach Magazine Issue May/June 2020 Share A few days ago, a friend emailed me a cartoon, a picture of Sisyphus working at home on a laptop with a huge boulder by his side. The reality is, it\u2019s not life as usual for any of us. This unfolding global crisis is toppling every routine and plan in the books, small and large, so it\u2019s been interesting in the last few days to ask, What matters? What really matters? How can we face the fears that naturally circle around this pandemic in a way that opens our hearts? Whether your fear is for yourself or for others close to you, or even for our world in a larger sense, our nervous systems are clearly getting the immediacy of the crisis. No one\u2019s exempt. We\u2019re part of this living web in crisis, and a huge number of us will feel real loss, hardship, and heartbreak. We all know that pandemics are toughest on those who are most vulnerable, those with the least money, least access to resources. If they survive the virus, they\u2019re likely to be financially devastated. But while we can feel the vulnerability around us with raw fear and agitation, we can also feel the possibility that in some deep way, what\u2019s unfolding can wake up more loving, more compassion in the world. This is the potential that we have in front of us right now. As my friend Valerie Carr says, this is truly a time to know that no one is a stranger. For many years, I\u2019ve been practicing this prayer from the Buddhist tradition: \u201cMay whatever circumstances that arise serve the awakening of compassion.\u201d Whatever circumstances. So my hope in these times is that this pandemic calls forth love that awakens this heart and all hearts. I invite you to ask yourself: In facing this collective suffering, what\u2019s your heart\u2019s deepest aspiration? What do you hope might be called forth in you? How do you want to be? Who do you want to be in the midst of this? There\u2019s a teaching from Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh about a time when a crowded refugee boat met with a storm. If everyone panicked, all would\u2019ve been lost. But one person on the boat remaining calm and centered was enough to show the way for everyone to survive. How can we be that one person? I think a weave of mindfulness and compassion can transform our relationship to fear and worry, so we can shift toward inner calm. The very word worry comes from an Old English word meaning to strangle. While it truly is a dangerous time, the looping thoughts of worry actually trap us in the kind of fears that interfere with our executive functioning, making good decisions. They interfere with our capacity to feel compassion for others. They interfere with a larger perspective that allows us to move wisely on our path. But mindfulness gives that capacity back. In the meditation practice of RAIN, we can directly apply compassion to fear, so we can come back to a place of centeredness and tenderness, as opposed to reactivity. Each letter of RAIN is a way to work with our body, mind, heart. In short, the R of RAIN is recognize , meaning that we know what\u2019s happening right here. We name the emotion: fear, worry, agitation. The second step is to allow , which means there\u2019s an intention to let be for right now, to not fix or judge or ignore. Allowing gives us a pause. As Viktor Frankl said, \u201cBetween the stimulus and the response, there\u2019s a space. And in that space is your power and your freedom.\u201d So allow opens a space. Now especially, when fear has a tight grip on us, we need to continue on with the I in RAIN, which is to investigate , to bring a gentle and curious attention to what\u2019s here. The biggest misunderstanding with the I of RAIN is that it\u2019s cognitive, but it\u2019s about 90 percent somatic, in that we\u2019re primarily trying to discover and feel and fully contact the emotion as it lives in our body. Investigating is what sets the groundwork for the N, nurturing . As we investigate, we get more in touch with vulnerability, and the whole mechanism of compassion is that if we can touch the vulnerability, a natural tenderness arises. So we nurture from that tenderness. We actively offer care to our inner life. We can put our hand on our heart because so often it helps to offer that care through touch. We might have certain phrases of comfort we use, or an image of a loving being. When you investigate, you\u2019re going to find certain questions to pose to that vulnerable part of yourself. What do you need? How do you want me to be with you? That will help create the contact, the nurturing. When we get to nurturing, we\u2019ll each find our own phrases that speak to the particular needs of the vulnerability inside us. For many years, mine was, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart.\u201d Just that simple. I\u2019d put my hand on my heart and say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart. Come home to love.\u201d The nurturing dissolves the sense of a separate scared self. It lets us feel the belonging that\u2019s so healing. Evolutionary psychologists have a wonderful saying that it\u2019s not the survival of the fittest: it\u2019s the survival of the nurtured. That nurturing allows us to feel the kind of belonging that frees up the grip of fear because fear is the perception of separation, loss of connectedness. When we think of what a child most needs, it\u2019s to be seen and loved. RAIN is a kind of a spiritual reparenting, where we recognize and allow what\u2019s here and bring it a real tender nurturing. Then the end of the process is what I call After the Rain. It\u2019s where the real gift lies. If we pause and just notice the quality of the presence that\u2019s emerged, we can sense the shift from when we started, the frightened self or the agitated self or victimized self, to a space of radical compassion, which is compassion that\u2019s embodied. It\u2019s an act of caring, and it\u2019s all-inclusive. It\u2019s a sense of being in loving awareness that allows us to hold all of the streams of pain, the world\u2019s fear in our hearts. The good news is that it\u2019s a pathway that becomes more natural and spontaneous the more we do it. And it doesn\u2019t have to take long. You can do a light RAIN, and you can teach your clients to do it. In times of global crisis, we need practices that are accessible and easy to remember\u2014and that we can do with others online or over the phone. It\u2019s a way we can find an inner refuge of love in ourselves. What do you hope might be called forth in you? How do you want to be? Who do you want to be in the midst of this crisis? But how do we then bring that love and compassionate presence to others? There\u2019s a saying that originally was attributed to Buddha: it\u2019s that our fear is great, but greater yet is our connectedness, our belonging, our oneness. If we can remember and take refuge in that, we have room for fear. As we know, a huge amount of research shows how our connecting reduces fear. If you hold a loved one\u2019s hand, parts of the brain correlated with fear and agitation quiet down. So if ever there\u2019s a time for a refuge in our sense of community with each other, however we cultivate it, it\u2019s now, and that connection is going to have the vastness and depth and tenderness to hold what\u2019s going on. I heard a story about a little boy who was scared during a thunderstorm. He kept going into his parents\u2019 room, and they\u2019d put him back to bed in his own room. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, you\u2019re fine, God is with you,\u201d his father kept saying. After a number of rounds of this, the little boy said to his father, \u201cI know God is with me, but I want someone with skin on.\u201d We need beings with skin on. We need the connecting. In contrast to natural disasters like earthquakes and so on, a pandemic can be a setup for disconnection. We start to fear that others are a danger to us, which is exacerbated by the physical distancing and the competition for scarce resources. Historically during pandemics, people have been so terrified that they\u2019ve been unable to take good care of each other. The exception is in the heroism of healthcare workers, of course. But what we\u2019re finding now is that we can counter that dread and awaken love in each other. I think what we\u2019re evolving to understand in a cellular way is that we all want nurturing, we all want to love and be loved, we all want to feel safe. This is truly the time to realize that nobody\u2019s a stranger. If we can see the vulnerability that each person is experiencing, then we\u2019ll remember to extend our natural care. And yet, we forget. It happens all the time. Each one of us gets caught in our own experiences of hurt and fear. And in those moments, we\u2019re unable to reach out. There\u2019s a well-known saying: everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. So we need to remind ourselves we can bring radical compassion to our world in three ways. The first is by reaching out and connecting, really connecting, in different ways. Lots of people are having Zoom dinner parties. A friend of mine is even going to Zoom dance parties. The second is being of help to others, which helps us reconnect with our sense of resilience and empowerment. So reach out to someone who\u2019s lonely; contribute time. In Ireland, what took off through Twitter was an initiative to look out for elderly people who needed medicine and food, and match them with volunteers. And the third is by celebrating the goodness that\u2019s here. Please walk outside. The beauty of spring will lift you up, the dearness of those that you might be at home with. So many people really want to serve the good. In China, truck drivers risked infection to bring desperately needed food to the people of Wuhan. In Iran, videos showed doctors in scrubs dancing to keep people\u2019s spirits up. It\u2019s happening all over that we\u2019re being true to the pain while remembering the goodness. Richard Hendrick, a Catholic priest in Ireland, recently wrote a poem called \u201cLockdown.\u201d It goes like this: \u201cYes, there is fear. Yes, there is isolation. Yes, there is panic. Yes, there is sickness. Yes, there is even death. But, they say that in Wuhan, after so many years of noise, you can hear the birds again. They say that after just a few weeks of quiet, the sky is no longer thick with fumes, but blue and gray and clear. They say that in the streets of Assisi, people are singing to each other across the empty squares, keeping their windows open so that those who are alone may hear the sounds of family around them. .\u00a0.\u00a0. All over the world, people are slowing down and reflecting .\u00a0.\u00a0. waking up to a new reality, to how big we really are, to how little control we really have, to what really matters, to love.\u201d At times, when things fall apart, as they are in our world right now, each of you has an essential medicine to offer. So that inquiry\u2014Who do you want to be? And what kind of world do we want?\u2014becomes critical. Just as there\u2019s a viral contagion, it\u2019s crucial to remember that loving presence is contagious. We have this opportunity to find our inner refuge and deepen our kindness and connection with others. In many different ways, we\u2019ve all been training for this, to hold this living dying world in our hearts and to respond with compassion and love.

In her latest book, \u201cRadical Compassion: Learning to Love Yourself and Your World with the Practice of RAIN,\u201d she offers an antidote to stress and anxiety in an easy-to-learn, four-step meditation that quickly loosens the grip of difficult emotions and limiting beliefs.

It\u2019s this week\u2019s Sunday Paper Exclusive Offer, and it features our own Maria Shriver! 1. Why is this book so important for this day and age? If you fly cross-country, it\u2019s more than likely that the person sitting next to you either meditates or has a close friend who practices. Mindfulness courses are in our schools, businesses, hospitals and the halls of Congress. We humans are at an amazing juncture in our evolutionary journey\u2014never in our history have so many people been intentionally cultivating states of mindfulness, clarity, balance, and kindness. Meanwhile, we\u2019re fast destroying our larger body, the earth, and live in a society filled with contempt, mistrust, and hostility. Sadly, even those trying to be more mindful, find themselves caught in creating others into the bad guys, the enemy. And on an individual level, we are often at war against ourselves, fueling feelings of deficiency and unworthiness. The medicine we most need, personally and collectively, is compassion. We need to see the fear and vulnerability in ourselves and others and respond with care. In the deepest way, we need to refuse to push anyone, including ourselves, out of our hearts. Only then will we recognize and act from the truth of our mutual belonging. Radical Compassion introduces the RAIN meditation as a powerful spiritual technology for cultivating compassion in the face of difficult emotions. Through the acronym RAIN (Recognize-Allow-Investigate-Nurture) we can awaken the qualities of mature compassion\u2014an embodied, mindful presence, active caring, and an all-inclusive heart. I\u2019ve now taught this mode of practicing RAIN to hundreds of thousands of people, and am regularly told, \u201cThis has changed my life.\u201d 2. Can you explain the RAIN meditation? The four steps of RAIN are easy to learn and can be brought to any experience of emotional difficulty. R\u2014Recognize What\u2019s Going On Recognizing means consciously acknowledging, in any given moment, the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are affecting us. You might notice a critical inner voice, feelings of shame or fear, the squeeze of anxiety or the weight of depression in the body. Recognizing can be a simple mental whisper, noting what has come up. A\u2014Allow the Experience to be There, Just as It Is Allowing means letting the thoughts, emotions, feelings, or sensations we have recognized simply be there, without trying to fix or avoid anything. When we\u2019re caught in self-judgment, letting it be there doesn\u2019t mean we agree with our conviction that we\u2019re unworthy. Rather, we honestly acknowledge the arising of our judgment, as well as the painful feelings underneath. I\u2014Investigate with Interest and Care Once we have recognized and allowed what is arising, we can deepen our attention through investigation. To investigate, call on your natural curiosity\u2014the desire to know truth\u2014and direct a more focused attention to your present experience. You might ask yourself, What most wants attention? How am I experiencing this in my body? What am I believing? What does this vulnerable place want from me? What does it most need? Whatever the inquiry, your investigation will be most transformational if you step away from conceptualizing and bring your primary attention to the felt-sense in the body. N\u2014Nurture with Self-Compassion Self-compassion begins to naturally arise in the moments that we recognize we are suffering. It comes into fullness as we intentionally nurture our inner life with self-care. To do this, try to sense what the wounded, frightened or hurting place inside you most needs, and then offer some gesture of active care that might address this need. Does it need a message of reassurance? Of forgiveness? Of companionship? Of love? Experiment and see which intentional gesture of kindness most helps to comfort, soften or open your heart. You might find the message of kindness deepens if you lightly place your hand on your heart. If it feels difficult to offer yourself love, bring to mind a loving being\u2014spiritual figure, family member, friend or pet\u2014and imagine that being\u2019s love and wisdom flowing into you. Nurturing can come from any imagined source. \u201cAfter the RAIN\u201d When you\u2019ve completed the active steps of RAIN, it\u2019s important to just notice your own presence and rest in that wakeful, tender space of awareness. The fruit of RAIN is realizing that you are no longer imprisoned in any limiting sense of self. Give yourself the gift of becoming familiar with the truth and natural freedom of your being; it is mysterious and precious! 3. Can you share a story from your book that shows us how the practice and teachings of RAIN works? In a far-off land, word spread far and wide of a holy man with magic so powerful it could relieve the most severe suffering. After seekers of healing traveled through the wilderness to reach him, he\u2019d swear them to secrecy about what was next to pass between them. Once they took the vow, the holy man asked a single question: \u201cWhat are you unwilling to feel?\u201d Learning to directly face anxiety and fear with the RAIN meditation gives you a pathway to inner transformation and a fearless heart. After a daylong seminar on RAIN and stress, \u201cBrianna\u201d came up to me and asked for some help with a personal situation. She\u2019d recently been hired as a marketing vice-president in a large corporation, but she felt intimidated by the CEO, who was very quick to cut off anyone who was \u201cwasting his time.\u201d He ruled over the weekly staff meetings, which Brianna described as \u201ctorture\u201d that put her into a state of \u201cbrain freeze.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be worried about my competence,\u201d she said. \u201cI was recruited because I got an industry award at my last job. But the atmosphere here is totally different\u2014really corporate, and the other VPs pretty much ignore me. I just go back to my office with my stomach churning and wonder how long I\u2019ll last. I suggested that Brianna practice RAIN for a few minutes right before each meeting and asked her what was going on for her at that time. \u201cOn those mornings I can really feel the anxiety building, and it lands me in a frenzy of busyness\u2026reviewing reports, marking what I might need to comment on\u2026nothing really productive.\u201d I smiled because I recognized that feeling all too well. \u201cOkay, so before you start RAIN, imagine you\u2019re pressing the pause button on that frenzy.\u201d Brianna closed her eyes and pictured herself at her desk, a half-hour before the weekly meeting. \u201cAs you pause,\u201d I said, \u201c your first job is to Recognize the anxiety and Allow it to be there.\u201d After she nodded, I added, \u201cNow, what do you notice if you bring your attention and interest to how it feels in your body?\u201d Beginning to Investigate , she muttered, \u201cDry mouth . . . really tight chest. . . heart hammering. . . and, oh yeah, my stomach\u2019s in knots.\u201d I suggested she place her hand on her abdomen and send her breath there with a long slow inflow and outflow. This would to help her steady her attention and stay in contact with the fear. Now I guided her to ask the scared place inside her what it needed most, a key inquiry in Investigating. After a moment, she looked up, surprised. \u201cIt said,\u00a0\u2018Let it be ok that I\u2019m here.\u2019\u201d So the Nurturing that scared place needed was to be accepted, not to be made \u201cwrong.\u201d I asked Brianna how the wisest, kindest part of her wanted to respond. Could she find a way to acknowledge this very vulnerable part of herself with compassion? She sat quietly, still breathing slowly, her hand on her belly. Then she nodded. \u201cI just sent the message \u2018It\u2019s ok\u2026this belongs.\u2019 And\u2026it does feel more ok. I\u2019m actually a bit more relaxed.\u201d This became Brianna\u2019s RAIN practice each week before going to the staff meeting. And when she felt anxiety spiking during the meeting, she\u2019d simply breathe into it and send the message, \u201cIt\u2019s ok\u2026this belongs.\u201d About three months later, Brianna updated me. Her tension around the CEO hadn\u2019t disappeared, but her anxiety had lessened somewhat. More important, it didn\u2019t feel like such a big deal. \u201cI\u2019m not so alarmed when I get anxious,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was fighting it so hard, but now it\u2019s ok that it\u2019s there. That really does free me up.\u201d \u00a0She also shared some real progress in making creative contributions and connecting with others. Asking yourself, \u201cwhat am I unwilling to feel,\u201d can open you to deep spiritual healing. Fear is the feeling that something is wrong and that, rather than facing it, we need to act to protect ourselves. When, instead, we have the courage to pause and meet fear with the mindfulness and compassion of RAIN, our awareness and wisdom enlarges. If we need to respond to a threat, we\u2019ll do so\u2014with increased balance and presence. But often we\u2019ll see: \u201cIt\u2019s just anxiety, it\u2019s ok. This belongs\u201d\u2014and begin to unhook from a lifetime pattern of reactivity. While fears continue to arise, we have access to a heartspace that is open and free. 4. Can anyone practice RAIN? While anyone can practice RAIN, it becomes stronger when people have a mindfulness practice, as that helps cultivate a focused, present-centered and non-judgmental attention. Also, if someone has PTSD and feels at risk of triggering a traumatic reaction, it\u2019s important to explore this meditation with a therapist. More generally, with very intense emotions, it\u2019s best to precede RAIN with a period of Nurture\u2014some mode of self-soothing and calming. This creates sufficient safety and balance to move through the steps of RAIN and experience healing. 5. What do you hope readers will get from reading your book? This book guides us to love ourselves into healing; to bring self-compassion to the wounded parts of our own being. It also invites us to feel our belonging to all of life, and to actively express our care. There is tremendous happiness and peace in feeling ourselves as part of the healing of our world\u2014seeking to end the bias, oppression and violence towards those human and non-human animals who are most vulnerable, and together working toward the healing of our precious planet.

For many of us, self-judgment comes a lot easier than meeting ourselves with compassion. Our inner critic can be such a bully, hijacking our ability to connect with others, express ourselves, and experience joy. But, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We turned towards internationally renowned meditation teacher, Tara Brach, to develop a Calm Masterclass on developing self-compassion. It's full of wisdom and everday practices to transform the way we work with difficult emotions. We recently sat down with Tara Brach to learn about her mediation journey and ask her for a few tips about developing compassion. Here\u2019s our inspiring conversation. Why is compassion so important? If you fly across the country, it\u2019s likely that the person sitting next to you either meditates or has a close friend who does.

Once they took the vow, the holy man asked a single question: \u201cWhat are you unwilling to feel?\u201d Radical goes to the roots: We awaken the living roots of compassion by learning to bring a gentle presence to the difficult feelings, like fear, shame and grief, that we habitually avoid.

This loving attention naturally extends to all of life\u2014feeling our belonging, and actively expressing our care. Can you explain RAIN?

      "content_text": "Scroll To Top How to Go Through Life with Love in Your Heart A Q&A with Tara Brach about offering radical compassion to yourself and others. By Eve Ekman | \n        January 28, 2020 Print Bookmark How do you react to difficult emotions like anxiety, guilt, or anger? Many of us have the habit of judging ourselves and others harshly, drawing lines of blame that separate us from each other. But there\u2019s another way, writes internationally recognized meditation teacher Tara Brach in her new book. Radical Compassion is a way of practicing acceptance and care for ourselves and others that allows us to stay present to all that life brings and stay connected to each other. Her main tool for cultivating radical compassion is RAIN , where we Recognize, Allow, and Investigate whatever is troubling us\u2014be it the crippling anxiety after our first breakup or the tenderness and guilt of white privilege\u2014and Nurture ourselves with self-compassion. Advertisement X Keep Up with the GGSC Happiness Calendar Make the world a little better this month A psychologist and bestselling author, Brach draws upon her own experience with family, health, and the events of the world alongside her work as a psychologist to provide clear examples and tools for applying ancient spiritual practices to everyday life, from our most challenging emotions to our deep personal relationships. Many of her exercises draw on themes of self-compassion , loving-kindness , and reappraisal, all of which have been found to support well-being. For me, all of Brach\u2019s books (and podcasts) feel like trusted friends I can call upon when I am feeling caught up in unhelpful, self-focused rumination or truly overwhelmed by the bad news of the world. It was a highlight of my year (maybe decade) to interview Brach about her new book. Below, she offers suggestions on the many practices we can try for self-discovery and awareness, and ways to unlock our own deep and true loving nature. Eve Ekman: When you teach meditation and compassion practice, I really appreciate your focus on the body in a variety of different ways. Why is being embodied so important? Tara Brach is the founder of the Insight Meditation Community of Washington, D.C. \u00a9 Jason Elias Tara Brach: When we reflect on what we cherish, it\u2019s intimacy with others, creativity, wisdom, wonder, living fully\u2014and all of them are sourced in an embodied presence. This is why I call the book Radical Compassion : If compassion is just mental, an idea about somebody suffering that\u2019s not grounded in that feeling of tenderness in our hearts, it doesn\u2019t motivate us to actively express our care. Radical compassion is radical because you go to the roots, because it\u2019s embodied. All of us have a kind of degree of dissociation from the body, to avoid that raw intensity that lives in our bodies. Often we hold the emotional wounds we\u2019ve experienced in our bodies, \u201cour issues in our tissues.\u201d It really is a deep part of the spiritual path to, with gentleness and awareness, come into the body and reopen to what we have been avoiding. There is even more disassociation if there\u2019s been trauma versus a safe, kind upbringing where it is safe to be in our bodies. Disassociation is also amplified by being in a speedy high-tech culture. So it\u2019s very pervasive. It does take practice to re-awaken through our body. I encourage people to do mindful body scans, yoga, qigong, or other meditative practices that help us wake up in our bodies. I also feel really strongly that anyone who has experienced trauma needs to be careful to go gradually and with a healer therapist, so that they don\u2019t re-traumatize themselves by trying to be embodied. It takes a real atmosphere of care and safety. I sometimes think of how we imagine shy, scared creatures in the woods\u2014these are like parts of ourselves that are in our body that we are avoiding. We need to invite them into the light of awareness. If there\u2019s something in us that feels difficult to feel, we just say: I\u2019m here. If there\u2019s fear, I sometimes invite people to sense the fear sitting next to them on a park bench, and then gradually let yourself feel how it\u2019s living inside you. Re-associating to our bodies is a gradual path. EE: Looking to the body wisdom is like discovering a different language. In your experience, is it a challenge for people to find their body in the beginning? TB: A lot of them. And the more dissociation, the more challenge because it\u2019s just what you said\u2014there\u2019s different language for that body knowing. It takes a certain kind of sensitivity to listening inwardly to be able to feel our body. And if our body has been a dangerous place, then that sensitivity gets cut off; we actually leave the premises and we don\u2019t want to listen. So it\u2019s almost like learning how to listen carefully and use real gentleness and kindness. It might simply be to put your hand on your throat, gently from the inside out to just sense what wants to be paid attention to in there. Body Scan Meditation Feeling tense? Feel your body relax as you try this practice. Try It Now EE: In your book, there are many powerful visualization practices. But there are very few high-caliber scientific studies of visualization. How do you understand the unique benefits of imagination or visualization as part of meditation practice? TB: Loving presence, for example, is a basic capacity and it can be cultivated and strengthened. In order to strengthen it, we need to find pathways, ways of paying attention that wake up our feeling of warmth and openness, and it really helps to use all our senses. The most common pathway we use is offering a loving message, such as \u201cI love you, I am here with you,\u201d that we say to ourselves. We can do that mentally, or we can do it with a soft whisper. That\u2019s one modality. Another modality that\u2019s really, really powerful is touch. In the moments that we put our hand on our heart, there\u2019s a warmth and a connection that actually helps us to become more tender. Then, back to your question, there is yet another modality, and it is imagery and visualization. Many different spiritual and psychological traditions use imagery and visualization, such as in the meditations from Tibetan Buddhism, among others. We take in so much information through our eyes and we think visually. So having something represented in the visual field that actually relates to a deep inner experience\u2014it\u2019s like the seed is already there, but the image helps to nourish it and bring it into its fullness. So whether it\u2019s the image of a person you really love and trust embracing you, or imagining a more formless loving presence with light and warmth, it wakes up that experience. EE: I love your description of using all of our senses\u2014why exclude any of them, right? TB: Some sensory modalities are more well developed than others. If a person who is primarily auditory is trying visualization, they will be groping around. For a person that\u2019s very kinesthetic, having them put their hand on the heart is really helpful. Sometimes it\u2019s best to have a person use a modality they don\u2019t use very much because that opens up other parts of their brain and sensitivity. My instructions to people are to make practices an experiment. Ask yourself the question: What ways of paying attention help me to wake up a feeling of love? And then customize your practice to make it your own. EE: And what we need could change day to day, right? TB: That\u2019s a fabulous point. We know we can get into a habit of doing a loving-kindness practice a certain way, and then it gets rote and it loses some of its freshness and power. So it\u2019s very good to mix it up. EE: There are many useful practices in your book. The one that really stuck out to me was the \u201cif only\u201d reflection. Can you talk about it a bit? Radical Compassion: Learning to Love Yourself and Your World with the Practice of RAIN (Viking, 2019, 288 pages) TB: There\u2019s a phrase, \u201cif only\u201d mind. Without actually saying it to ourselves, it directs our way of moving through the day: \u201cIf only this would happen, if only I lost the 10 pounds, if only I could get a promotion, if only so and so would treat me differently.\u201d We don\u2019t realize how many moments of our life, on some level, are being driven by this sense that we want life different; we\u2019re hoping the next moment will provide what this moment does not. It happens both on the larger landscape of our life \u2014\u201cIf only I could have the right partner\u201d\u2014and also happens during the day, \u201cIf only I could get a cup of coffee, or get finished with all my emails,\u201d and so on. This is so powerful because it\u2019s a trance, we\u2019re leaning in the future, we\u2019re on our way somewhere else. A big realization we can explore in this practice is that when we\u2019re suffering, it\u2019s because in some way we feel like something\u2019s wrong or missing in the present moment; we\u2019re at odds with reality. Thus recognizing \u201cif only\u201d mind helps us come into relationship with the present moment. In Radical Compassion , I offer a lot of reflections to bring unconscious habits that keep us in trance into the light of awareness. If we bring \u201cif only\u201d mind into awareness, we have the chance to open our hearts more fully to the life that\u2019s right here. EE: You are not a monastic living away from the world; you are very much in the world. How do you keep up your practice with all the demands of your everyday life? TB: First off, my commitment to practice doesn\u2019t come out of a kind of a rigidity, or a sense of \u201cshould.\u201d I actually love practicing. I love love, and I love truth, and so I\u2019m pretty motivated. My life is very demanding, so I have set for myself some guidelines that work. One of them is that I don\u2019t do technology until after I\u2019ve already walked out in the woods by the river and done my sitting. Similarly in the evening: no screens in the bedroom. So there\u2019s really an unwinding, a chance to sit and stretch and come out of virtual reality. After my morning sit, I set intentions, such as: \u201cLet me be awake and kind through the day.\u201d And I\u2019ll build in a lot of different ways of pausing. EE: Today, many people have never met their contemplative teacher; they only know them by books and podcasts, like me before I met you this morning. What is the role of the teacher in our practice? TB: Teachers can be incredibly wonderful, helpful older friends\u2014friends that are farther on the path, so to speak. And they also can be a shadow side, where we play out all of our dependency and abuse of power. So like everything else, that relationship needs to be approached with a tremendous amount of mindfulness. We need each other. One of the big illusions on the path is that I\u2019m a separate self trying to wake myself up. The only way we can realize our non-separateness is to realize our mutual belonging is it. Here we are, you and I, and as we\u2019re exploring these spiritual questions we sense that behind our roles, the one who\u2019s looking through those eyes is no different than the one that\u2019s looking through these eyes and this heart, and that the tender place in this heart inside this body is the same field of tenderness in that other person. When we can remember that, it\u2019s a far more liberating experience than if I\u2019m on my cushion with my eyes closed, thinking that I\u2019m waking up separately from others. EE: This dovetails with lots of research that practicing a kind, helpful orientation toward others provides us with meaning. How do you make sense of two themes in contemplative practices\u2014finding happiness within and finding happiness through relationship with others? TB: It can seem an opposition when we say that your true refuge is your own awakening heart, breaking the habit of thinking that we need something out there and instead finding peace and wisdom and infinite tenderness right here. I\u2019m always already here, and that\u2019s true. The more we open to that, the more we discover that that place of refuge is really a shared field. We\u2019re really connecting with the larger belonging, it\u2019s not \u201cmyself\u201d that is OK. It actually relaxes into sensing \u201cwe the collective.\u201d When we go inward and become profoundly present to the love that\u2019s right here, we can also sense our relatedness and sense our mutual belonging. Either way, we\u2019re still discovering what\u2019s beyond the separate self. The more we learn to relate to our inner life with compassion and embodied presence, the more that compassion and embodied presence naturally includes everyone else. They go both ways. It\u2019s all about just relationship\u2014relating to life right here, relating to this life between others.

In this article, Tara Brach explains how to use RAIN as a guide to less distant, less controlled, more open and compassionate relationships. Dive deep into this teaching by listening to the guided reflections throughout the article. Tara Brach Tara Brach, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist, an internationally known teacher of mindfulness meditation, and bestselling author. Mental Health and Wellbeing Tara Brach Tara Brach, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist, an internationally known teacher of mindfulness meditation, and bestselling author. Mental Health and Wellbeing This is a transcription of a talk Tara Brach has given on December 11th, 2019, in Bethesda, MD. This is the second of a three-part article series. In \u201cRadical Compassion (Part 1)\u201d, Tara shares her understanding of the trance of unworthiness, the importance of nurturing and how to practice RAIN to flourish self-compassion. In this second part, she explores how to use RAIN meditation for better relationships and awaken our heart to give compassion not just to one person, but all-inclusively. If you rather listen to the talk, just play the audio below: Radical Compassion \u2013 Loving Ourselves & Our World Into Healing (Part 2 Of 3) Tara Brach 53:08 The third article of this series explores the three blockages of the sense of belonging and their antidotes. RAIN Meditation As A Guide To Waking Up With Each Other I was sent by a friend an article about a palliative caregiver who works with children who are dying in South Africa. He did a survey with them, a kind of informal one, and the inquiry was \u201cWhat makes life worth living?\u201d One of the main responses was, \u201cNobody wishes that they\u2019d spent more time online.\u201d That was the first thing. The other one I want to name was, \u201cKindness matters.\u201d If you see this article, it\u2019s quite beautiful just registering that when we\u2019re really aware that we don\u2019t have that much time, we don\u2019t want to be off in some virtual reality and we do want to be in our hearts. I wanted to start that way because this is the second of a three-part series on radical compassion. It\u2019s based on the title of my new book. The book and these articles are meant to give some guidance in using the RAIN meditation\u2014which is mindfulness and compassion in working with our inner life, whatever stuck places we have going on. In this article, it\u2019ll be relational\u2014how do we wake up more with each other? How Do We Want To Live? We begin with a holiday story that is really one of my favorite illustrations. In this story, an old man in Phoenix calls his son in New York and says, \u201cI hate to ruin your day but your mother and I are divorcing. Thirty years of misery are enough. I can\u2019t handle it anymore.\u201d The son screams at him, \u201cWhat are you talking about, pop!\u201d And he says, \u201cWe can\u2019t stand the sight of each other any longer. We are sick and tired of each other. So go call your sister in Chicago and tell her.\u201d And he, click, hangs up. Okay, so son calls his sister. And she immediately, as soon as she hears it, she says, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Then she calls her father in Phoenix. She says, \u201cYou are not getting divorced. Don\u2019t do a single thing until I get there. I\u2019m calling my brother back. We\u2019ll both be there tomorrow.\u201d She hangs up. The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife, \u201cOkay. They\u2019re coming for the holidays and they\u2019re paying their own way!\u201d I start with this because so much is flying around for so many people around the holidays. The light of awareness shines on where the different tensions are, they may not be as extremely manipulative as that but we get the idea. In a little bit I\u2019ll have you do a reflection on just looking at your current relationships in some way with that lens of, you know, \u201chow is this for me?\u201d And one of the lenses we\u2019ll use is \u201cIf I was at the end of my life looking back\u2026\u201d I find it very powerful to use our life span as a lens. I often quote another palliative caregiver who, after sitting with thousands of people, reported that the greatest regret of the dying was, \u201cI didn\u2019t live true to myself. I lived according to others\u2019 expectations, maybe according to my own internalized judgment, but I didn\u2019t live aligned with my heart.\u201d What does that mean \u201caligned with our heart\u201d? It really means: if we\u2019re at the end of our life looking back, how would we want this relationship to be, how do we want to be, what kind of presence and connection would we want here? Are we really embodying what matters to us? And to me what\u2019s valuable is that this isn\u2019t just the dying that have regrets about their life. You know, I talk to a lot of people and I can sense right under the surface there\u2019s a disappointment that this life isn\u2019t really unfolding the way they want it to be. I\u2019m not the way I want myself to be, it\u2019s not just the dying that sense of being unaligned. So, how do we want to live? What I find when I really explore with people is the language of radical compassion. And what I mean by radical compassion is that we\u2019re embodied; in other words we can\u2019t really be compassionate if it\u2019s this idea in our mind, like we hear about people out there that are having a hard time and we go \u201cOh that\u2019s really too bad, I feel\u2026 I am so sorry\u201d\u2014versus the kind of compassion when our hearts are tender and they\u2019re resonant and we\u2019re actually caring and we act or we want to act. What Is Radical Compassion In A Relational Sense? Radical compassion means we\u2019re embodied and the caring is active. And radical compassion means that our hearts are all-inclusive, it\u2019s not like we feel a whole lot of compassion for this person but this person doesn\u2019t deserve my care\u2013it\u2019s not like that; it\u2019s a very open, inclusive quality of heart. I\u2019m spending a little time on the definition because I think we need to reclaim the word \u201ccompassion.\u201d It\u2019s floating out there, it\u2019s like \u201clove,\u201d it\u2019s very mushy. And yet, if there\u2019s ever a time in the world\u2019s history that we need to actively cultivate compassion and caring and stretch ourselves, widen the circles beyond where habitually we pay attention, it\u2019s now. It\u2019ll be what allows us to care enough, to care for our earth that is suffering so much, for those that are most vulnerable, and live true to ourselves right in an immediate way tonight and tomorrow with the people that we are interacting with. So we need to reclaim it. And in that spirit let\u2019s reflect for a moment: Radical Compassion (Part 2): Reflection 1 Tara Brach 4:03 The Limbic Controller We\u2019ll be returning to explore how you can wake up more the heart with these people that you might have brought to mind. But what we find for most of us\u2014and it\u2019s really important to explore this and reflect without judging because if you add judgment to it you\u2019re actually further blocking compassion and love for other people\u2014but what we do find is that what gets in the way is some version of what I\u2019m going to call our limbic controller. There\u2019s some part of us that\u2019s emotionally reactive and trying to control things. And we have different ways of trying to control things. One of the ways is we try to manage other people and get them to be a certain way. And that always gets in the way: if we want somebody to be different, if we\u2019re managing them, if we\u2019re trying to get them to be a certain way with us, in those moments we are not letting them be who they are. In one story a young man invited his mother over for dinner. And during the meal his mother kept noticing how her son\u2019s roommate was really beautiful and she was suspicious that her son had a relationship going with this roommate. And so she was really curious and she watched them interact over the evening and became even more convinced something was going on. And her son read her mind and said, \u201cHey, I just want to reassure you that Kerry and I are just roommates. You know that\u2019s how it is.\u201d So, a week later Kerry comes to John, the son, and says, \u201cYou know, ever since your mother was here for dinner I haven\u2019t been able to find that beautiful silver soup ladle. Do you think she did something with it?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know but I\u2019ll email her.\u201d So he writes this, he says, \u201cDear mother, I\u2019m not saying you did or did not do anything with the soup ladle but it\u2019s odd that it disappeared after dinner. Do you know anything about this?\u201d Later he receives an email from his mother and it reads, \u201cDear son, I\u2019m not saying you do sleep with Kerry and I\u2019m not saying that you don\u2019t. But the fact remains that if she were sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the soup ladle by now. Love, your mother.\u201d This is what I mean by the limbic controller, just an example. Every one of us has patterns in our relationships based on our survival brain that actually create distance. I\u2019m going to name some and I invite you to, again, just read and sense what resonates for you. If you become aware of them, you then have choice as to whether or not you\u2019re living them out, but if you\u2019re not aware of them you\u2019re identified with them. You are the controller and you don\u2019t have a choice. And this goes very much to what Victor Frankl described when he said, \u201cBetween the stimulus and the response there is a space. And in that space is our power and our freedom.\u201d That you\u2019ll keep repeating the same relational patterns that block intimacy until you see that particular version of the controller. There Are Different Types Of The Limbic Controller One of them is that\u2014and this is a bit of a kind of a freeze-response\u2014we bury and don\u2019t show what\u2019s going on and we pretend . We offer what we think is going to be most acceptable to others, this is the person somebody else will like and approve. It can be the ways we accommodate or whatever, but we\u2019re burying the real feelings we have either about this person or about our life and pretending in some way. And this is very much seen in a classic story of a woman who approaches her psychology professor and asks him, you know, \u201cWhat is a Freudian Slip? What do they mean by it?\u201d And he\u2019s curious and he says, \u201cWell, what makes you ask?\u201d And she says, \u201cWell, the other day I was having lunch with my mother and I meant to ask her to pass the salt but instead I said, \u2018You damn bitch, you ruined my life\u2019.\u201d Now, on purpose I\u2019m giving you kind of wacky examples. We all do this stuff. We don\u2019t say what we mean and then it comes out sideways. So it\u2019s just an example. Another example for the limbic controller is grasping where we have our expectations, our demands, we in some way feel special or important and we very quickly go into feeling victimized, disappointed, let down, we are the one that the other is not treating right. And that\u2019s sometimes called the pursuer \u2014 I want you, I want you to be here, I want you to be a certain way, I want you to spend more time with me. Of course, pursuers always need avoiders ; we also have some of us whose limbic type is more the avoidance, it\u2019s like \u201cI need space,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t suffocate me,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t cross my boundaries,\u201d being unavailable, being guarded, being mistrusting, withholding, disinterested, defended. A woman is in a job interview. And the interviewer asks, \u201cTell me what do you think your biggest character defect would be?\u201d And her reply is, \u201cHonesty.\u201d And the interviewer said, \u201cHonesty? I wouldn\u2019t consider that a defect.\u201d And her reply is, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the hell you think!\u201d It\u2019s that. It\u2019s like \u201cStay away,\u201d okay? And then another major version of the limbic controller is aggression in the sense of blame and that\u2019s where the ongoing notion is \u201cYou should be different\u201d, \u201cYou are not the way you should be.\u201d And most of us have that as part of us, we have a judgment going on, how another should be different. And when we do, it creates a huge distance. Ram Dass wrote this \u201cOne of the greatest things that happened in my relationship with my father was when he was approaching death. I finally allowed him to be who he was instead of trying to make him into who I thought he should be. And he stopped trying to make me into who he thought I should be. And we became friends.\u201d It\u2019s sad to say that we might have to get towards the death to start getting the wisdom that knows that if we\u2019re interacting with someone and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on that \u201cYou should be different\u201d creates that distance. Who Is Looking Out Of The Spacesuit? So, you might have been listening and went, \u201cWow! Check. Check. Check.\u201d We all have some ways of trying to control in relationships. I often describe it as we get born into a challenging world and to navigate we put on a spacesuit, that in some way protects and defends us and has ways of navigating to try to survive. The challenge is that we get identified with our strategies. We become the blamer or we become the pursuer or we become the avoider. We forget who\u2019s really looking through the mask of the spacesuit, we forget who\u2019s here and we forget who the other is, they appear as an ego spacesuit, too. How RAIN Helps To Wake Up From This Identification The inquiry here is: How do we wake up from that identification and loosen the grip on our habitual strategies? How do we do that? It takes real courage. Each of them can be deconditioned. We\u2019re going to explore RAIN as kind of the solvent because RAIN is really mindfulness and compassion which helps us not to get rid off the strategy\u2014I mean, you might still find blaming goes on or you might still find yourself always wanting to create some space\u2014but you won\u2019t be as identified. There\u2019s more flexibility, there\u2019s more creativity. The first step, though, is what we are doing now; which is slowing down and beginning to pay attention to notice the strategies. I\u2019d like to invite you to reflect again if you will. This guided reflection explores the first steps of RAIN practice, Recognizing and Allowing. Radical Compassion (Part 2): Recognizing and Allowing Tara Brach 3:06 The next step of RAIN is the I, which is Investigate . I want to give you some examples because I\u2019m going to, of course, bring you back at the end to do the whole process. The investigating is often misleading because when you\u2019re investigating what\u2019s going on it\u2019s not a conceptual, mental process. Investigating is primarily getting more somatic. Investigating means that if you\u2019ve found that you felt hurt by somebody or felt blame you get into where you feel it in your body. And then you can investigate and sense, you know, \u201cWhat\u2019s the unmet need?\u201d and so on. Read more: Discovering and nurturing unmet needs is also an important step in practicing how to let go of anger. In this article, Tara Brach uncovers the responsibility of our own experience and how we can alter our anger patterning. I\u2019m going to give you an example because investigating, if you really get into your body, then leads to the N of RAIN, which is Nurturing . Once you have Recognized and Allowed and Investigated and Nurtured, you\u2019ll find that the sense of identity has shifted, you\u2019re no longer organized around the limbic controller so much. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. I\u2019m going to actually share two stories. And the first one is one that taught me the most about the power of RAIN in relationships. And it was really early on, this was when my son, Narayan, was a junior in high school. And some of you might remember this somewhat because I\u2019ve had this in \u201cRadical Acceptance\u201d but I\u2019m going to unpack it a little bit more now. The setup here is that he\u2019s a junior, he\u2019s entirely unmotivated around academics, he\u2019s a total party creature, smoking a lot of pod, playing video games, and he\u2019s completely immersed in \u201cMagic: The Gathering,\u201d Some of you might be familiar\u2026 My response to all of that: I am perpetually judging him, the limbic controller was the, you know, aggressive, \u201cYou should be different,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like this change\u201d kind of\u2026 that was where I was, completely in that. I was really upset with him for not coming through as the disciplined son that I thought he should be. And I had a kind of one of those moments I\u2019ll never forget of being outside his bedroom hearing the sounds of one of the games that I couldn\u2019t stand because they were all totally violent video games and having this desire to take a huge boulder and go in there and just smash his computer screen with it and then realizing in a flash: He is a junior, he\u2019s going to be gone in a couple of years and then feeling my heart go: \u201cwow, am I going to be in this chronic stand off the angry, let down mother and the son who\u2019s kind of wanting to not have me too near him because I\u2019m angry at him a lot.\u201d That\u2019s when I started to do a lot more, \u201cOkay, let me be with what\u2019s inside me.\u201d The first step in bringing RAIN to relationships is to bring it to your own reaction, to whatever your own limbic controller is doing, that\u2019s the first step. So, I brought it inside, I Recognized and Allowed that I was angry and judging, and then I started Investigating, which is where we left off. The layers where I felt the squeeze in my heart\u2014and it was fear\u2014and the fear place was afraid that his whole future would be sabotaged and so on. And then underneath that I felt that hollow, achy place of shame, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I was too lenient, too permissive, didn\u2019t set boundaries early enough\u201d\u2014which may have been true\u2014but\u2026 He and I talk about that now that he is a parent. Then I was feeling that shame of falling short, deficiency, that achy, hollow place. And then it went into grief, this sense of just this crashing feeling of the grief of the distance that was, you know, developing between us. And I had this experience I sometimes call like a \u201csoul sadness\u201d, which is seeing the landscape of life and realizing how sorrowful it is to be caught in a pattern like this and distanced. That\u2019s what lead to Nurture. I had investigated in my body the layers and then, after feeling that soul sadness, I sensed\u2014I always ask the question and I invite you to use this as part of your investigating\u2014\u201dWhat does this hurting part inside me need?\u201d And what I needed was to trust the goodness of my own love, that I really loved him, and to trust him, to trust his goodness, that\u2019s really what I needed. So, I just sat there as I often do with my hands on my heart, just feeling how much I do love him and just reminding myself I do love him and he is lovable and he is good and it\u2019s going to be okay, you know, that kind of thing. And as I let that feeling spread through me of loving him and trusting that loving there was an opening and a tenderizing and more space and I was no longer inside the identity of the controlling mother, I was in a more spacious place. It didn\u2019t mean those tendencies were gone, I had to re-do this many, many times, but it started shifting my identification, so that when I started trying to speak with him, I was able to bring in more of my basic appreciation for him, you know, for his sense of his mastery in his games that he played and his loyalty and love for his friends and whatever it was and set boundaries. This is an example of RAIN in relationship because I feel like it gave me back many moments with him before he graduated. I am so glad I didn\u2019t stay stuck in that stand-off. And just to give you a kind of follow up\u2026 Now we are like 18 years later. He\u2019s thirty-two. He\u2019s much more disciplined, he\u2019s graduated from the program he was in, he is working, he\u2019s a father, he\u2019s okay, and he still plays \u201cMagic: The Gathering\u201d so\u2026 he\u2019s okay. This is an example of\u2014and what I want to emphasize it\u2014a shift in identity where the limbic patterns are there but they don\u2019t hijack. It\u2019s possible when you do RAIN that they don\u2019t hijack. Now, sometimes there is the kind of hurt or conflict that requires really deep inner work and it takes time and it takes support. It takes support from others and it takes many, many rounds. I want to share with you a story of a guy I worked with some years ago where it wasn\u2019t like something like with my son who was being a typical teen. This is a man, a photojournalist, who I actually went to college with and heard from after many years of not hearing from him. He, African-American, photojournalist, who married a Caucasian woman. Her mother completely disapproved of the marriage, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re too different! You\u2019re going to ruin each other\u2019s lives\u201d and so on. And when they\u2019d visit, his mother would ignore him or else be rude. And it was awful. So, he was increasingly feeling withdrawn, angry and hurt. It brought up this very old wound in him of \u201cI\u2019m invisible, I\u2019m not okay, I\u2019m not worthy,\u201d you know, he was \u201cthe black man who was not good enough for her daughter\u201d was what he described to me. And his wife said, \u201cWe don\u2019t ever have to visit them again. I don\u2019t want to put you through this.\u201d But he actually wasn\u2019t willing to give up on the relationship partly because one of his teacher\u2019s\u2014a Tibetan teacher\u2014key teachings was, \u201cNever give up on anyone\u201d which I thought was interesting. So, he made it his practice. And it was a hard practice. At home he would recognize and allow how angry and hurt he felt, then he\u2019d investigate and feel in his body and felt where it went back to because in childhood he was neglected, a lot of losses, a lot of feeling of being not okay. So he felt this twist in his body when he\u2019d go into it of \u201cdefective personhood,\u201d that\u2019s what he got in touch with in his body, his gut. And then when he asked what he needed, it was, \u201cYou\u2019re of value. You\u2019re worthy.\u201d His way of doing it was he would imagine some light kind of coming into him and he\u2019d just hear the words \u201cYou are valuable. You\u2019re a worthy being.\u201d Over and over and over again until he found that sense of more space, more openness, more realizing he was not the self in the story that this mother was triggering or his old story, he felt his value, what I call \u201cthe gold.\u201d The next holiday he went but he brought his camera because he needed a way to be more safe and the camera gave him a place to be one step removed but still there. And so it was Thanksgiving and he took all sorts of photos. And when they went again over the Christmas holidays, there was a gift exchange. And, by the way, each of these visits the mother was rude and distancing and didn\u2019t want to take them to a restaurant because she was afraid she\u2019d see her friends. It was terrible. So, there they\u2019re having their exchange. And this is what I want to tell you about, the gift exchange. The mother gives him socks which are the wrong size and a box of candy \u2013 and he is a health nut so that didn\u2019t work so well. He gave her some framed pictures that he had taken during Thanksgiving. And one of them had captured a moment of affection with her husband and the other when she was cradling her new granddaughter. She opens these pictures \u2013 I mean, everybody is kind of watching her \u2013 and she starts sobbing because he had seen her in a good way, he had seen her goodness and captured it. And something in that just phew . He told me that as he was doing RAIN for himself\u2013that inner process\u2013that he started looking at her and he could just see her as a fearful person but when he could really get that, he didn\u2019t feel so angry at her. And now, he saw her in a good way. Here is what happened. A thaw began but it didn\u2019t happen quickly, there were many rounds of him encountering her tightness and so on, but he had a way of taking care of himself and he had a way to see past her mask and that actually, over time, helped her to see past what she was seeing in him. I\u2019m sharing this story because as much as our unmet needs are personal, there is also a whole societal thing playing when we run into distance. That we often don\u2019t compute, the unseen biases that are playing between us, the ways that different ones of us have felt devalued\u2013historically not just in our personal life but through the society\u2013so it takes a lot of attention to be able to bring RAIN inwardly and then look through eyes that can start seeing those realities both on an individual and on a societal level. Looking Behind The Mask, Every Day What we\u2019re exploring tonight are relationships that inevitably are torqued because of unmet needs. And I\u2019m inviting you to pause and find that space where you can have more freedom and choice by seeing how your strategies are contributing to distancing. The key piece here is that we need to do this in an incredibly non-judging way because every one of us plays out these strategies. We also need to do it in a way where we\u2019re practicing seeing the goodness behind the mask because our habit is not to see that. I\u2019ll share a story I heard some years ago. A physician described an elderly patient who came in each week but one week they had to switch the time and it was earlier in the day. And he was very edgy, he wanted to leave the appointment as quickly as he could, and she asked how come. And he said well, he had to go and visit his wife who was in a nursing home and he wanted to be there on time to eat breakfast with her. And so the physician said, you know, asked him some more questions and inquired about his wife\u2019s health. And this man told the physician, \u201cWell, she has had Alzheimer\u2019s for a number of years.\u201d And then the physician said, \u201cWell, will she be upset if you\u2019re a bit late?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t any longer know who he is.\u201d And then the physician was surprised, \u201cAnd you still go every morning and she doesn\u2019t know who you are?\u201d This is what she wrote, \u201cHe smiled as he patted my hand and said, \u2018She doesn\u2019t know me. But I still know who she is.\u2019\u201d These practices of radical compassion are not something we do once in a while. It\u2019s a daily way with the people we are with, with whoever you\u2019re identifying, to say, \u201cAm I able to see past the mask? Can I see the goodness that\u2019s there? How am I in this moment creating distance?\u201d\u2013that kind of honesty\u2013and then to be very, very kind towards what we see. It\u2019s not our fault. Putting Out Blankets Instead Of Armoury Scott McClanahan says, \u201cOne time a man left home. He had argued with his mother and father the day before he left. They spoke horrible words to one another and he left without saying goodbye. He had been gone many years and even spent time in jail. Years later, he finally got out of jail and he wondered if his mother and father were even alive and if they were ashamed of what had been said and where he had wound up. He wrote them and told them he\u2019d be coming home on a specific day the following week. If they wanted to see him and were not ashamed, they should put a blanket on a clothesline and he would know to come inside. If the blanket was missing, then he would know that he was not welcome, he would know how to turn back. He told them he hoped they were in good health. The man arrived by rail the next week. He was nervous when he stepped off the train. There was no one there to meet him. He walked up the worn path towards the home place and thought about the past, he thought about the time in jail, he thought about how ashamed his parents must have been, thought about the horrible words they spoke. He was just about to turn around when he saw a blanket in a tree. He kept walking and he saw another blanket. He kept walking and he saw another blanket. Then he turned towards home and the house was covered in blankets, the yard was covered in blankets, the clothes line was covered in blankets, the path to the door was covered in blankets, his parents were standing there and they were welcoming him inside.\u201d So, each of us has ways to create walls to protect our heart when we are hurt. And the path of radical compassion is to begin to shed or dissolve some of that armoring. Rumi writes, \u201cVery little grows on jagged rock. Be ground, be crumbled, so wild flowers will come up where you are. You\u2019ve been stony too many years. Try something different. Surrender.\u201d We\u2019re going to close with a meditation that\u2019s a \u201cBlanket\u2019s RAIN meditation\u201d because really, think about it, what if we all were putting out blankets in our lives, you know, just in some way blankets for ourselves, forgiving ourselves for our strategies and our ways of navigating that are imperfect and certainly blankets for others because others, too, are doing the best they can and it\u2019s imperfect.

Posted January 10, 2020 | Reviewed by Hara Estroff Marano Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email One of the great blocks to realizing the gold of who we are is our conviction that something is wrong with me . When I teach about the trance of unworthiness, I\u2019m often asked: \u201cWhy do we hold on so tightly to our belief in our own deficiency. Why are we so loyal to our suffering, so addicted to our self-judgment?\u201d Our beliefs live not only in our mind but in a constellation of feelings and emotions embedded in our bodies. They are deeply familiar. They feel like \u201cme.\u201d Most are rooted in interpretations of reality we formed in early childhood , and we rely on them for guidance and protection. They tell us who we are and what we can expect from ourselves, from others, and from the world. Source: Pexels Our most potent negative self-beliefs arise from early experiences of fear and wounding. Our survival-driven negativity bias inclines us to remember painful events much more readily than pleasant ones. The fixation on what might be threatening is compounded by another tendency, the confirmation bias , which leads us to focus on information that matches or reinforces our existing beliefs\u2014particularly in the case of charged issues like our value as a person. The upshot: We make an airtight case for our belief in personal deficiency. In my work with meditation students and clients over the last decades, I\u2019ve seen how the belief that we are unlovable or unworthy has stopped people from having intimate relationships, generated ongoing anxiety and depression , fueled addictive behavior, and caused harm to loved ones. Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche writes: The snake that cannot shed its skin, perishes. To flourish, we need to release the belief that something is wrong with us. Real But Not True Janice, a single mom, was a friend who had started coming to my weekly meditation class. In addition to having a demanding job, she felt caught between the needs of Bruce, her 15-year-old son, who was struggling with social anxiety , and the needs of her dad, who lived for her visits at his assisted-living facility. He always lit up when she arrived, and then when she got up to leave, he\u2019d anxiously ask when she was coming back. She resented him for making her feel guilty, resented the time away from work and her son, and, most deeply, resented herself for not being more open-hearted and gracious. Janice had begun to practice RAIN but, so far, the tangle of resentment hadn\u2019t budged. Then, during one of our walks, she asked for my help. So I put on my meditation-teacher hat and asked her what she was believing about herself. She responded immediately, \u201cI\u2019m falling short on the most important fronts.\u201d Then shaking her head with resignation, she went on. \u201cYou know, Tara, I\u2019m failing them and\u2026this is awful to say\u2026but I\u2019m just not a loving person.\u201d I then asked Janice something she didn\u2019t expect, a question author Byron Katie uses in her work: \u201cIs it true? Is it true that you\u2019re failing, and that you\u2019re not a loving person?\u201d She responded impatiently, \u201cAll the evidence points that way.\u201d I asked again, \u201cAre you certain that you\u2019re failing, that you\u2019re not a loving enough person. Is it really true?\u201d This time she slowed down before replying. \u201cOK, it really feels true, Tara. I\u2019m not liking myself very much these days . . . but no . . . I guess I\u2019m not certain.\u201d We walked in silence for a bit, and when I glanced at her, Janice looked thoughtful and sad, but not so grim. Then I shared a phrase I\u2019d learned from Tsoknyi Rinpoche, one of my teachers: Real but not true . Yes, our beliefs are real because we experience them mentally, emotionally and physically. And they have a real impact on our lives. As Gandhi put it, they lead to action, create our character, and shape our destiny. But these beliefs\u2014even the ones that feel most true\u2014are only mental representations or symbols of our experience. We need to deepen our presence and ask ourselves: Do our beliefs match the actual, living, changing stuff of our experience in the world? In other words, are they true? One of the most life-changing realizations you can have is: I don\u2019t have to believe my thoughts\u2026they are just thoughts! Any story you have about yourself is not the same as the unfolding reality of what you are: the ongoing life of your senses, the tenderness of your heart, the consciousness that right now is seeing or hearing these words. Yet because our beliefs are continuously filtering and interpreting reality, we mistake our stories about ourselves and the world to be reality itself. Spirituality Essential Reads Religious Influencers Online: Why They Attract Young People 4 Life Lessons From Quaker Spirituality In the weeks to come, reflecting on these teachings about beliefs created a tiny, but important, opening for Janice. She became more hopeful, more willing to deepen her attention . I\u2019ve seen this over and over. When we have enough perspective to realize \"I\u2019m not my thoughts\" or \"This is just a belief\", we are unhooking from the inner dialogue. This enables us to wake up to a larger awareness. Releasing Limiting Beliefs with RAIN The RAIN meditation (Recognize-Allow-Investigate-Nurture) is a crucial help at this point; it offers us a systematic way to loosen the grip of fear-based beliefs. I reviewed the steps of RAIN with Janice and after practicing for several weeks, she shared an experience with me: One afternoon, after she\u2019d parked her car at her father\u2019s nursing home, she decided to do RAIN before going inside to visit. She reclined her seat, closed her eyes and as she brought her father to mind, she felt dutiful, resentful, guilty, tight. Janice was making the U-turn , turning her attention inward, and this was her starting place: She Recognized (R) that cluster of feelings and instead of judging herself for them, simply Allowed (A) herself to feel how painful they were without pushing them away. Then, after a few breaths, she leaned in, beginning to Investigate (I) with interest, trying to get a better sense of what was going on. She gently asked herself \u201cWhat is the worst part about this?\u201d and her attention went right to her chest. She felt heat, tightness, and pressure. \u201cAh,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cI\u2019m angry.\u201d As she let the anger be there, it began to change shape. It morphed into a sense of powerlessness. There was no way she could live up to what was expected of her\u2014with her father, with her son, at work. She was falling short, she would always fail. And now, along with that feeling of helplessness came self-condemnation: \u201cI just don\u2019t like who I am. I don\u2019t like this grim, angry, close-hearted, helpless self.\u201d Investigating had connected her with what she had been running away from: the deep belief that she was failing and was an unloving person. She then recalled the question we had explored together: Is it possible these beliefs are real but not true? Asking this gave her enough space to stay present with what was unfolding. She then asked: When I\u2019m believing this, what is my experience inside? Her heart felt raw, tightly bound, and filled with a very young sense of helplessness and shame . As she contacted this deep emotional pain in her body, she realized that these feelings had been buried within her for as long as she could remember. A natural response of sorrow and self-compassion arose. Janice had reached the N of RAIN, Nurture, and, with tears and with tenderness, she began to whisper to herself, just as she would to a young child, \u201cThis is really difficult, and you\u2019re doing your best. You love Dad, you love Bruce. Now that you\u2019re here, you can relax. It\u2019s enough just to be with Dad now, love him now. It\u2019s okay.\u201d She did relax, as if letting go into the arms of a wise , kind parent. She sat still for another five minutes or so, letting in and resting in the warmth and openness of this new space before she went inside. And when she peeked into her father\u2019s room, he was just waking from a nap. He beamed at her and said, \u201cI just had a dream about you as a little girl trying to ride Rosie.\u201d They laughed and began to share memories of Rosie, a much-loved dog, which led to more memories of good times. As she was leaving, Janice promised that for her next visit, she\u2019d bring some childhood pictures she had digitalized. And when she got to her car, she realized that her father hadn\u2019t asked when she was coming back. She was back, and he wasn\u2019t so lonely . RAIN had enabled Janice to reconnect with a very natural, open-hearted sense of herself, but this didn\u2019t mean that her resentments, guilt , and negative beliefs magically disappeared. RAIN is rarely a one-shot experience; well-grooved beliefs and feelings continue to arise. The difference was, after weeks of practicing RAIN, Janice could see clearly that her beliefs weren\u2019t reality\u2014they didn\u2019t have to confine her life experience and her sense of her own being. Before Janice drifted off to sleep on the night of that visit, she reflected on how long she\u2019d been hounded by a sense of her own deficiency. Then she practiced with one of the inquiries we\u2019d discussed that can deepen the experience of After the RAIN: Who would I be if I didn\u2019t believe this about myself? The response was a spontaneous feeling of spaciousness, buoyancy, and warmth. Her spirit, she realized, was beyond any thought or belief. Trusting this gave Janice a true taste of peace.

      "content_text": "Tara Brach Ph.D. Finding True Refuge Anxiety Radical Self-Compassion Loving ourselves into healing with the practice of RAIN. Posted January 4, 2020 | Reviewed by Davia Sills Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email THE BASICS What Is Anxiety? Take our Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test Find a therapist to overcome anxiety Many years ago, I read a moving article by a hospice caregiver who had accompanied thousands of people during their final weeks. One phrase, in particular, has stayed with me. After countless hours listening to the thoughts of the dying, the caregiver summed up their greatest regret with these words: I wish I\u2019d had the courage to live a life true to myself. Source: Pixabay I started asking myself questions like these: What does it mean to live true to yourself? Do you feel that your life is aligned with what matters to your heart? Are you living true to yourself\u2014today? Right now? A few months later, I began asking the same questions of my meditation students. What I found is that this regret of the dying is also true for many of the rest of us. My students tell me that being true to themselves means being loving, present, and authentic. They speak of being honest, serving others, serving the world. They talk about expressing their creativity , believing in their own worthiness, and working at what they love. And about having the strength to grow beyond their insecurities and to reconcile troubled relationships. They also say that, almost daily, they lose sight of these aspirations and intentions. Instead, they get caught up in reactivity\u2014self-\u00adjudgment, blaming others, pettiness, selfishness, living on autopilot. As one student said, \u201cEach day there\u2019s a big gap between what\u2019s possible and how I\u2019m actually living my life. And with that comes an ever-\u00adlurking sense of personal failure. \u201c The Path of Self-Compassion I know the suffering of that \u201cgap\u201d intimately. Even though I\u2019ve now been teaching and writing about self-compassion for almost 40 years, I still can turn on myself at times of stress. For many years the \u201ctrance of unworthiness\u201d kept me feeling deficient as a friend and daughter, partner and parent. It fueled doubt about my capability as a therapist and teacher. And when I faced severe physical illness, it initially fostered a sense of personal failure. Yet this very suffering\u2014feeling deficient and disconnected\u2014has also been my most fertile ground for waking up. It has led me to a spiritual path and practices that I cherish. And when I get stuck in painful emotions, it brings me to a repeating realization, an insight that has profoundly changed my life: I have to love myself into healing . The only path that can carry me home is the path of self-compassion. RAIN: Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture There\u2019s an image I love that shows mindfulness and compassion as inseparable dimensions of awakening. It depicts awareness as a bird with two wings: When both wings are unfurled in their fullness and beauty, the bird can fly and be free. Finding a way to practice radical compassion brings alive the wings of mindfulness and compassion when we most need them. Practice helps heal and release the painful beliefs and emotions that keep us from living true to ourselves. And for so many of my students and me, that way in is called RAIN. The name is an acronym that stands for the four steps of Recognize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture . Working with these four steps has given me\u2014and can give you\u2014a reliable way to find healing and freedom right where you are in the midst of emotional pain. THE BASICS What Is Anxiety? Take our Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test Find a therapist to overcome anxiety As you\u2019ll see, these steps are easy to learn, and they can be a lifeline in moments when you feel stressed , fearful, reactive, and confused. These same steps, revisited, again and again, build internal resilience and trust in your own wise , awakening heart. They will help you respond to life in a way that expresses the truth and depth and spirit of who you are. Not Enough Time One of the places I most often get caught is in the trance of \u201cnot enough time.\u201d I know I\u2019m not alone; many of us speed through the day, anxiously crossing tasks off the list. This often comes hand in hand with feeling beleaguered, annoyed at interruptions, and worried about what\u2019s around the corner. Anxiety Essential Reads Your Distractions Can Reveal Hidden Strengths What Children's Hair May Reveal About Their Mental Health One day several years ago, I was in last-minute mode and madly sifting through my disorganized files, trying to find material for my evening talk on loving-kindness. Much like the files, my mind was cluttered and chaotic. As I was searching, my 83-year-old mother popped into my office and began telling me about an article she\u2019d seen in The New Yorker . She often stopped by for a casual chat. But seeing that I was busy and distracted, she simply laid the magazine down on my desk and left. As she retreated, something in me just stopped, and I was struck by the reality that she wouldn\u2019t always be around for these shared moments. And then I was struck again: Here I was, ignoring my mom and mentally scurrying around to compose a talk on love! It wasn\u2019t the first time I was jarred by forgetting what mattered. During that first year my mom lived with my husband and me, I felt squeezed by the additional demands on my time. Often when we had dinner together, I\u2019d look for the break in the conversation when I could excuse myself and get back to work. On errands or trips to doctor appointments, rather than enjoying her company, I\u2019d be fixated on how quickly we could get everything done. Our time together often felt obligatory: She was lonely , and I was the main person around. Many times, I felt guilty. And then when I\u2019d slow down some, I also felt a deep sadness. A Pause for Practice That afternoon in my office, I decided to pause and call on RAIN to help me deal with my anxiety about being prepared. I sat down in a comfortable chair and took a few moments to gather myself before beginning. The first step was simply to Recognize (R) what was going on inside me\u2014the swirling anxious thoughts and guilty feelings. The second step was to Allow (A) what was happening by breathing and letting be. I didn\u2019t like what I was feeling, but my intention was not to fix or change anything and not to judge myself for feeling anxious or guilty. Allowing made it possible to collect and deepen my attention before beginning the third step: to Investigate (I) what felt most difficult. With curiosity and care, I directed my attention to the feelings of anxiety in my body\u2014a tightness, pulling, and pressure around my heart. I asked the anxious part of me what it believed, and the answer was deeply familiar: It believed I was going to fail. If I wasn\u2019t perfectly prepared, I\u2019d do a bad job and let people down. But that same anxiety made me unavailable to my mother, so I was also failing someone I loved dearly. As I became conscious of these pulls of guilt and fear , I continued to investigate. Contacting that torn, anxious part of myself, I asked, \u201cWhat do you most need right now?\u201d I could immediately sense that it needed care and reassurance that I was not going to fail in any real way. It needed to trust that the teachings would flow through me and to trust the love that flows between my mother and me. I\u2019d arrived at the fourth step of RAIN, Nurture (N) , and I sent a gentle message inward, directly to that anxious part: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart. You\u2019ll be all right; we\u2019ve been through this so many times before . . . trying to come through on all fronts.\u201d I could feel warm, soothing energy spreading through my body. Then there was a distinct shift: My heart softened a bit, my shoulders relaxed, and my mind felt more clear and open. I sat still for another minute or two and let myself rest in this clearing, rather than quickly jumping back into work. Shifting From Trance to Healing My pause for RAIN took only a few minutes but made a big difference. When I returned to my desk, I was no longer trapped inside the story that something bad was around the corner. Now that the anxiety had loosened, my thoughts began to flow, and I remembered a perfect illustration for my talk. Taking some moments for RAIN gave me access to the clarity and openheartedness that I hoped to talk about that evening. And later that afternoon, my mom and I took a short, sweet walk in the woods, arms linked. Since then, I\u2019ve done a brief version of RAIN with anxiety countless times. I still experience anxiety, but something fundamental has changed. It doesn\u2019t take over. I don\u2019t get lost in a trance. Instead, when I pause and shift my attention from my story about getting things done to the actual experience in my body and heart, it opens up to a space of increased presence and kindness. Often I\u2019ll keep working, but sometimes I decide to step outside and play with my pup, make some tea, or water the plants. There\u2019s more choice. Only by intentionally bringing attention to our inner experience can we move from trance toward healing. But the key is, we have first to realize we\u2019re in a trance\u2014to become aware of the circling anxious thoughts, the tightness in our shoulders, the pressure from rushing about. Then we can begin to turn from our stories\u2014about someone else\u2019s wrongness, about our own deficiencies, about trouble around the corner\u2014to directly feel our fears, hurts, and vulnerability, and ultimately the tender wakefulness of our heart. This is the all-important shift that unfolds progressively through the steps of RAIN.

Mental Health and Wellbeing This is a transcription of\u00a0 the first talk about radical compassion Tara Brach has given on December 4th, 2019, in Bethesda, MD. This is the first of a three-part talk series. In her talk, Tara guides through two meditative practices which are embedded as audio track for the readers\u2019 immersion. You can listen to the full talk below: Radical Compassion - Part 1: Loving Ourselves & Our World Into Healing Tara Brach 55:04 Talk On Radical Compassion By Tara Brach In the second part, Tara explores how to use RAIN meditation for better relationships . The third article of this series explores the three blockages of the sense of belonging and their antidotes. I begin with a story of two women whose boys had gone to high school together. About eight years or so after they graduated they ran into each other and were kind of exchanging stories. One volunteered that her son now was with a very preeminent law firm. The other congratulated her and then said, \u201cWell, my son, he is\u2026 he is still unemployed but he has begun meditating.\u201d The other woman said, \u201cWell, what is meditating?\u201d She goes, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But at least he is not sitting around doing nothing.\u201d In this series, we are going to explore how the path of meditation\u2014and in particular the RAIN practice which is the weave of mindfulness and compassion\u2014can really awaken our heart and spirit. Whether you are new or familiar with the practice of RAIN, this is a way to really deepen the way of working with difficulties and challenges that can really free us up. The primary themes are the grounds of my book \u201cRadical Compassion\u201d . I\u2019ll be referring back to the book and to some of the stories in the book. More than any feedback that I\u2019ve received over the decades about this path and practices, the message I get the most often is that \u201cRAIN has saved my life\u201d which is a pretty intense statement. When I say RAIN, it\u2019s the practices that weave mindfulness and heartfulness because we need them both. That weave really can free us. We\u2019ll explore how we bring the practice to the emotional tangles inside us, how we bring them to tangles in relationships and how they can serve the healing of our world. That message from people was what motivated me to write \u201cRadical Compassion\u201d which is basically a guidebook in using RAIN, it\u2019s really how do you do it. The Story Of The Covered Golden Buddha I\u2019d like to start with a core teaching a lot of the book is based on. In the mid seventeen-hundreds, in Siam\u2014which is now Thailand\u2014they were being invaded by the Burmese. The monks in one monastery had a beautiful, huge pure gold statue of the Buddha and they were fearful it\u2019d be looted by the invading Burmese. So, they did a real tricky thing: they covered it with plaster and clay so it looked like this kind of ordinary, old statue. And as happens, the Burmese did sweep through, every monk was killed, but the statue remained intact. For over two centuries it remained intact. It was so big they couldn\u2019t fit it in a temple, so it was put under a tin roof somewhere. It wasn\u2019t given a great, glorious temple until, a couple of hundred years later, they did build a very large temple. When they were moving the statue a rope broke and the statue fell and some of the covering cracked open and lo and behold they saw the gold and historians realized what had happened. Here is what this story has me reflecting on regularly; I find it so powerful to consider that the gold is our spirit, the gold is that awareness and love that really is living through all of us. It\u2019s quite natural that we all take on protective coverings\u2014I mean, another word for it is \u201cego coverings.\u201d We all have to as a way of navigating a difficult world. The suffering comes because we get identified with those coverings\u2014our strategies to protect and further ourselves\u2014and we forget the gold. That\u2019s the suffering. In Buddhist psychology, it\u2019s basically described as \u201cignorance,\u201d ignoring the truth, the gold, the true nature that\u2019s here. When we forget the gold, our lives get very caught in always trying to further ourselves, our thought patterns all center around the protagonist \u201cMoi\u201d and it\u2019s filled with a lot of anxiety and it\u2019s filled with a lot of loneliness. From \u201cI\u201d To \u201cWe\u201d So, the spiritual path\u2014one way of really understanding it\u2014is discovering the gold, that we\u2019re all learning to start to trust that awareness and heart that\u2019s right here and see it in each other. You can see this expressed in a kind of the most simple way, as a movement from a felt sense of separateness\u2014where all of our thoughts and feelings lead us to feel like we\u2019re kind of in our own enclosed contracted bubble and the world is out there\u2014to a sense of belonging\u2014that we really belong to each other. Hindu yogi Swami Satyananda at one point was asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the nature of true healing?\u201d And he wrote two words on a board, one was \u201cillness\u201d and the other was \u201cwellness\u201d. He circled the I of \u201cillness\u201d and the We of \u201cwellness.\u201d True healing is the movement from the \u201cI\u201d-sense to a sense of this field, that you can actually feel your way into when you start relaxing. This shift from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d is the trajectory of evolution also. Our Conditioning So as it goes, for millions of years, for primates and early humans, there was internally collaboration, there was internally care, there were genes for cooperation within the bands, pro-social behavior, in other words the wiring for empathy and compassion. But then, between bands, there was aggression, all the wiring for fight-flight-freeze, for seeing an other that looked different and immediately having everything in our body register as \u201cdangerous,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d \u201cwatch out,\u201d \u201cflee or fight.\u201d That\u2019s what we inherited. It was only ten-thousand years ago that the collaborating, caring and cooperation started spreading beyond the small group and beyond kin to wider and wider circles. So here we are today. And where does that leave us? What we find out is that we\u2019re witnessing often, when we get disturbed, it\u2019s because we are witnessing the millions of years of conditioning that had us identify the different other as \u201cbad\u201d and be in that fight-flight-freeze. We see it in\u2014I am thinking in the United States in particular\u2014the virulent racism in this country that just shifts forms all the time but has such a grip, that \u201cunreal othering.\u201d Our trajectory is to wake up from separation. And evolutionary psychologists actually see it as a trajectory. There is more peace in general, over time. I mean, if you look back a few hundred years, there was a lot more bias and reactivity and more going on than even now. So that\u2019s our trajectory. And then we\u2019re gonna spend more time in our individual lives: What was today like? How much was today coming from the more primitive conditioning of kind of the grasping \u201cI need this for myself\u201d or the anxiety or the defendedness versus a sense of generosity, of \u201cwe,\u201d or caring. When we bring it to today, it\u2019s absolutely essential\u2014and I\u2019m gonna keep coming back to this\u2014that we bring tremendous amount of forgiving and acceptance because inevitably we\u2019re gonna see\u2026 we each are rigged to have all the stages of evolution play out through us. So each day we\u2019re gonna see how greed or fear arises, defensive, wanting things our own way, insensitive to the needs of others, a shift from any sense of \u201cwe\u201d to \u201cI want my way.\u201d Let\u2019s do a little reflection, okay? Radical Compassion Part 1 - Reflection Practice Tara Brach 4:01 If we compare when we\u2019re caught in our kind of more primitive nervous system versus the more awake, evolved, recently evolved nervous system, the key difference we start to notice is this sense of how we are with our inner life, that we\u2019re not at war, we\u2019re at home with ourselves. Don\u2019t Carry A Gun There\u2019s a wonderful movie, \u201cGorillas In The Mist.\u201d Dian Fossey is this field biologist who stars in it and she follows in the footsteps of George Shaler who is a primate biologist whose renown came because he returned from the wilds with more intimate and compelling information about gorillas than any scientist had ever gathered. Now how did he do that? That\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting about the movie and about her role, too. He didn\u2019t carry a gun when he went into the field. How did he find out more and get intimate with the gorillas? How do we get intimate with ourselves? Not to carry a gun. So previous generations of observers, of field biologists, had entered the territory of these large, wild gorillas with the assumption that they were fearsome or dangerous, the \u201cbad other,\u201d you know, and so they went with these big rifles. The gorillas could actually sense that and feel the danger and fear from these rifle toting guys and they kept a distance. But George Shaler was interested, respectful, really curious and open-hearted towards these amazing creatures and he gathered amazing amount of information. I feel like this captures the essence of the evolutionary attitude that allows us to be in relationship with ourselves and others. It\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d\u2026 not to carry a gun. What To Bring Above The Line Of Awareness This is for each of us today or tomorrow: when we notice the more primitive conditioning coming up, how do we relate to it without judging it? Carl Jung said, \u201cWhatever is not brought to consciousness comes to us as fate.\u201d Now here is the deal: When I meet with people or talk to people on retreat, the ones that are most despairing are the ones that have the fear \u201cI\u2019ll never change.\u201d Does that make sense? \u201cI\u2019m caught in something,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m repeating the patterns,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never get close with other people,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll always end up going back to..,\u201d \u201cpushing people away because I\u2019m grasping\u201d\u2026 In other words, the fear\u00a0 of \u201cI\u2019m going to play out the same patterns.\u201d The only way we can break our patterns is if we\u2019re willing to go without a gun and start deepening our attention. And this is where RAIN comes in, this willingness to really deepen our attention to where the tangles are. In one of his monologues, Jackie Mason is talking to a psychiatrist. His psychiatrist says, \u201cWe are here to understand your unconscious.\u201d And Jackie Mason\u2019s response is, \u201cMy unconscious is none of my business.\u201d It\u2019s really this dedication like out of interest that we want to know. And I often describe it in terms of Joseph Campbell\u2019s image of a circle of awareness with a line going through; whatever is outside of our awareness is below the line. That\u2019s why we keep repeating things and making them our destiny, they\u2019re not in consciousness. Either we have a gun or we just haven\u2019t paid attention. Whatever is above the line is in awareness and therefore we\u2019re not identified, we have a choice. So let\u2019s take a moment and say: Well, what are the key experiences that in general we need to bring above the line so that we can be in loving relationship? The Trance Of Unworthiness I think the first is how quickly we turn on ourselves and what I call \u201cthe trance of unworthiness.\u201d We know we judge ourselves a lot. But what we\u2019re often not aware of is how pervasive that sense of \u201cnot enough\u201d is, how pervasive the sense of falling short is, so that affects everything, it affects every conversation we\u2019re in\u2014in some way we\u2019re monitoring \u201cHow am I doing now?\u201d\u2014and there is often a gap between where we think we should be and what we actually are experiencing in ourselves. There is this sense of \u201cnot enough\u201d or \u201cnot okay.\u201d So, the first thing we bring above the line is we start noticing just how much we are down on ourselves. If we can notice that without adding another judgment of \u201cGod, am I a pathological for being so down on myself?\u201d but just say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s bring that above the line,\u201d because if it\u2019s above the line, we can then work with it to begin to release the pain. For many people it goes on for decades and decades. A friend of mine was with her mother\u2014 she was dying\u2014and the last thing her mother said to her was, \u201cAll my life I thought something was wrong with me.\u201d That was the last thing she said. For my friend it was kind of a wake up because it\u2019s such a tragedy to have that sense of \u201csomething is wrong with me\u201d keeping us small and tight, caught in the \u201cI,\u201d not being able to feel the \u201cwe.\u201d Now, sometimes it\u2019s really acute. Sometimes it\u2019s a feeling of failure and deficiency that\u2019s very core, a deep sense of shame that just absolutely imprisons us. At other times it\u2019s just a background thing that keeps us from really being relaxed and spontaneous and natural. One of the stories that points to that from way back was of a woman who went on vacation to New England every summer in a same small town where Paul Newman vacationed. Every Sunday, she\u2019d go for her hike and then she\u2019d go to this bakery that had her favorite ice-cream and get herself a double dip chocolate cone or whatever. She walks in one Sunday. The only patron is Paul Newman. And there he is with his famous baby-blue eyes and he smiles graciously and she responds demurely but inside she is saying, \u201cAll right, hold it together, you are a forty-two year old woman, a mother of three, what\u2019s wrong with you, pull yourself together, you are not a teenager, he can tell, just be cool.\u201d She is really getting tight there. And so she goes, she orders her cone, she is trying to do it all smooth and all and she gets the change in one hand and the cone in the other and without direction, she is not even looking at him, she glides out the door. But she gets to her car and she realizes she doesn\u2019t have her cone. \u201cOh no, what did I do?\u201d So she has to go back in, it\u2019s really embarrassing, and it\u2019s not on the cone rack and it\u2019s not with the clerk. And then she looks over at Paul Newman. And his face breaks into that familiar grin and he said, \u201cYou put it in your purse.\u201d So this is one of the more benign versions of the trance of unworthiness. Messy, messy. But benign. Now, we don\u2019t only get caught in the trance of unworthiness. We also get caught in the trance of superiority which is a kind of a sense of arrogance and inflation and being special. The majority of people in this world think they are more intelligent than other people. So it\u2019s there, too. We kind of often swing from being special and important to being nobody and nothing. Life Force In Waiting The point is this that the more wounding we have, the more we\u2019re not given what we needed early on, the more we tighten into \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cI\u201d feels bad about itself. That\u2019s the simplest way. And it\u2019s not just wounding from our family or parents, it\u2019s wounding from our culture because our culture does a really good job at creating tremendous wounding in non-dominant population. The more wounding, the more there\u2019s that defensiveness that has to evolve. We get caught in the coverings because we are trying to protect ourselves. What does a child most need when it comes into this world? It needs to be seen and understood\u2014\u201cI get you,\u201d mirroring back \u201cYou are here, you matter\u201d \u2013 and then that what\u2019s seen needs to be loved. These two wings of need, to be understood and loved. When there is no good attachment and those needs are not met, we develop a lot of coverings and get identified with the coverings. One of the analogies I thought really helpful in nature has to do with spores and what spores do. It\u2019s seen in the plant kingdom: When conditions are really harsh and when what\u2019s needed to bloom can\u2019t be found, there are certain plants that become spores. They dampen down and they kind of wall off their life-force in order to survive. It\u2019s a really effective strategy. They have dug up mummies and have found spores in mummies that have survived for thousands of years that then unfolded into plants when they were given the opportunity of nurture, when they got the right conditions. Isn\u2019t that amazing? You don\u2019t have the right conditions of attachment or nurture so you wall off, there is this frozen life-energy, it can last for thousands of years, and then when you are given the right conditions\u2014because life really wants to live\u2014there is that blossoming. So, when children are chronically judged or not listened to or not understood or worse abused, they form a sort of spore, there is a kind of walling off of the unloved parts of themselves. It\u2019s a way of surviving, to shut down certain places that can\u2019t keep evolving, they just endure over time but stay frozen, it\u2019s frozen life-energy. But remember, plant spores are opportunists. They are life force in waiting. And so they are kind of scanning for an opportunity. From Nurturing To Healing We come on meditation or we start sensing relationships or processes that can start actually, in a healthy way, feeding us. When that happens, when the nurturing is really there, then there is this blooming, this waking up, this healing. Many people describe when they start meditating they start feeling all this energy they didn\u2019t feel before, a lot of creativity\u2014 people come on retreats and they want to write books because they have all these books that come up in their mind because there is just all this release of creative energy. Of course, then the idea is to quiet down and write your book a little later, but really settle. To carry this forward, the evolutionary psychologist Cozolino writes that \u201cIt\u2019s not survival of the fittest, it\u2019s survival of the nurtured.\u201d What we need to flourish is mindfulness and compassion, nurturing. Sri Nisargadatta, who is one of my favorite all-time teachers, writes \u201cAll you need is already within you only you must approach yourself with reverence and love. Self-condemnation and self-distrust are grievace errors. Your constant flight from pain and search for pleasure is a sign of the love you bear for yourself. All I plead with you is this: make love of yourself perfect. Deny yourself nothing. Give yourself infinity and eternity and discover that you do not need them. You are beyond.\u201d \u201cAll I plead with you is this: make love of yourself perfect.\u201d What an amazing invitation! And it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cperfect\u201d as if \u201cNow you have another job to do right,\u201d it means just \u201cGive your heart to it.\u201d And this is the ground-level of the book \u201cRadical Compassion\u201d because it\u2019s only when we really dedicate to loving the life here that we can fully release the frozen life that\u2019s been kind of locked up in there, that we can free our hearts. It\u2019s not just offering ourselves love, it\u2019s also being in relationship. There\u2019s a lot of processes for making that love bring us alive.I often call it \u201cspiritual reparenting\u201d just because what we\u2019re learning to do is to bring the love and bring the attention that we didn\u2019t get to the life that\u2019s here. So, here is where RAIN comes in. What Is RAIN? For those of you that are new to RAIN: the acronym is Recognize , Allow , Investigate and Nurture . And those are the four steps. After we do those four steps there\u2019s what\u2019s called \u201cAfter the RAIN\u201d which is a time of just being and getting to know the gold. Here is an example, just very briefly because I\u2019m gonna give you a more full out illustration. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got a holiday approaching. And you\u2019re gonna be with family. And there\u2019s certain places that you know you\u2019re gonna get triggered. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a certain relationship that brings up resentment or anger or anxiety or something. So how to use RAIN? You often have to in some way pull away, have a little time out, but you recognize \u201cOkay, I\u2019m triggered and I\u2019m feeling defensive,\u201d okay, \u201cfeeling angry, feeling hurt.\u201d That\u2019s the R; you just kind of name what\u2019s happening. The A is letting it be there, it\u2019s allowing it. Now, allowing doesn\u2019t mean you like it. Allowing doesn\u2019t mean you embrace it. Allowing just means you\u2019re not pushing it away and you\u2019re not trying to fix it. In some wise way you\u2019re saying, \u201cOkay, this belongs, it\u2019s part of reality, just this moment.\u201d I find the language, \u201cthis belongs\u201d really powerful. \u201cBelong\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna belong even in five minutes. It just means that, right now, this is reality. So allow it. Don\u2019t fight reality. That\u2019s the A. The I\u2014 Investigate \u2014means that, since it\u2019s here let\u2019s investigate; and investigate is not mental. \u201cWell, my mother always criticized me so now when my cousin says such and such it feels like criticism\u2026\u201d you know, it\u2019s not that. Investigate is, \u201cWhere am I feeling this in my body?\u201d It may be that part of investigating is, \u201cI have a belief that I\u2019m worthless and this person is playing into it\u201d but it\u2019s primarily to feel it in your body\u2014your throat, your chest, your belly\u2014to feel it. That\u2019s Investigate, because you are getting in touch. Then Nurture is you sensing: what does this hurt, defended part of me most need in this moment? Maybe it just needs, \u201cHey, listen, you\u2019re okay, it\u2019s going to be okay\u201d\u2014hand on the heart, you know. Maybe it needs just a little message of \u201cI love you, I am with you, I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d Maybe it needs you to imagine your great-grandparent with their hand on your shoulder. Whatever that part needs you kind of nurture. And then you just get still and sense whatever has shifted. Because if you pause long enough to Recognize, Allow, Investigate and even go through a gesture of Nurturing, something biologically, neurologically, in your brain will shift. It won\u2019t be perfect, you won\u2019t feel necessarily liberated, but there will be more access to your more evolved heart-mind, more access to your intelligence and your compassion and your empathy. That\u2019s just a brief encapsulation of RAIN. The key is that when we hit a tangle, we have to be willing to be with it. Make sure you listen to Tara Brach\u2019s 10-minute radical compassion contemplation and meditation on Insight Timer. 3 Stories Of RAIN 1. Buddha And Mara One of the most classic stories from the Buddhist tradition is the Buddha waken through the night under the Bodhi Tree and he had to deal with all the shadow energies which are described in terms of the God Mara\u2014greed, hatred, delusion, shame, anger, whatever\u2014and so Mara would attack through the night and the Buddha kept bringing mindfulness and compassion and when he woke up, all the attacks faded away. But throughout the Buddha\u2019s teaching career, forty years, Mara kept appearing. And the Buddha might be teaching a hundred people gathered in a field and Mara would be lurking around the outskirts and every time the Buddha\u2019s loyal assistant, follower and also his cousin Ananda would get freaked out seeing Mara and he\u2019d go, \u201cOh no! Mara is here, what are we going to do?\u201d But the Buddha\u2019s response was different. Remember: this is Recognize and Allow; he\u2019d say, \u201cOh okay, Mara is here.\u201d \u201cI see you Mara. Come, let\u2019s have tea.\u201d That was his response. And that\u2019s what we are learning to do with all the activated energies that come up when we are caught, when we are reactive, when we are identified with the coverings. \u201cOkay, I see you Mara. Let\u2019s have tea.\u201d That brings it above the line. 2. The Woman Who Felt Unloveable Here is an example of a woman that was very, very caught and how she worked with this. This was a woman who was in recovery from alcoholism. And had huge guilt about the way she injured her teenage daughter who herself was now struggling with anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. And also a lot of guilt around a strain on her marriage. But in addition to guilt she was angry and judgmental at others for making her feel bad about herself. So it was a whole mix. When we worked together any appearance of her harsh inner critic was kind of the signal to do RAIN. The first step for her whenever she\u2019d start hearing that voice telling her how she was an absolute failure was to recognize it\u2014and she would often recognize that she was feeling anger and guilt. The Allowing for her was if she could just breathe with it and say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m staying, this belongs, just breathe with it.\u201d For her investigating she\u2019d start feeling in her body that \u201cbad self\u201d-feeling, the fear and the shame, and for her it had a kind of hollow, aching, sinking feeling in her body. And I asked her how long she had been feeling this. And she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling this for as long as I can remember.\u201d And then she said, \u201cIt\u2019s unlovable. I\u2019m unlovable. I am never enough.\u201d That was when she was really investigating how stuck she was. I said, \u201cWell, what\u2019s it like to witness that you have for your whole life been feeling unlovable and these feelings?\u201d And she began weeping because for her that was the moment\u2014and I think of this as \u201cthe ouch moment\u201d\u2014it was like a soul sadness where she realized how her whole life had been in grip of the trance of unworthiness. Her whole life she had been feeling \u201cSomething is wrong with me.\u201d And how many moments were stolen, how it drove her to alcoholism. These are later recognitions. The last question in Investigating that I asked, \u201cWhat does this young, unlovable place most need?\u201d And it was clear that it needed to be held and nurtured. She crossed both arms, hands on the shoulders, and basically said, \u201cI am here, I am not leaving, I love you.\u201d And then she told me, \u201cThis was hard to do by myself.\u201d And so I said, \u201cWho could help you?\u201d And she said, \u201cMy grandmother.\u201d So, it was like her grandmother was holding her, holding her young self. That was the way it worked for her to nurture. And she sat there like that rocking and nurturing herself with the sense of her grandmother there for a number of minutes. After the RAIN she said, \u201cI\u2019m just feeling a little more space, a little more peace.\u201d And that was about it. It was like this shift from the covering, from being caught in that self that felt so unworthy and guilty and angry to this space that was more peaceful and that could just be holding her inner life. She had to do it many rounds, many, many rounds. But she described the voice of judgment would come up and the big difference was much more quickly she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to believe it.\u201d I want to just pause here and say to you that one of the gifts of RAIN is that you stop having to believe the old things that you believed automatically. It\u2019s one of the gifts: you don\u2019t have to believe your thoughts. So for her, it was that she didn\u2019t have to believe it. And she had many, many rounds of these thoughts coming up and she\u2019d recognize it and allow it and investigate and go like this and realize that who she was was not the story that she was telling herself Some months later\u2014because she had a real stand-off with her daughter, they were not close at all, and she always felt guilty and her daughter was kind of angry and so on\u2014her daughter was upset about something and she put her arm around her. Her daughter would always stiffen and pull away, but she didn\u2019t. Her daughter actually leaned in and collapsed into her and started sobbing. And she told me that through RAIN her heart-space was able to start holding herself so she could hold her daughter in a new way. And I was so touched by that because this is the difference of being caught in the \u201cI\u201d that doesn\u2019t like itself and moving to the belonging of the \u201cwe.\u201d More heart-space. The key in being able to move from the covering to feeling the gold is what I often call a \u201cU-turn.\u201d And I talk about this a lot in \u201cRadical Compassion\u201d. If we want to break out of the patterns and not have them become our destiny we have to pause and move from reacting to something out there to making a U-turn and bringing attention to the life that\u2019s here. And RAIN is a very easy-to-remember tool. And it totally affects how we then respond to our world.

The Army Lieutenant One last short story that I shared over the years because it stayed with me so powerfully about the U-turn is one of an Army lieutenant that had to do anger management training. And built into his course was mindfulness, how to bring attention to what\u2019s going on inside you for anger management. One evening he went to a supermarket and he fills up his cart, he gets into line, the woman in front of him only has one item but she is not in the express line, she is in his line, and not only that, she and the clerk start talking and playing with the child and so on. And his anger flares up, so he is in the covering now of the golden Buddha, he is completely caught and identified with his anger, this is the primitive mind going, and, you know, \u201cI\u2019m a busy person and they\u2019re just hanging out and talking and I\u2019ve got things to do and places to go\u2026\u201d and he is kind of getting the whole head of steam. And he goes, \u201cOh yeah, mindfulness\u201d and he does the U-turn, \u201cOkay, recognizing, okay, what\u2019s going on? Angry, angry. Okay, let it be there. Deepening attention. Investigating: okay, there is a clutch. Okay, that fear of my life falling apart if I don\u2019t get everything done\u201d \u2013 you know that one \u2013 \u201ckind attention, just be with it, kind, kind.\u201d Then he looks and sees the little girl and notices that she is really kind of cute. So finally, the woman and the child leave, it\u2019s his turn, and he says to the clerk, \u201cYou know that little girl was adorable.\u201d Clerk beams. She says \u201cOh that\u2019s my little girl. Actually my husband was killed last year in Afghanistan and my mom brings my baby over twice a day so we\u2019ve a little time to be together.\u201d For this man just to imagine that he could have carried on being angry and never have seen a deeper reality both in himself and in the world. And it\u2019s not like everybody we meet has had that major drama but, you know, everyone we meet is struggling hard. And what if we could move through our day and pause enough and make that U-turn kind of come back to our own heart and presence so that when we run into others we see past the plaster clay covering and we see who is there and we respond to our world. Practicing RAIN With that in mind we\u2019ll just take a few moments now. We\u2019ll do a brief practice of RAIN and I\u2019d like to invite you to take a longer time if you haven\u2019t been doing this to explore it for yourself.

By Tricycle Dec 28, 2019 Tricycle is pleased to offer the Tricycle Talks podcast for free. If you would like to support this offering, please consider donating . Thank you! Many of us struggle to silence our inner critic on a daily basis. According to meditation teacher Tara Brach, that\u2019s because we are living in a \u201ctrance of unworthiness,\u201d and are addicted to self-judgment. In her new book, Radical Compassion: Learning To Love Yourself and Your World with The Practice of RAIN ( Viking. December 31, 2019 ) , Tara offers a path to overcoming our most entrenched negative self-talk. Tara is the founder of the Insight Meditation Community of Washington, D.C., and a clinical psychologist who has been at the forefront of blending Buddhist meditation and therapeutic methods. She is also a best-selling author and hosts the popular Tara Brach meditation podcast. Tara is perhaps best known for her teachings on RAIN , an acronym that stands for Recognize, Acceptance, Investigation, and Nurturing, and describes a method for applying mindfulness to difficult emotions. In Radical Compassion , she focuses on using RAIN to cultivate compassion\u2014beginning with compassion for ourselves. Here, Tricycle Editor and Publisher James Shaheen sit down with Tara, to discuss how we can use RAIN to break our addiction to self-judgment by becoming more aware of the ways we react and relaxing our identification with our feelings.

      "content_text": "Practice the RAIN Meditation with Tara Brach In her new book, Tara Brach helps break a trail through the dense forest of anxiety with the practice of RAIN. By Tara Brach December 18, 2019 Guided Meditations Stocksy We all get lost in the dense forest of our lives, entangled in incessant worry and planning, in judgments of others, and in our busy striving to meet demands and solve problems. When we\u2019re caught in that thicket, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what matters most. We forget how much we long to be kind and openhearted. We forget our ties to this sacred earth and to all living beings. And in a deep way, we forget who we are. My dense forest hums with a background mantra: There\u2019s not enough time . I know I\u2019m not alone; many of us speed through the day, anxiously crossing tasks off the list. This often comes hand in hand with feeling beleaguered, annoyed at interruptions, and worried about what\u2019s around the corner. My anxiety escalates when I\u2019m preparing for an upcoming teaching event. I remember an afternoon some years ago when I was in last-minute mode. I was madly searching through my very disorganized electronic files, trying to find material for a talk I\u2019d be giving that evening on loving-kindness. Much like the files, my mind was stirred up and muddy. At one point, my 83-year-old mother, who had come to live with my husband, Jonathan, and me, popped into my office. She started to tell me about an article she liked from The New Yorker . But seeing me glued to the computer screen (and probably frowning), she quietly placed the magazine on my desk and left. As I turned to watch her retreat, something in me just stopped. She often came by for a casual chat, and now I was struck by the reality that\u00a0she wouldn\u2019t always be around for these companionable moments. And then I was struck again: Here I was, ignoring my mom and mentally scurrying around to compose a talk on love! When we\u2019re caught in that thicket, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what matters most. We forget how much we long to be kind and openhearted. This wasn\u2019t the first time I was jarred by forgetting what mattered. During that first year my mom lived with us, I repeatedly felt squeezed by the additional demands on my time. Often when we had dinner together, I\u2019d be looking for the break in the conversation when I could excuse myself and get back to work. Or we\u2019d be on errands or going to one of her doctor\u2019s appointments, and rather than enjoying her company, I\u2019d be fixated on how quickly we could get everything done. Our time together often felt obligatory: She was lonely and I was the main person around. While she didn\u2019t guilt-trip me\u2014she was grateful for whatever time I offered\u2014I felt guilty. And then when I\u2019d slow down some, I also felt deep sadness. That afternoon in my office, I decided to take a time-out and call on RAIN to help me deal with my anxiety about being prepared. I left my desk, went to a comfortable chair, and took a few moments to settle myself before beginning. The first step was simply to Recognize (R) what was going on inside me\u2014the circling of anxious thoughts and guilty feelings. The second step was to Allow (A) what was happening by breathing and letting be. Even though I didn\u2019t like what I was feeling, my intention was not to fix or change anything and, just as important, not to judge myself for feeling anxious or guilty. Allowing made it possible to collect and deepen my attention before starting the third step: to Investigate (I) what felt most difficult. Now, with interest, I directed my attention to the feelings of anxiety in my body\u2014physical tightness, pulling and pressure around my heart. I asked the anxious part of me what it was believing, and the answer was deeply familiar: It believed I was going to fail. If I didn\u2019t have every teaching and story fleshed out in advance, I\u2019d do a bad job and let people down. But that same anxiety made me unavailable to my mother, so I was also failing someone I loved dearly. As I became conscious of these pulls of guilt and fear, I continued to investigate, contacting that torn, anxious part of myself. I asked, \u201cWhat do you most need right now?\u201d I could immediately sense that it needed care and reassurance that I was not going to fail in any real way. It needed to trust that the teachings would flow through me, and to trust the love that flows between my mother and me. I\u2019d arrived at the fourth step of RAIN, Nurture (N) , and I sent a gentle message inward, directly to that anxious part: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart. You\u2019ll be all right; we\u2019ve been through this so many times before\u2026trying to come through on all fronts.\u201d I could feel a warm, comforting energy spreading through my body. Then there was a distinct shift: My heart softened a bit, my shoulders relaxed, and my mind felt more clear and open. I sat still for another minute or two and let myself rest in this clearing, rather than quickly jumping back into work. The Benefits of RAIN My pause for RAIN took only a few minutes, but it made a big difference. When I returned to my desk, I was no longer caught inside the story line that something bad was around the corner. Now that I wasn\u2019t tight with anxiety, my thoughts and notes began to flow, and I remembered a story that was perfect for the talk. Pausing for RAIN had enabled me to reengage with the clarity and openheartedness that I hoped to talk about that evening. And later that afternoon, my mom and I took a short, sweet walk in the woods, arms linked. Since then, I\u2019ve done a brief version of RAIN with anxiety countless times. My anxiety hasn\u2019t gone away, but something fundamental has changed. The anxiety doesn\u2019t take over. I don\u2019t get lost in the dense forest of trance. Instead, when I pause and then shift my attention from my story about getting things done to my actual experience in my body and heart, there\u2019s a spontaneous shift to increased presence and kindness. Often I\u2019ll keep working, but sometimes I decide to change gears, to step outside and play with my pup, make some tea, or water the plants. There\u2019s more choice. Four years after moving in with Jonathan and me, my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. One afternoon about three weeks before her death, I sat by her bedside reading from a book of short stories we both love. She fell asleep as I was reading, and I sat there watching her resting easily. After some minutes, she woke up and mumbled, \u201cOh, I thought you\u2019d be gone; you have so much to do.\u201d I leaned over, kissed her cheek, and continued to sit with her. She fell back to sleep, a slight smile on her lips. I did have a lot to do. I always have a lot to do. I flashed on being too busy to pause and talk about that New Yorker article, and all those times I\u2019d rushed through our shared dinners, felt dutiful about spending time together and guilty when I saw her walking outside alone. But my practice of RAIN had changed something. In our final years together, I was able to pause and really be there. I was there for making our supersized salads, for walking our dogs by the river, for watching the news, for chatting long after we\u2019d finished a meal. Twenty minutes later, my mother woke up again and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re still here.\u201d I took her hand and she soon drifted off. I began crying silently, and something in her was attuned because she squeezed my hand. Oh, I\u2019d miss her terribly. But my tears were also tears of gratitude for all the moments we lived together. And for the clearings that made this possible. On the day of her death, I was filled with immense sorrow and love, but no regrets. Practice the RAIN Meditation with Tara Brach Practice the RAIN Meditation with Tara Brach 11:42 Sitting quietly, close your eyes and take a few full breaths. Bring to mind a current situation in which you feel stuck, one that elicits a difficult reaction, such as anger or fear, shame or hopelessness. It may be a conflict with a family member, a chronic sickness, a failure at work, the pain of an addiction, a conversation you now regret. Take some moments to enter the experience\u2014visualizing the scene or situation, remembering the words spoken, sensing the most distressing moments. R\u2014Recognize What Is Happening As you reflect on the situation, ask yourself, \u201cWhat is happen\u00ading inside me right now?\u201d What sensations are you most aware of? What emotions? Is your mind filled with churning thoughts? Take a moment to become aware of whatever is pre\u00addominant, or the overall emotional tone of the situation. A\u2014Allow Life to Be Just as It Is Send a message to your heart to \u201clet be\u201d this entire experi\u00adence. Find in yourself the willingness to pause and accept that in these moments, \u201cwhat is\u2026is.\u201d You can experiment with mentally whispering words like \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cI consent,\u201d or \u201clet be.\u201d You might find yourself saying yes to a huge inner \u201cno,\u201d to a body and mind painfully contracted in resistance. You might be saying yes to the part of you that is saying, \u201cI hate this!\u201d That\u2019s a natural part of the process. At this point in RAIN, you are simply noticing what is true and intending not to judge, push away, or control anything you find. I\u2014Investigate \u00adwith a Gentle, Curious Attention Bring an interested and kind attention to your experience. Some of the following questions may be helpful. Feel free to experiment with them, varying the sequence and content. What is the worst part of this; what most wants my attention? What is the most difficult/painful thing I am believing? What emotions does this bring up (fear, anger, grief)? Where are my feelings about this strongest in my body? When I assume the facial expression and body posture that best reflect these feelings and emotions, what do I notice? Are these feelings familiar, something I\u2019ve experienced earlier in my life? If the most vulnerable, hurting part of me could communicate, what would it express (words, feelings, images)? How does this part want me to be with it? What does this part most need (from me or from some larger source of love and wisdom)? A final note: Many students initially see \u201cInvestigate\u201d as an invitation to fire up their cognitive skills\u2014analyzing the situation or themselves, identifying the many possible roots of their suffering. While mental exploration may enhance our understanding, opening to our embodied experience is the gateway to healing and freedom. Instead of thinking about what\u2019s going on, keep bringing your attention to your body, directly contacting the felt sense and sen\u00adsations of your most vulnerable place. Once you are fully pres\u00adent, listen for what this place truly needs to begin healing. N\u2014Nurture with Loving Presence As you sense what is needed, what is your natural response? Call\u00ading on the most wise and compassionate part of your being, you might offer yourself a loving message or send a tender embrace inward. You might gently place your hand on your heart. You might visualize a young part of you surrounded in soft, luminous light. You might imagine someone you trust\u2014a parent or pet, a teacher or spiritual figure\u2014holding you with love. Feel free to experiment with ways of befriending your inner life\u2014whether through words or touch, images or energy. Discover what best allows you to feel nurturing, what best allows the part of you that is most vulnerable to feel loved, seen, and/or safe. Spend as much time as you need, offering care inwardly and letting it be received. How RAIN Began by Victoria Dawson Insight meditation teacher Michele McDonald introduced the RAIN practice about 20 years ago, as a way to expand the common view that mindfulness is simply a synonym for paying attention. In identifying the qualities of attention that make up a complete moment of mindfulness, McDonald, who is cofounder of Vipassana Hawaii, coined the acronym RAIN for Recognition of what is going on; Acceptance of the experience, just as it is; Interest in what is happening; and Non-Identification to depersonalize the experience. Over the years, Tara Brach modified and popularized RAIN, shifting the \u201cN\u201d step to Nurture and suggesting non-identification as a product of her revised four steps.

      "content_text": "Coming home to your heart: Tara Brach brings powerful new meditations to the Calm app. Calm News Sleep Nov 20 Written By Calm Editorial Team We're honored to welcome Tara Brach , meditation teacher and author to our evergrowing family of meditation teachers in the Calm app. She\u2019s created 3 meditations to help you train your heart and mind in unconditional and loving presence. One of them is even designed to guide you into a peaceful sleep. Saying Yes to Life Awaken to full aliveness by embracing your moments with a kind, wise and open heart. Relaxed Presence Shift from head to heart, and awaken your capacity for confidence, ease and undefended loving. Letting Go into Sleep Release anxiety and discover a place of inner safety and peace. We sat down with Tara to learn about her mediation journey and ask for a few mindfulness tips! Why did you start meditating? I started taking yoga and meditation classes during junior year of college. I\u2019d been active in the peace, social justice, and human rights movement and realized that, without a shift in consciousness, there could be no authentic societal transformation. This recognition also applied to my personal life. I was caught in what I call the trance of unworthiness and I intuited that meditation would help me relax self-judgment, calm my fears and relate to myself with more kindness.\u00a0 More deeply, I had a spiritual yearning to realize truth and to love more fully, and I sensed that learning to quiet my mind and open my heart would bring true fulfillment. Why do you think it\u2019s important for people to meditate today? Our sickness is homesickness\u2014we are often not at home with ourselves. Instead, we relate inwardly with self-judgment and, often, aversion. As one dying woman put it: \u201cI always thought something was wrong with me.\u201d Our self-doubt and fears of failure block genuine intimacy with others. And on a societal level, un-faced fears fuel a world filled with contempt, anger, mistrust and violence toward those considered different and inferior. To return home\u2014to our hearts and full intelligence\u2014we need a way of quieting our minds, awakening our senses and relating with kindness to what is inside us. This compassionate presence will then naturally extend to others. Even a short amount of meditation each day strengthens the pathway of homecoming and gives us access to increasing confidence and clarity, wisdom and love. Have you ever had any struggles with your practice in the beginning? What do you still struggle with today? My most challenging season was after the birth of my son. I was tired a lot and my practice became spotty. When he was about 3 months old, it became clear that on days when I didn\u2019t practice, I was more down on myself and emotionally reactive. So, I made a deal with myself. I committed to practicing every day, no matter what. But I gave myself a back door: It didn\u2019t matter how long. On many days, simply knowing I could come into stillness, take a few mindful breaths and offer a prayer (this counts!) convinced me to pause. Taking the time each day to come home to presence feels like a gift to the soul. I recommend this commitment to everyone. You teach a meditation based on the acronym RAIN that has become hugely popular amongst mental health professionals and laypeople. What is RAIN and how does it work? We all get stuck in painful emotions like anger, fear and shame, and when we\u2019re stuck, it\u2019s very difficult to call on meditation. RAIN gives us an easy-to-remember tool for awakening mindfulness and self-compassion and applying them to the fear, anger and shame that often control our life. The R of RAIN is Recognize - noticing and naming, to yourself, what is going on when you are reactive. The A is Allow \u2013 pausing and letting your experience be what it is, without adding judgment, or trying to ignore or to make it go away. The I is Investigate - contacting the emotions and vulnerability under your reactivity, learning how they feel and what they most need. The N is Nurture - bringing a caring, compassionate presence to the vulnerability you feel. Nurturing deeply shifts your entire sense of being, opening you to more space, presence and freedom. In the final step\u2014 After the RAIN \u2014 you rest in this compassionate presence and sense how, more than any story of a fearful or deficient self, this is your true home. This is the gift of RAIN: It frees you from the grip of reactive emotions, and guides you to your wisest and most loving self. Those interested will find guided meditations and many other free RAIN resources on my website , and an in-depth exploration of the practice in my upcoming book, Radical Compassion. (Viking 2020) What piece of advice do you wish someone had given you when you started meditating? One piece of advice would be: Don\u2019t believe your thoughts! So much suffering comes from assuming that our thoughts are reality. When we meditate, it\u2019s natural that we repeatedly drift into thinking. The real trap is when our thoughts hook us, and we believe their messages of judgment or blame. Mindfully remembering that thoughts are \u201cjust thoughts\u201d\u2014that they are conditioned sound-bites and image \u2014 reduces their power and gives us much more wisdom in how we navigate our life. A related piece of advice would be: Look for and trust the goodness in yourself and others. We are habituated by our evolutionary negativity bias to fixate on flaws. To counter this and awaken our heart, we need to dedicate ourselves to looking for the brightness, creativity, kindness, aliveness and wisdom that shines through all beings. One of the deepest ways to love someone is to remind them of their goodness\u2026to be a mirror of goodness\u2026it brings it out!

Tara Brach is a leading Western teacher of Buddhist Meditation, emotional healing and spiritual awakening.\u00a0 Tara is a Clinical Psychologist, meditation teacher and Author of Radical Acceptance and True Refuge , two of my favorite books. \u00a0 In addition, Tara Brach, along side Jack Kornfield, co-founded the Awareness Training Institute (ATI) and the Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program (MMTCP) . For me, Tara\u2019s podcast ( tarabrach.com ) was (and is) one of the most important parts of my own personal development and growth. \u00a0For hours I would (and still do) walk the neighborhood while listening to her podcast. \u00a0Tara helped me through some of the hardest times in my life and allowed me to access her tools and wisdom through a freely offered podcast and streaming service that inspired me to create CBTschool.com .\u00a0 Tara taught me to be a fearless mental health advocate, so you may see that much of CBT School follows her goal of offering skillful and generous work. While I was in Washington, DC for the International OCD Foundation conference , I was lucky enough to meet with Tara in person before her Wednesdays with Tara Meditation Talk and ask her some questions about anxiety and mindfulness.\u00a0 I am still freaking out with excitement that I had the opportunity to meet her in person and then get to interview her for the Your Anxiety Toolkit Podcast. My goal for this podcast episode was to zero in to the questions I often get asked and see what Tara\u2019s response would be.\u00a0 True to form, Tara gives us some BEAUTIFUL responses that are easy to understand and apply. In this interview, we talk specifically about how uncertainty can be one of the hardest and most challenging parts of anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) , panic attacks and depression.\u00a0 Tara gives some amazing mindfulness tools to help us approach uncertainty. We also talked about her book, Radical Acceptance and what some of the road blocks are to radically accepting our discomforts or fears. \u00a0If you haven\u2019t read her books, I strongly encourage you to.\u00a0 Tara has a way of bringing compassion into the room, even if she isn\u2019t physically there. Tara gives us tips on how to implement Mindfulness practices into our everyday life and normalizes the struggles we all have with this. One of the questions I was most interested in asking Tara was her advice for those who are deeply suffering with mental health right now.\u00a0 She so beautifully responded with compassion and deep knowledge of mindfulness practice.\u00a0 This answer brought me to tears and I am so grateful for having this experience with her. And, last of all, I just had to ask Tara about why she uses humor in her meditation talks and Tara kindly shared with us one of her favorite jokes.\u00a0 Tara used humor a lot to help us understand our own reactivity or idiosyncrasies and I just loved having a little chuckle with her. So, as you can see, I am just a teeny bit in love with Tara (wink, wink).\u00a0 I really hope you get as much as I did out of this episode. \u00a0 Thank you so much Tara for your kindness and generosity. Ok folks!\u00a0 DO NOT FORGET to stay til the end of the episode because Tara so kindly gives an AMAZING GIFT at the end of the interview for our wonderful CBT School community.

      "content_text": "Tara Brach Is Inspiring Calm and Compassion Across the World \u201cPausing, finding a quiet space, and opening up to the present moment\u00a0exposes us to our unlived life.\u201d Every week in Maria\u2019s publication The Sunday Paper, we honor individuals who are using their voices, their hearts and their minds to Move Humanity Forward. This week, we honor Tara Brach as our\u00a0Architect of Change of the Week. Tara Brach has been helping people find their inner peace for over 40 years. As author of Radical Acceptance and True Refuge , and through classes and workshops in the United States and Europe,\u00a0Tara has not only guided many people toward finding acceptance, freedom and love within themselves. She has also encouraged them to set out and share that compassion with the greater world. We honor her today for the way her teachings are helping to\u00a0Moving Humanity Forward. 1.) How does embracing a state of nothingness help our minds wander and be more creative? When we are busy and task oriented, our attention narrows and our thinking becomes more repetitive, closed and rigid. It\u2019s only when we intentionally stop \u201cdoing\u201d\u2014when we are willing to relax back and simply be\u2014that our minds open to fresh perceptions and understandings. This takes some courage, as our \u201cdoing\u201d gives a false sense of control and initially, letting go can leave us feeling unsettled, anxious or bored. Yet that\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s the space and quietness of non-doing that gives rise to creativity and true wonder. 2.) People often view meditation as simply a way to calm the mind, but what other benefits exist when it comes to play, spontaneity, creativity, and imagination? We delight in children\u2019s playfulness and spontaneity, and might wonder, what happens to squelch it? When we are busy managing our life\u2014consumed by non-stop worries, planning and anxious thoughts\u2014we are in a trance that covers over the mystery that is always here. Meditation awakens us from trance by quieting distracting thoughts, and opening us to the aliveness of our senses. Rather than living in a virtual reality, we are present to feel the warm embrace of a loved one, play tug of war with our pup, take creative risks at work, dance, serve and savor this precious life. 3.) Especially in this digital age, too many of us struggle with the idea of turning off and being alone. What is the value in finding time to be alone and with ourselves? One sage advised that we ask ourselves a revealing question: \u201c What am I unwilling to feel ?\u201d Pausing, finding a quiet space and opening to the present moment, exposes us to our own unlived life.\u00a0 We might contact the unfelt fear or loneliness we\u2019ve been running from, or the sadness or passion. In this pause we also open to the deep vitality and love and intelligence that gets buried when we are plugged into the endless noise and speed and drive of our culture. We are not just pausing for our own sanity and well-being. If we can\u2019t open to our vulnerability, we won\u2019t feel compassion for others. It\u2019s through contacting and embracing our inner life that we can then respond to those around us with increasing wisdom and kindness. 4.) In your book True Refuge , you write that there is a\u00a0place of silent awareness that exists beneath our thoughts and emotions. What are the benefits of tapping into that inner self, and what is one thing a person can do today to get closer to that place? After being with thousands of people at their deathbed, one palliative caregiver described the greatest regret of the dying: \u201cI didn\u2019t live true to myself.\u201d\u00a0 We live according to other\u2019s expectations and our own should\u2019s and fears. Our thoughts and emotions perpetuate the sense that something is wrong with us, a trance of unworthiness that prevents us from relaxing, taking risks and trusting we are loveable. Meditation\u2014training our attention\u2014allows us to discover who we are under the surface waves, who we are beyond the sense of an unworthy self. A simple meditation, what I call a \u201c Pause for Homecoming \u201d helps us get a taste of the wakefulness, love and openness that is at the source of our Being. Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed for 3 to 5 minutes, and sit in a way that allows you to be alert yet comfortable. Experiment with bringing a slight smile to your lips: Closing your eyes, take 3 long, full, deep breaths , matching the length of the inhale with length of the exhale. You might count to 6 breathing in, and 6 breathing out. Let the breath resume its natural rhythm, and become mindful of the present moment : What is it like to listen to sounds? To feel the sensations throughout your body? To sense the emotions or mood of your heart? What is the experience of the presence or awareness that is here? Sense what your deepest wish is for yourself (e.g. May I be happy,\u00a0 may I be peaceful, may I accept myself just as I am, may I love without holding back\u2026) and offer that wish to yourself .\u00a0 If you like you might explore gently putting your hand on your heart as you do this. As you move back into daily activity notice whatever might have shifted in your sense of your own being. 5.) How do you hope your work will continue to Move Humanity Forward? Training in mindfulness and compassion creates the grounds for a more peaceful, loving, just world. Children who have taken mindfulness classes have a way to center, communicate what they are feeling and cultivate self-confidence. Inmates talk about how a meditative pause gives them the choice not to act out of fear and anger. Business leaders describe how mindfulness helps them bring the best out of others, and align their work with their deepest values. Those dialoguing in mixed racial groups become aware of unseen bias and of the essential goodness in each other. The dying can take refuge in timeless loving presence, and earthlings awaken to cherish their larger body, this earth. The hope in sharing these practices, and in training new teachers to do the same, is to contribute to this movement of healing and freedom. For more information on Tara Brach, go here .

      "content_text": "A 10-Minute Meditation on Love Connection Explore this mindfulness practice from Tara Brach for keeping the lines of communication open and maintaining a deep, loving connection. By Tara Brach April 13, 2017 Relationships venimo/Adobe Stock Tara Brach and her husband, meditation teacher Jonathan Foust, have developed a regular practice for keeping the lines of communication open and maintaining a deep, loving connection. They engage in the practice two mornings a week. Here\u2019s how Tara suggests going about it. Mindfulness Practice: Keep the Lines Open 1) Begin by sitting silently together for 10-20 minutes, as time allows. 2) Next, take turns telling each other what you\u2019re grateful for , what\u2019s enlivening your heart at present. \u201cThis is called gladdening the heart and serves as a good way to open the channel of communication,\u201d Tara says. 3) Next, take turns naming any particular challenges you\u2019re dealing with that are currently causing you stress. These are difficulties you\u2019re facing apart from your relationship. 4)\u00a0Then, deepen your inquiry by taking turns noting anything that might be restricting the sense of love and openness you feel toward your partner. First, you might ask yourself: \u201cWhat is between me and feeling openhearted and intimate with my partner?\u201d This is potentially the stickiest part of the practice, as well as the most rewarding. \u201cNaming difficult truths is the best way to bring more love and understanding into a relationship.\u201d \u2014Tara Brach \u201cNaming difficult truths is the best way to bring more love and understanding into a relationship,\u201d explains Tara. For example, she says, \u201cThere are times when I get busy and Jonathan takes on\u00a0a larger portion of the household responsibilities and ends up feeling unappreciated, and I need to be reminded to express my appreciation. When we acknowledge what could cause resentment if left unsaid, it brings us closer together.\u201d But, she cautions, for this step to be productive, it\u2019s essential for both partners to practice speaking and listening from a place of vulnerability , without blaming the other person. 5)\u00a0Next, expand your inquiry to see whether there\u2019s anyone in your wider circle who also calls out for your attention \u2014in your family, friend circle or society at large who\u2019s important to you as an individual or as a couple. Take turns identifying them, and sense what might serve well-being in this larger domain of relationship. 6)\u00a0Lastly, enjoy some moments of silent appreciation together, ideally in a long, tender hug.

      "content_text": "Until eight or nine years ago, I would have said that I was pretty conscious about race; I also would have assumed that Buddhist sanghas were welcoming to everyone. My father was an attorney who practiced a lot of civil rights law, and he had a very racially mixed group of friends, which was quite unusual at the time. In grammar school, I was one of five white kids in an otherwise African American school. I\u2019ve also lived for extended periods of time as an outsider, including wearing religious garb\u2014all-white clothing and a turban\u2014for ten years. So I assumed that I was somewhat awake to these issues, but I got the rug pulled out from under me thanks to some friends of mine in the D.C. area who started letting me know what life was really like for people of color, beyond my bubble of experience. One of them is a friend in a diversity-focused sangha who described driving around with her father when she was growing up. Periodically, he\u2019d be pulled over by the police for nothing, just because he was a Black man. She described how painful it was to see the humiliation he felt every time she witnessed that happen, to know that he felt his dignity was taken away in her eyes. If that had happened to my father, if I had watched him be humiliated like that, it would have shaken my world as a young person. Another friend came to a dharma class where I was talking about raising our children, mirroring their goodness and giving them a sense of confidence in themselves and in their capacity to be all they can be in the world. My friend raised her hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I want to give my son fear. I want him to be afraid, because I am scared to death that he\u2019s going to either get arrested or killed every time he leaves the house.\u201d She didn\u2019t want her son being cocky or oblivious to the risks he faced as a young African American male\u2014she\u2019d rather he be scared and alive. I had assumed that doors would open for my son, that he\u2019d have opportunities and that he could take advantage of those opportunities if he trusted himself. I realized that my assumption was white privilege. We don\u2019t identify other Caucasians by saying, \u201cOh, they\u2019re white\u201d because it\u2019s given that white is the default and everyone else is different. One of the things I\u2019ve noticed when the subject of racism comes up is how white Buddhist practitioners will say, \u201cOh yes, this is important,\u201d but without a feeling that it really involves them, their life, or their spiritual path. And yet, you can\u2019t be part of a population where there has been deep trauma and not be involved. We\u2019re all involved. Slavery in its formal expression may no longer exist in the United States, but there are new strains that we can see in the disparity of access to a host of resources\u2014in education, housing, and jobs. Twice as many Blacks as whites are unemployed in the U.S., and nearly six times as many Blacks as whites are incarcerated. The legacy of racism doesn\u2019t just affect access to resources in our society. It affects our psyche and has a powerful effect on our sense of identity. Those who don\u2019t have easy access to resources commonly face feelings of inferiority, disempowerment, and threat. But what happens if you\u2019re the one who does have access? Identity becomes more unconscious\u2014there is an unconscious sense of privilege and superiority, of being deserving and taking what\u2019s due. It\u2019s very common for white people to refer to others who aren\u2019t white by saying, \u201cThey\u2019re African American\u201d or \u201cThey\u2019re Asian.\u201d We don\u2019t identify other Caucasians by saying, \u201cOh, they\u2019re white\u201d because it\u2019s given that white is the default and everyone else is different. Toni Morrison writes, \u201cIn this country, American means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate.\u201d We do this in the sangha as well. Living in a white-dominant context, white people experience their centrality constantly: in history textbooks, in media advertising, in role models and heroes, in everyday conversations about \u201cgood neighborhoods\u201d and \u201cgood schools,\u201d who\u2019s in them and who\u2019s not. We watch popular TV shows centered around groups of friends who are commonly all white, and we are exposed to religious iconography that shows God, Moses, Jesus, and other key figures as white. And at dharma center after dharma center, we see white Buddhist teachers. If you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t tend to notice this backdrop, but if you\u2019re not white, you do. In order to feel that the trouble \u201cothers\u201d are having isn\u2019t \u201cout there\u201d in the world, separate from us, we have to get close. The trouble is \u201cin here,\u201d and it wants our attention. Shortly after Ferguson, I attended a vigil of grieving mothers in Washington, D.C. There were about fifteen women from all over the country whose sons had been killed by the police. They travelled the nation sharing their stories. One of them told us how her son got shot the day before her birthday. He had been planning her party. Another shared that after her son was shot, he said to the police, \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Why did you shoot me?\u201d One woman\u2019s son was about to get married; another was shot yards from a hospital, but the police refused to take him to the emergency room. These mothers\u2019 stories broke my heart. They would break the heart of anyone who got close enough to listen. As white people, we can live for decades without being exposed to this reality and not care enough to be part of the healing. We have to let our hearts be broken or else we\u2019re going stay in a very insulated identity. We have to pay attention. If white people are going to have the courage and honesty to look at where we\u2019re holding on to dominance or enjoying our privilege, we also have to find a way to forgive ourselves. White people need to be aware of white privilege, to notice how many doors open for us in this life. The current that gives access to money, power, and success supports us; there\u2019s a feeling of fitting in, of being part of the culture that\u2019s on top. And it isn\u2019t just in society out there\u2014it happens in spiritual communities every bit as much. An African American man attending one of our meditation classes for the first time wrote about feeling singled out and unwelcome because he was Black: When I arrived, I was a little early, so I sat down at the end of the second row and began to read a book I had purchased waiting for the meditation. The building slowly filled to capacity and it seemed that by the time the meditation began, every seat in the house was filled except one\u2014the one next to me. I became a little set off by this until the ghost of racist past sat down next to me. He said, \u201cEmpty seats are devoured in this hall, so why am I sitting next to you?\u201d His rap filled my mind with anger and frustration. I ignored and tried to focus on the meditation. I couldn\u2019t. He said, \u201cWhy am I the only person to sit next to you? Do they think you\u2019d rob them?\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s absurd,\u201d I replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think they felt that way.\u201d The ghost responded, \u201cWell, maybe you have an awful smell?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m clean.\u201d \u201cYou look intimidating?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe a forty-one-year-old Black man in dress pants and a button-down creates fear and intimidation.\u201d \u201cIs it because you\u2019re new?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d This situation bothered me for the rest of the evening to the point that I didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t follow the rest of the dharma talk. I remember the teacher announcing that volunteers were needed with the tea and snack table. It was my intention to help out, but I thought to myself: They don\u2019t want a Black man to help. So right after the service was over, the ghost of racist past escorted me out. That was about four years ago. The unusual and beautiful end of the story is that he and I became friends, and he now serves on the board of the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW); he also serves on an advisory committee of people of color that is helping us examine how to evolve IMCW\u2019s culture in a way that is more inclusive, diverse, and equitable. He didn\u2019t go away. But that\u2019s not what usually happens, and I can understand why. It\u2019s painful to know that for all our best intentions, white Buddhist practitioners are missing an awareness not only of what it really means to carry a certain identity but also of how to be sensitive to the impact of that identity. Over the last few decades, we\u2019ve had a handful of teachers of color in our broader community give deeply of themselves in the effort to wake us up, often in the face of a lack of willingness, interest, or understanding among white teachers and practitioners. Part of me is moved to tears by the suffering this perpetuates, but another part is hopeful about sangha and what Martin Luther King, Jr. called \u201cbeloved community.\u201d The legacy of slavery and genocide in the United States, the ways in which white people occupy a place of privilege and dominance that we\u2019re so often blind to, is very particular. It takes effort to know what happened and to know our part in it. But it\u2019s not about shaming people. In fact, one of the things I find inspiring about the very beautiful movements that have been emerging, especially among the frontline communities that make up Black Lives Matter, is the focus on love. For the folks fighting against oppression, self-love is a central force, and that\u2019s true for all of us. We\u2019ve got to love ourselves and each other through this. If white people are going to have the courage and honesty to look at where we\u2019re holding on to dominance or enjoying our privilege, we also have to find a way to forgive ourselves. We are not personally bad; we are part of the collective conditioning. And yet we can be responsible and respond in whatever way is called for. What heals us? What helps awaken us to that space of beloved community? The dharma will do it. We have to learn about the particulars, and we need to engage with others. At our dharma center in Washington, D.C., we have affinity communities: groups for people of color where it\u2019s safe to begin to process the effects of racism, and also white affinity groups. I recently completed a yearlong white-awareness group that deeply impacted my self-understanding and attunement to others. We need to be in spaces where it is safe to speak our truths and examine the identities that have accrued, and then, as we grow more mature and able to speak from wisdom, we need to be with each other in mixed racial groups. We need to be able to name where the hurts are; to be able to name our sorrows and fears; to not be afraid of anger. So often in Buddhist communities, anger is considered bad, but anger is a part of the weather systems that move through our psyches. We have to make room for these emotions, and there are wise ways to do that. So we\u2019ve got to engage with each other. White people need to be in solidarity with those who have been suffering from white dominance. We need to get on their team\u2014not in order to help out \u201cthe other\u201d but because it frees us all. This means that rather than simply trying to bring people of color to our centers, we transform our culture. We extend ourselves by building authentic relationships with people of color and, by engaging as allies, actively support initiatives that undo racism in our society. Recently I was part of a mixed-race teaching team at a Buddhist retreat that was historic in the extent of its diversity. On opening night, when I looked around and saw that nearly half of the people in attendance were people of color, when I felt that richness of being together and the shared intention to wake up, I started to cry. Everything in me knew, This is the community I want to belong to . What heals us? What helps awaken us to that space of beloved community? The dharma will do it. The more we pay attention, the more we\u2019ll recognize the trance of separation and, from a deep longing for connection and freedom, start examining the causes. But that desire needs to become intentional; we have to want to understand the landscape of what has happened in this country and what\u2019s actually shaping our own limited sense of identity. We need to ask ourselves, \u201cWhat is it that I\u2019m not seeing?\u201d And if we sincerely want to know the answer\u2014if we want to wake up\u2014we will open our eyes and our hearts. We will begin to free ourselves from the suffering of separation, act in ways that serve the healing of racism, and discover the blessings of realizing our true belonging with each other.

Try the RAIN Meditation You can take your time and explore the RAIN meditation as a stand-alone practice or move through the steps in a more abbreviated way whenever challenging emotions arise. By Tara Brach February 17, 2023 Meditation Svetlana/Adobe Stock When I was in college, I went off to the mountains for a weekend of hiking with an older, wiser friend of twenty-two. After setting up our tent, we sat by a stream, watching the water swirl around rocks, talking about our lives. At one point she described how she was learning to be \u201cher own best friend .\u201d A wave of sadness came over me, and I broke down sobbing. I was the furthest thing from my own best friend. I was continually harassed by an inner judge who was merciless, nit-picking, demanding, always on the job. My guiding assumption was, \u201cSomething is fundamentally wrong with me,\u201d as I struggled to control and fix what felt like a basically flawed self. Over the last several decades, through my work with tens of thousands of clients and meditation students, I\u2019ve come to see the pain of perceived deficiency as epidemic. It\u2019s like we\u2019re in a trance that causes us to see ourselves as unworthy. Yet, I have seen in my own life, and with countless others, that we can awaken from this trance through practicing mindfulness and self-compassion. We can come to trust the goodness and purity of our hearts. Summary Purpose : This guided meditation uses the sound and imagery of rain to help you settle into a mindful, present state. Core Practice : Tara Brach invites you to notice and embrace the natural rhythms of rain as a metaphor for releasing tension and letting go . You\u2019re encouraged to allow thoughts and emotions to drift by, much like raindrops, cultivating a gentle awareness. How It Works : Listen to or imagine the soothing sound of rain. Focus your attention on the sensory experience, noticing both physical sensations and mental patterns. Embrace a stance of acceptance and compassion toward yourself and your experience. Benefits : Helps reduce stress, deepens your sense of calm, and nurtures a compassionate connection to the present moment. The RAIN Meditation In order to flower, self-compassion depends on honest, direct contact with our own vulnerability. Compassion fully blossoms when we actively offer care to ourselves. To help people address feelings of insecurity and unworthiness, I often introduce mindfulness and compassion through a meditation I call the RAIN of Self-Compassion . The acronym RAIN , first coined by Michele McDonald, is an easy-to-remember tool for practicing mindfulness. The RAIN meditation has four steps: R ecognize what is going on A llow the experience to be there, just as it is I nvestigate with kindness N atural awareness, which comes from not identifying with the experience. Practice the RAIN Meditation with Tara Brach: Practice the RAIN Meditation with Tara Brach 11:42 You can take your time and explore the RAIN meditation as a stand-alone practice or move through the steps in a more abbreviated way whenever challenging emotions arise. R\u2014Recognize What\u2019s Going On Recognizing means consciously acknowledging, in any given moment, the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are affecting us. Like awakening from a dream, the first step out of the trance of unworthiness is simply to recognize that we are stuck, subject to painfully constricting beliefs, emotions, and physical sensations. Common signs of the trance include a critical inner voice, feelings of shame or fear, the squeeze of anxiety or the weight of depression in the body. Different people respond to the sense of unworthiness in different ways. Some might stay busy, trying to prove themselves valuable; others, fearful of failure, may become discouraged or even paralyzed. Still others may resort to addictive behaviors to avoid facing their shame and fear. Any of these strategies can lead to either defensive or aggressive behavior with others, or unhealthy attachment. Some of us are at war with ourselves for decades, never realizing how our self-judgment and self-aversion keep us from finding genuine intimacy with others or enjoying our lives. One palliative caregiver reports that a key regret of the dying is not having been true to themselves. Rather than listening to and trusting our inner life, most of us try to live according to the expectations of others, which we internalize. When we inevitably fall short of the mark, we condemn ourselves. Though it may sound depressing or overwhelming, learning to recognize that we are at war with ourselves is quite empowering. One meditation student described the trance of unworthiness as \u201c\u2026the invisible and toxic gas I am always breathing.\u201d As he became increasingly mindful of his incessant self-judgment and feelings of inadequacy, his aspiration to free himself from his painful inner prison grew. A\u2014Allowing: Taking a Life-Giving Pause Allowing means letting the thoughts, emotions, feelings, or sensations we have recognized simply be there. Typically when we have an unpleasant experience, we react in one of three ways: by piling on the judgment; by numbing ourselves to our feelings; or by focusing our attention elsewhere. For example, we might have the sinking, shameful feeling of having been too harsh in correcting our child. But rather than allowing that feeling, we might blame our partner for not doing his or her part, worry about something completely different, or decide it\u2019s time for a nap. We\u2019re resisting the rawness and unpleasantness of the feeling by withdrawing from the present moment. We allow by simply pausing with the intention to relax our resistance and let the experience be just as it is. Allowing our thoughts, emotions, or bodily sensations simply to be doesn\u2019t mean we agree with our conviction that we\u2019re unworthy. Rather, we honestly acknowledge the presence of our judgment, as well as the painful feelings underneath. Many students I work with support their resolve to let it be by silently offering an encouraging word or phrase to themselves. For instance, you might feel the grip of fear and mentally whisper yes in order to acknowledge and accept the reality of your experience in this moment. Allowing creates a space that enables us to see more deeply into our own being, which, in turn, awakens our caring and helps us make wiser choices in life. Victor Frankel writes, \u201cBetween the stimulus and the response there is a space, and in this space lies our power and our freedom.\u201d Allowing creates a space that enables us to see more deeply into our own being, which, in turn, awakens our caring and helps us make wiser choices in life. For one student, the space of allowing gave her more freedom in the face of urges to binge eat. In the past, whenever she felt restless or anxious at night, she\u2019d start thinking of her favorite food\u2014trail mix\u2014then mindlessly consume a half pound of it before going to bed, disgusted with herself. Learning to recognize the cues and taking a pause interrupted the pattern. While pausing, she would allow herself to feel the tension in her body, her racing heart, the craving. Soon, she began to contact a poignant sense of loneliness buried beneath her anxiety. She found that if she could stay with the loneliness and be gentle with herself, the craving passed. I\u2014Investigating with Kindness Investigating means calling on our natural curiosity\u2014the desire to know truth\u2014and directing a more focused attention to our present experience. Simply pausing to ask, what is happening inside me?, can initiate recognition, but investigation adds a more active and pointed kind of inquiry. You might ask yourself: What most wants attention? How am I experiencing this in my body? Or What am I believing? What does this feeling want from me? You might notice hollowness or shakiness, then discover a sense of unworthiness and shame masked by those feelings. Unless you bring them into awareness, your unconscious beliefs and emotions will control your experience and perpetuate your identification with a limited, deficient self. Poet Dorothy Hunt says that we need a \u201c\u2026heartspace where everything that is, is welcome.\u201d Without such an attitude of unconditional care, there isn\u2019t enough safety and openness for real investigation to take place. About ten years ago I entered a period of chronic illness. During one particularly challenging period of pain and fatigue, I became discouraged and unhappy. In my view I was terrible to be around\u2014impatient, self-absorbed, irritable, gloomy. I began working with the RAIN meditation to recognize these feelings and judgments and to consciously allow the unpleasantness in my body and emotions to just be there. As I began to investigate, I heard an embittered voice: \u201cI hate living like this.\u201d And then a moment later, \u201cI hate myself!\u201d The full toxicity of self-aversion filled me. Not only was I struggling with illness, I was at war with the self-centered, irritable person I believed I had become. Unknowingly, I had turned on myself and was held captive by the trance of unworthiness. But in that moment of recognizing and allowing the suffering of self-hatred, my heart began to soften with compassion. Here\u2019s a story that helps to describe the process I went through. Imagine while walking in the woods you see a small dog sitting by a tree. You bend down to pet it and it suddenly lunges at you, teeth bared. Initially you might be frightened and angry. But then you notice one of its legs is caught in a trap, buried under some leaves. Immediately your mood shifts from anger to concern. You see that the dog\u2019s aggression sprang from vulnerability and pain. This applies to all of us. When we behave in hurtful, reactive ways, it\u2019s because we\u2019re caught in some kind of painful trap. The more we investigate the source of our suffering, the more we cultivate a compassionate heart toward ourselves and others. When I recognized how my leg was in a trap\u2014sickness compounded with self aversion\u2014 my heart filled with sorrow and genuine self-care. The investigating deepened as I gently put my hand over my heart\u2014a gesture of kindness\u2014 and invited whatever other feelings were there to surface. A swell of fear (uncertainty for my future) spread through my chest, followed by an upwelling of grief at losing my health. The sense of self-compassion unfurled fully as I mentally whispered, It\u2019s all right, sweetheart, and consciously offered care to the depths of my vulnerability, just as I would to a dear friend. When the intention to awaken self love and compassion is sincere, the smallest gesture\u2014even if, initially, it feels awkward\u2014 will serve you well. Compassion arises naturally when we mindfully contact our suffering and respond with care. As you practice the RAIN of Self-Compassion, experiment and see which intentional gesture of kindness most helps to soften or open your heart. Many people find healing by gently placing a hand on the heart or cheek; others, in a whispered message of care, or by envisioning being bathed in warm, radiant light. What matters is that once you have investigated and connected with your suffering, respond by offering care to your own heart. When the intention to awaken self love and compassion is sincere, the smallest gesture\u2014even if, initially, it feels awkward\u2014 will serve you well. N\u2014Natural Loving Awareness Natural loving awareness occurs when identification with the small self is loosened. This practice of non-identification means that our sense of who we are is not fused with any limiting emotions, sensations, or stories. We begin to intuit and live from the openness and love that express our natural awareness. Though the first three steps of RAIN require some intentional activity, the N is the treasure: A liberating homecoming to our true nature. There\u2019s nothing to do for this last part of the RAIN meditation; we simply rest in natural awareness. The RAIN of Self-Compassion is not a one-shot meditation, nor is the realization of our natural awareness necessarily full, stable, or enduring. Rather, as you practice you may experience a sense of warmth and openness, a shift in perspective. You can trust this! The RAIN meditation is a practice for life\u2014meeting our doubts and fears with a healing presence. Each time you are willing to slow down and recognize, oh, this is the trance of unworthiness\u2026 this is fear\u2026 this is hurt\u2026this is judgment\u2026, you are poised to de-condition the old habits and limiting self-beliefs that imprison your heart. Gradually, you\u2019ll experience natural loving awareness as the truth of who you are, more than any story you ever told yourself about being \u201cnot good enough\u201d or \u201cbasically flawed.\u201d A friend of mine was sitting with her dying mother while she was in a coma. At one point the mother opened her eyes, looked at her daughter with great lucidity, and said \u201cYou know, all my life I thought something was wrong with me.\u201d She closed her eyes, sank back into a coma and died shortly thereafter. For my friend, her mother\u2019s words were a parting gift. They inspired her to dedicate herself to the mindfulness and self-compassion that frees us. We each have the conditioning to live for long stretches of time imprisoned by a sense of deficiency, cut off from realizing our intrinsic intelligence, aliveness, and love. The greatest blessing we can give ourselves is to recognize the pain of this trance, and regularly offer a cleansing rain of self-compassion to our awakening hearts.

On December, 4, Tara will be leading a three-day retreat at The Garrison Institute in New York, with her husband, Jonathan Foust, called \"Releasing the Barriers To Love: A Pathway to Conscious Relationships.

Do you believe it\u2019s possible to have human relationships without attachment ? TB: I think it\u2019s possible to have experiences of love without attachment, but I think part of our conditioning is to grasp at times, especially when there are unmet needs. It\u2019s part of our nervous system to hold on to where we think those needs will be met. MM: How can we work with that without creating suffering for the other? TB: There\u2019s healthy attachment, like with a mother and child. It\u2019s biologically part of our survival. If attachment then carries forward in a way that\u2019s not healthy, we need to let it be there without making it wrong and bring as compassionate and honest attention to it as possible. Honor that this is part of being human, but it\u2019s important to know when it\u2019s getting in the way. When I\u2019m attached, I find that I don\u2019t see the other person as clearly because I\u2019m more caught up in what I\u2019m wanting. When I watch that attachment happening, I see the beliefs that I have around it. If somebody\u2019s not paying attention to me in a certain way, in my mind, it means they don\u2019t love me or they don\u2019t respect me. Bringing awareness to the beliefs that are underneath the attachment and bringing awareness to the way my body and heart are tightening, helps me wake up and re-inhabit a larger space of being. Holding on and pushing away might be going on but I\u2019m freer to respond in a healthy way. MM: A tenderness is created rather than a separation, which happens a lot in love when we feel we\u2019re not being paid attention to. TB: That\u2019s exactly right. If I\u2019m judging the attachment, myself, or another person, then I create separation. But if I can forgive the attachment in myself and open to the vulnerability that\u2019s underneath it, then rather than fixating on another person to satisfy my need, I\u2019m actually going right to where the needs come from and able to bring a real healing. The mistake we make is that when we\u2019re feeling another person is not treating us in the way that makes us feel secure and loved, we fixate our attention on that person and what\u2019s wrong with them. We also fixate on what\u2019s wrong with us. Instead, we can bring forward two wings of awareness: the wing of mindfulness (noticing what\u2019s going on inside us) and the wing of kindness (compassion to what's going on inside us). Then, we actually begin to heal the wounded place that\u2019s the source of the attaching and the judging. MM: I\u2019d like to talk about healthy detachment rather than disassociation. There\u2019s a misunderstanding in spiritual circles that detachment of the disinterested kind, of the chilly kind, is actually our goal. What is the difference between healthy detachment and disassociation? TB: It\u2019s a really good question and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re bringing it up. A lot of times in spiritual communities, detachment is considered to be an expression of being spiritually evolved when often, we have want and fear around being in relationship with each other. THE BASICS Why Relationships Matter Take our Relationship Satisfaction Test Find a therapist to strengthen relationships The fear side can have us pull away and protect us, but it's really a withdrawal, a disassociation, a cutting off. Rather than the word detachment, I usually use the word non-attachment. That can be wholesome when we care and are completely engaged with each other but are not attached to things being a certain way. I\u2019m not attached to you responding to me, affirming me, or I\u2019m not attached to you paying attention to me in a certain way. That non-attachment gives us the freedom to be exactly who we are. MM: This is connected to the misunderstanding of desire in spiritual circles, where they are often vilified, instead of the clinging and craving that cause suffering. I don\u2019t actually know how you can have a love relationship without desire, not simply sexual desire, but in the true meaning of Eros. TB: I think of desire as the essence that brings forth the whole universe. If it weren\u2019t for desire, the formless would not have come into form and engage creatively. This longing to express and celebrate life is innate and quite beautiful. Where desire ends up causing suffering is when it fixates. When desire for a certain person\u2019s attention becomes an \u201cI have to have\u201d kind of grasping, then identity gets organized around needing that and it becomes very solid and sticky. That causes suffering because we\u2019re not inhabiting the fullness of who we are, we\u2019re fixated and contracted on life being a certain way. Relationships Essential Reads The Science of the \u201cOne Who Got Away\u201d What Is the Average Age Gap in Relationships Worldwide? MM: As a teacher and therapist you must hear a lot of stories about intimacy gone wrong. In your experience, what are some of the misunderstandings about intimacy that cause suffering? TB: Our greatest longing is to be intimate. We want to be in open, loving communion with each other and our greatest fear is intimacy. That it won\u2019t work and we\u2019ll be rejected. I speak a lot about what I call \u201cthe trance of unworthiness\u201d which is really epidemic in our culture, this sense of \u201cI\u2019m not enough,\u201d or \u201csomething\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d Most of us have some level of it because our culture has all these standards (handed down through our families) of what it means to be okay. Most of us grow up with a sense of \u201cI\u2019m not intelligent enough.\u201d It\u2019s such a sad thing that in the West we worship a certain kind of left-brain intelligence . Our kids go to school and they come out feeling not intelligent, not desirable, not attractive or appealing to others. And if they get into loving relationships, they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll be found wanting, won\u2019t have the looks or body shape our culture deems worthy. Many of us feel we\u2019re falling short and if we start feeling close to another person, that we\u2019ll be found out and rejected. The main thing going on around intimacy is that we've developed a lot of strategies so we\u2019ll be a desirable package. I sometimes call this our \u201cspacesuit self\u201d because we come into an environment that is difficult and challenging, where we\u2019re told to be different. We\u2019re told to jump over hoops to be loved and appreciated, so we have to develop spacesuit strategies to get approval and create ways to avoid being judged. The sad thing about it is that we get identified with our spacesuit, our egoic strategies and we lose touch with the authentic being that we are. In intimate relationships, if we start trying to be more real, it\u2019s very scary. We\u2019re so used to presenting ourselves and getting approval according to our achievements that it\u2019s difficult to be authentic and trust that we\u2019ll be accepted just as we are. MM: What\u2019s the role of space in intimacy\u2014the importance of maintaining space between lovers, or anyone, in relationships? TB: People have to find their rhythm. Some people have need for more contact and time together and some people need more space. Allowing another to be as they are is more what I think of as \u201cspace.\u201d The space to express yourself and know that you\u2019re going to be accepted. That\u2019s more where I go than with the actual physical logistics of how much time you have together and how much time you have apart. MM: That\u2019s more what I was thinking, because we have this romantic myth that to be in love means to be joined at the hip, but that doesn\u2019t actually create intimacy, does it? TB: No, it really is more energetic. Telling each other the truth and being who we are, and having space for the other person\u2019s vulnerability in being who they are, allows us to move in a kind of dance together that\u2019s very fluid and graceful. If there\u2019s a demand of being together in a certain way, those expectations and judgements take away from that space and create an edginess and a cramped-ness to the relationship. MM: Andrew Solomon has a wonderful line in The Noonday Demon. He writes: \u201c Depression is the flaw in love. To be creatures who love, we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose, and depression is the mechanism of that despair.\u201d Do you think that\u2019s true? TB: My understanding is that to love, we need to be able to totally surrender to the living/dying nature of this world. Everything we love goes. So to be able to grieve that loss, to let go, to have that grief be absolutely full, is the only way to have our heart be full and open. If we\u2019re not open to losing, we\u2019re not open to loving. I think of depression as the mechanism that pushes down the pain of that loss. It tries to distance us from the loss but it lowers our whole energy level. I think that\u2019s a pervasive way we end up responding to loss or the anticipation of loss. Natural but not necessary. MM: And what role does surrender play in love? TB: Ongoing. Every moment. We are continually experiencing the conditioning to hold on, tighten, or resist. When we experience stress , the nervous system tries to control things. Part of waking up is discovering what we are beyond that controlling organism. Discovering a richer quality of being-ness means to keep surrendering and letting go of resistance. In this moment as we\u2019re communicating, there is a tightening around \u201cIs this the best question to ask?\u201d or \u201cAm I being understood?\u201d To open in a loving way is to let awareness notice that tightening. I\u2019m doing this as I\u2019m speaking with you, noticing \u201cAm I saying this right?\u201d It\u2019s being aware of self-consciousness as a kind of contraction and then surrendering to it. Notice it fully, fully include it in awareness and then relax to open and become that awareness. Then you are no longer identified as that self that\u2019s trying to answer a question. Once we open to awareness, love flows naturally. MM: One last question, Tara. How do you work with someone who fears the risk of love to such an extent that they are afraid to put their toe in the water? What can you recommend? TB: All of us, unless we\u2019re completely awake, have a degree of that. We tense against love and hold on in a way that doesn\u2019t let it flow. When that\u2019s really strong, the key piece to freeing our hearts is self-compassion. I mentioned earlier the two wings of awareness. The first step is recognizing the fear of getting close to others\u2014this honest witnessing of where it is in the body, where it is in your beliefs. The other wing regards what\u2019s seen with kindness and compassion. I often concretize that Mark, by placing my hand on my heart. This is for anyone reading this who wants to explore it. Recognize the thought, \u201cAfraid of loving,\u201d then gently put your hand on your heart to send a message of kindness. It\u2019s the beginning of opening to love. Even if there\u2019s not much feeling of compassion toward oneself, just say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I love you.\u201d Even going through the motions is a way of establishing a new relationship with our inner life that is caring and tender, versus one that is judging, distancing or ignoring. This is the beginning of being capable of intimacy with others. The two wings of mindfulness and kindness will begin to open the heart to more connection with our world.

      "content_text": "The open sky, the scent of pine, the smell of sea\u2014summer in Cape Cod felt to Tara Brach like her true home. As she was growing up, the family\u2019s summerhouse filled with relatives and friends, and later in her life with spouses and new children. For her, happiness was the shared haven of the beach, diving into the waves and somersaulting underwater. But one day in 2005, two carloads of friends and family had to go to the beach without her. For twenty years Brach\u2019s health had been mysteriously and painfully declining. Now she had a diagnosis: an incurable genetic disease affecting her connective tissue. She could no longer run or bike or swim or walk on sand. Watching the cars pull out of the driveway, she cried with grief and loneliness. The ocean would never again be her refuge. \u201cI realized that even if it wasn\u2019t right now, eventually I was going to lose everything,\u201d Brach recalls. \u201cWe all are. So how do we find the inner space of wakefulness and tenderness that\u2019s big enough to hold it all?\u201d In the face of our suffering, many of us turn to quick, numbing fixes\u2014alcohol or television, overeating or shopping. But these never get to the root of our discomfort; their effect doesn\u2019t last and ultimately they may make our problems even worse. In contrast, Buddhism and Western psychotherapy attempt to provide a comprehensive model of the mind and to address human suffering at its deepest level. When asked what she views as the essential common ground between Western psychology and Buddhism, Brach says it\u2019s their understanding that suffering comes from the parts of our being that are not recognized and embraced in the light of awareness. \u201cWhat the two traditions share,\u201d she says, \u201cis shining a light on the rejected, unprocessed parts of the psyche.\u201d Brach is a clinical psychologist, the founder of the Insight Meditation Community of Washington, D.C., and the author of Radical Acceptance . The inspiration for her book, True Refuge , was her illness. When she was mourning the loss of her physical abilities, she became aware of a profound longing to love life no matter what. \u201cI wanted the awakened heart,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich would allow me to embrace this world\u2014the living world, the dying world, the whole thing.\u201d Brach calls that kind of acceptance and inner freedom \u201ctrue refuge.\u201d It\u2019s true, she writes in her book, \u201cbecause it does not depend on anything outside ourselves\u2014a certain situation, a person, a cure, even a particular mood or emotion.\u201d According to Brach, true refuge has three gateways: truth, love, and awareness. \u201cTruth,\u201d explains Brach, \u201cis the understanding or realization that comes out of being present with the life that\u2019s right here and now. Love is bringing presence to the domain of the heart, the domain of relationships, and the realization that arises out of that is interconnectedness. Then awareness is when we bring presence to the formless awakeness that is right here. When we discover the refuge of our own formless being, that\u2019s awareness waking up to itself.\u201d \u201cTruth, love, and awareness\u201d is Brach\u2019s secularized articulation of the three jewels of Buddhism\u2014the teacher, Buddha ; the teaching, dharma ; and the community, sangha . She\u2019s opted for this nonreligious language because she feels the search for true refuge and its three gateways are universal. In the context of Buddhism, truth is dharma, love is sangha, and awareness is Buddha. But in Christian terms, claims Brach, \u201cthe Father is awareness, the Son is the living truth of this moment-to-moment experience, and when awareness and moment-to-moment experience are in relationship, there is love, which is the Holy Ghost.\u201d To help us connect more deeply to our own inner life, with each other, and with the world around us, Brach teaches a technique called RAIN. This acronym, originally coined by Vipassana teacher Michele McDonald, stands for: R ecognize what is happening; A llow life to be just as it is I nvestigate inner experience with kindness; and rest in the N atural state of awareness or nonidentification. In her own life, Brach began regularly implementing RAIN when she realized how much separation she created between herself and others whenever she judged, resented, or blamed people or situations, even subtly. To explain how RAIN is practiced, she offers an example from her own life: Brach went on holiday with her family and found herself \u201cdown on every- body for all their different neuroses, even the family dog for begging at the table.\u201d So she put on her parka, headed outside for a walk, and started with \u201cR,\u201d recognize. Annoyed, irritated, blaming\u2014she recognized how she was feeling. Moving on to \u201cA,\u201d she allowed those feelings to be there, without adding more judgment. Then she engaged in \u201cI\u201d and investigated the tight knot in her chest. \u201cI asked that tight knot what it believed,\u201d says Brach. \u201cAnd its views were that nobody was cooperating with my agenda for having a harmonious time and I was falling short. It believed that my son is the one who\u2019s not doing such-and-such and it\u2019s my fault that so-and-so is not getting along.\u201d Brach breathed into the place that was upset and sent a message of gentleness and kindness inward. That enabled some space, some tenderness, to open up inside. Then the \u201cN\u201d of RAIN\u2014resting in the natural state of awareness\u2014was able to unfold effortlessly. Now when she brought to mind the different members of her family, Brach could still see their neuroses but no longer felt aversion or judgment. These family members were her loved ones. RAIN invites a shift in identity, says Brach. It helps transform an angry, blaming person into a tender presence that gently holds whatever\u2019s going on. \u201cThat\u2019s the gift of Buddhism,\u201d Brach concludes. \u201cThe whole fruit of our path and practice is to wake up from who we thought we were, which is usually separate and deficient in some way, and to rest in the vastness of heart and awareness that is our true nature.\u201d Andrea Miller Andrea Miller is the editor of Lion\u2019s Roar magazine.
