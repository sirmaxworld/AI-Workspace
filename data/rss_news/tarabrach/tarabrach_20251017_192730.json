      "content_text": "In this rich and heartful conversation, I join two dear Buddhist monks \u2014 Ajahn Kovilo and Ajahn Nisabho \u2014 who are in the process of founding Clear Mountain Monastery, a new Buddhist community in the Seattle area. Their bright, warm spirit brings a lighthearted and sincere presence to our dialogue, making this exchange a true joy to share. \n\n\n\nTogether, we explore many dimensions of the spiritual path \u2014 including my own journey of finding refuge during a dark time, the teachers who\u2019ve inspired me, and the teachings that most deeply call to my heart. \n\n\n\nWe also reflect on the practice of RAIN, the dance between directing attention and opening to what\u2019s here, and how compassion and equanimity intertwine to support us in these challenging times.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, we touch into the Pali word sanook \u2014 meaning fun or lightheartedness \u2014 which beautifully captures the spirit of our time together.\n\n\n\nMay this conversation nourish your own trust in the path and remind you of the goodness and joy that are always here, waiting to be discovered.In this talk, we\u2019ll look at:\n\n\n\n\n* how trusting our basic goodness becomes the foundation for intimacy, creativity, and awakening compassion in a suffering world.\n\n\n\n* Tara\u2019s own journey through illness and fear, and how softening around pain opens the heart to freedom and love.\n\n\n\n* the power of the RAIN meditation to transform judgment and reactivity into mindful presence and self-acceptance.\n\n\n\n* how taking a sacred pause helps us step out of the virtual trance and re-enter embodied awareness and connection\n\n\n\n* trusting Buddha-nature \u2014 the radiant goodness that shines through all beings \u2014 as the ultimate refuge in an unraveling world.\n\n\n\n\nAjahn Kovilo and Ajahn Nisabho are part of Clear Mountain Monastery Project, an aspiring Buddhist forest monastery in the Seattle area.\u00a0Website:\u00a0https://www.clearmountainmonastery.org/ YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/ClearMountainMonastery",
