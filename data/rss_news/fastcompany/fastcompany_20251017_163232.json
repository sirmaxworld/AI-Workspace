      "content_text": "\u201cThe gyoza needs to look a little whiter. It\u2019s too pink.\u201d\nNigel Ng is genially micromanaging the look and feel of Fried, an animated series that will premiere on YouTube later this year. His feedback comes during an early planning session at Toonstar, the company producing the show, which is headquartered in a former furniture warehouse in downtown L.A.\u2019s arts district.\nNg has every right to be fussy about Fried\u2019s world. The show represents the cartoon debut of Uncle Roger, the volatile middle-aged Chinese guy he has portrayed in live-action YouTube videos since 2020. They famously depict the character growing agitated as he watches western chefs\u2014such as Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, and Nigella Lawson\u2014botching, by his estimation, the preparation of Asian food. (Especially fried rice.)\nIn his own idiosyncratic way, Uncle Roger is a perfectionist. So is Ng.\n\u201cPeople follow my YouTube channel because they like Uncle Roger,\u201d Ng tells me during a break. \u201cThey like how he thinks, they like how he talks, and the jokes he makes. People can tell it&#8217;s not a decision made by a committee. It\u2019s this one person&#8217;s sense of humor. Probably not the best sense of humor, but it&#8217;s his sense of humor. Doing this animation, I need to bring that ethos.\u201d\n\n\nNigel Ng [Photo: Courtesy Asian Nation (@asian_nation) and @dollyave]\n\n\nDuring the planning meeting, as Ng\u2019s critiques of Fried\u2019s visuals keep coming\u2014spanning subtle details of characters, settings, and other aspects of the production\u2014Toonstar staffers swiftly incorporate them into updated artwork. In many ways, it\u2019s not a radically different process than animation studios employed decades ago. But there\u2019s one crucial new element: The closer the show gets to completion, the more AI will perform much of the heavy lifting.\nThat\u2019s the not-so-secret ingredient at Toonstar, which Hollywood veterans John Attanasio and Luisa Huang cofounded in 2017 after working together at Warner Bros. As much a platform as a studio, it built two proprietary pieces of software that it uses in all its productions. One, Ink &amp; Pixel, uses generative AI to produce much of the art that\u2014once upon a time\u2014would have been handled entirely by humans with pencils and paintbrushes. The other, Spot, uses analytics to help the company figure out how to turn raw ideas into stories that people will actually watch. \u201cIt sounds clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s part art, part science,\u201d says Attanasio, Toonstar\u2019s CEO.\n\n\nEven Fried\u2019s food went through multiple passes of human-rendered art before being generated by Toonstar\u2019s Ink &amp; Pixel software for the show. [Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nNow is as good a moment as any to confront an inescapable fact: Many in Hollywood are instinctively repelled by the very notion of mixing the art of entertainment with the science of AI. They regard it as robbing creative people of jobs and the work of its soul. The web is already bulging with AI slop that confirms their worst fears.\nBut Fried, and other Toonstar properties such as StEvEn &amp; Parker, belie AI-assisted media\u2019s sketchy reputation. They\u2019re hardly mass-produced: Fried\u2019s first season consists of just 12 eight-minute episodes. They\u2019re written by creators, not algorithms. Voices are recorded by actors in a studio (with some use of AI-synthesized dialog for purposes such as filling in pickup lines).\nPerhaps most important, the shows\u2019 visual identities are their own, not LLM-produced offal. Judging from Fried\u2019s preliminary art\u2014I haven\u2019t seen any final footage\u2014it will owe its greatest stylistic debt to hand-drawn TV animation of the Saturday morning sort, leavened with a dash of anime.\nIt\u2019s undeniably true that tiny Toonstar, which employs just 20 people, is using AI to create more animation faster and with fewer staffers. The company sees its technological bent as reflecting a time-honored tradition for the medium, dating to when Walt Disney himself adopted innovations such as sound and Technicolor. The cartoon business also has a long history of shrinking headcounts to control costs, historically by offshoring much of the production to Asian studios as contract labor.\nToday, Hollywood\u2019s titans are ever-more skittish about gambling on properties that aren\u2019t already household names. Toonstar argues that its efficiencies\u2014which include using YouTube as its primary streaming venue\u2014permit it to take greater creative risks. Without the company\u2019s ability to do a lot with a little, something like Fried might never have gotten greenlit in the first place.\u00a0\nIn other words, Toonstar\u2019s goals do not involve wringing the humanity out of its shows. \u201cFundamentally, storytelling is a team effort,\u201d says COO Huang. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting together a band.\u201d In this case, it\u2019s one that\u2019s unafraid to use technology as an accelerant.\n\n\n[Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nYouTube\u2014and beyond\nBacked by investors such as Founders Fund, Greycroft, and Snap, Toonstar has gone through several iterations of what it means to be a tech-forward cartoon maker. They have included using NFTs to let fans get involved in shaping stories. But its current modus operandi came into focus with StEvEn &amp; Parker, the family-friendly saga of two silly young blond-haired brothers.\nDerived, like Fried, from the live-action bits of a social-media comedian\u2014Texas-based TikTok star Parker James\u2014the show became \u201ca bona-fide YouTube hit\u2014it\u2019s in five languages,\u201d says Attanasio. Now, with 3.29 million subscribers, it\u2019s a franchise capable of conquering other media. They include an upcoming smartphone game and, starting next spring, a graphic novel series from Random House.\n\nDistributing StEvEn &amp; Parker on YouTube let it reach an audience without Toonstar needing to cut a deal with a megastreamer such as Netflix or HBO Max. Spinning off games and books gave the property a business model bigger than subsisting on YouTube ad revenue, though Attanasio stresses it\u2019s making good money there. If the company could replicate that formula, it might end up with many multi-platform properties. \u201cThat\u2019s the blueprint,\u201d says Huang.\nWith StEvEn &amp; Parker as precedent, Toonstar grew even keener on identifying creators whose existing ideas held promise as fodder for new shows. Last June, it announced that it was teaming up with WME to find them.\nThe giant talent agency has \u201can incredible roster of digital creators,\u201d says Attanasio. \u201cThey&#8217;ve also got an incredible roster of traditional writers and showrunners. And so the combination of that is really supercharging the creative pipeline and projects that are going to be coming.\u201d Fried is up first.\nThe idea of cartoonifying Uncle Roger originated at Toonstar, but when WME brought it to Ng\u2019s attention, he was instantly amenable. \u201cI&#8217;ve always wanted to do something in the animation world with Uncle Roger, because I feel the character itself lends itself well to being in cartoon form,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when they reached out, I was like, \u2018Oh, perfect.\u2019\u201d Like Toonstar, he saw potential for his character to become a business empire unto himself: Already, there are Uncle Roger restaurants in Malaysia.\n\n\nVariations on Uncle Roger, who ended up looking like his middle self from this triptych. [Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nNg grew up watching cartoons. But he knew enough about animation to realize he didn\u2019t know that much about animation. So he studied up on its techniques. \u201cI watched a lot of these YouTube explainers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI had to read what makes good character design, what makes bad character design. And then there&#8217;s that Disney handbook, the 12 rules of animation thing.\u201d\nFortified with this crash course, he was ready to take an active hand in imagining the show. That was a major undertaking. After all, until now, Uncle Roger has basically been Ng wearing an orange polo shirt, ranting at cooking shows, and using catch phrases such as \u201cHaiyaa!\u201d and \u201cFuiyoh!\u201d (His accent has occasionally led people to accuse Ng, who was born in Kuala Lumpur, of stereotyping, and was the subject of a scholarly paper.)\n\nOn Fried, Uncle Roger has a rich backstory. He\u2019s a restaurant owner. His ex-wife, Auntie Helen\u2014oft-referenced in Ng\u2019s comedy\u2014is not yet his ex; the show is set before they split. He has an arch-rival, fellow restaurateur Olivier. There\u2019s a cat named Lucky. Eventually, all of these characters and the environments they inhabit will be rendered by AI, with human oversight and polishing. But first they had to be designed.\n\n\nUncle Roger\u2019s restaurant, in preliminary sketch form. [Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nThat involved a million little decisions. For instance: Should Uncle Roger\u2019s eyes have whites? (No\u2014just pupils.) Should his trademark polo cover his entire torso, or leave a skosh more of his pants visible? (The longer-shirt version made him look too much like a bell when he walked, says Huang.) How should the food look at Olivier\u2019s eatery? (Healthier than it does at Uncle Roger\u2019s place.)\nAI came in handy during these deliberations, because it let Ng and his collaborators quickly look at several options, even in animated form if it helped. At least when I spoke to Ng early in the production process, he claimed not to notice the technology playing much of a role. \u201cThey either beam up some drawings to the screen or they print it out for me,\u201d he explained. But he did find progress happening far quicker than he\u2019d experienced with another Uncle Roger project, a now-shelved live-action sitcom: \u201cThat got optioned in 2021, and then we\u2019d do a draft a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Ng doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a layer of AI between him and his show, that\u2019s kind of the point. With any luck, his experience will bolster Toonstar\u2019s reputation among creators who start out skeptical about the company\u2019s process. \u201cWe&#8217;re very artist-first and story-first,\u201d says Attanasio. \u201cThere\u2019s this compounding effect of creators like Nigel that won&#8217;t work with other AI tools or studios, but he&#8217;ll work with us.\u201d\nEven as Toonstar gets ready to release Fried, Attanasio and Huang say they\u2019re poised to expand further\u2014and faster than they ever could sans AI. Another dozen shows are in various stages of production, with a couple dozen more in the pipeline. \u201cWe have folks that we&#8217;re working with who are very interested in horror as a category,\u201d says Huang. \u201cSuspense thrillers are another. There&#8217;s young adult, maybe more female-led voices.\u201d\nAlso on the horizon: distribution beyond YouTube, which could become another component of the company\u2019s multipronged business strategy. Already, three different streamers have inquired about the possibility of a longer-form StEvEn &amp; Parker series.\n\n\nWhatever happens, entertainment is headed for a period of AI disruption, and Toonstar intends to lean into it. Depending on your frame of reference, the company could be the moment\u2019s Disney, Hanna-Barbera, or Pixar. It will accept any of those comparisons. Yet even at its present scale, it has certain advantages that the iconic cartoon factories of yore couldn\u2019t have imagined.\n\n\n\n\u201dHistorically, animation has taken a very long time to produce and it&#8217;s been very expensive,\u201d says Attanasio. \u201cThose have been the reasons why there hasn&#8217;t been as much produced as we believe there&#8217;s a market for. There\u2019s an audience for more. There are more genres you can do. There&#8217;s just a lot more to be done.\u201d",

      "content_text": "October is usually a month for innocent frights and fun scares, but for Bitcoin investors, this month has left many holding the token legitimately fearful. \n\n\n\nIn the last 24 hours alone, the cryptocurrency king has lost nearly 7% of its value. Bitcoin is currently sitting at below $104,000 per token. That\u2019s especially notable considering that the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of more than $126,000 just 12 days ago. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin&#8217;s most recent crash.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tumultuous 2025\n\n\n\nBitcoin has been on a wild ride in 2025. The token began the year with considerable faith from investors, largely due to the incoming Trump administration, which clearly favored cryptocurrencies more than any other presidential administration before it.\n\n\n\nIn the weeks surrounding Trump\u2019s inauguration, Bitcoin spiked, going from a January low of around $91,000 to above $106,000 on the day Trump was sworn in for his second term. \n\n\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs loomed and roiled markets in March and April, Bitcoin slumped, reaching lows of nearly $76,000 at the beginning of April.\n\n\n\nYet, into and over the summer, Bitcoin steadily rose. By August, it had hit a high of over $123,000, and by October 5 of this year, it had hit an all-time high of $126,198.\n\n\n\nSince that all-time high, the token&#8217;s value has been sliding\u2014and Bitcoin\u2019s decline has accelerated in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s behind this recent slide? There seem to be two main factors pulling the token lower recently.\n\n\n\n2 events are weighing Bitcoin down\n\n\n\nThis year has been no stranger to geopolitical uncertainty. Such uncertainty can negatively impact markets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other financial assets. \n\n\n\nThroughout 2025, we\u2019ve had the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas. These conflicts introduce uncertainty into the world, and if there\u2019s one thing investors hate, it\u2019s uncertainty.\n\n\n\nBut recently, another geopolitical uncertainty has arisen: This time, not from a physical conflict but from an economic one. \n\n\n\nEarlier this month, President Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on China after the country introduced new export controls on rare earth elements\u2014minerals vital for industries such as technology and national security due to their importance in electronic devices.\n\n\n\nSo far, neither Trump nor China has backed down, leading investors to fear that the two largest economies on the planet may yet again raise barriers against each other. These barriers could have severe negative knock-on financial effects for both countries.\n\n\n\nBesides the U.S.-China economic conflict, a second event seems to be weighing on Bitcoin. This one is domestic: the continuing U.S. government shutdown. \n\n\n\nThe current shutdown has now lasted 17 days and counting. It began on October 1, with Republicans and Democrats being unable to reach an agreement on funding the federal government.&nbsp; \n\n\n\nOne of the primary issues in the shutdown is the implementation of spending cuts. Republicans want to reduce spending on critical social services, while Democrats want to ensure that funding for healthcare subsidies is included.\n\n\n\nLike the ongoing U.S.-China economic conflict, the continuing U.S. government shutdown breeds uncertainty, which makes investors nervous. And nervous investors tend to sell, rather than buy, in order to lock in gains and hedge against potential further losses in the future.\n\n\n\nGold seems to be the preferred safe haven this time\n\n\n\nParadoxically, investor uncertainty can sometimes benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because cryptocurrencies are sometimes viewed as \u201csafe-haven\u201d assets. These are assets that people turn to during times of economic uncertainty, which often sends traditional stock markets down.\n\n\n\nHowever\u2014so far at least\u2014this time around, investors seem to have gone back into the arms of a more traditional safe-haven asset: gold. \n\n\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down more than 10% in the past month, the price of gold is up more than 18%. As gold rises, some investors who own cryptocurrency may choose to convert their digital token profits into physical gold.\n\n\n\nOver the past 24 hours, during which Bitcoin has fallen nearly 7%, gold has risen by over 1.1%. \n\n\n\nOne ounce of gold is now worth $4,352\u2014nearly an all-time high. The precious metal is up over 9.4% in the last five days alone. During that time, Bitcoin has fallen more than 9%.\n\n\n\nYet Bitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency seeing steep losses in recent days. As of the time of this writing, other major cryptocurrencies are also down significantly in the past 24 hours, including Ethereum, which has fallen more than 8%, and BNB, which has fallen 11.5%.",

      "content_text": "The fortunes of major quantum computing firms turned negative this week as share prices sank\u2014in some cases by double digits.\n\n\n\nThe so-called Quantum Four publicly traded companies\u2014Rigetti Computing, IonQ, Quantum Computing Inc, and D-Wave Quantum\u2014saw their stock prices tumble on Thursday. And as of this writing, all four companies are down even lower in premarket trading on Friday.\n\n\n\nBerkeley, California-based Rigetti (NASDAQ: RGTI) has seen the biggest drop, with its stock price falling almost 15% on Thursday, October 16. As of this writing, the stock was down another 7.65% during the premarket session.\n\n\n\nShares of IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) were down by a similar amount on Thursday, although their 2.23% drop on Friday has not been quite as steep. \n\n\n\nQuantum Computing Inc (NASDAQ: QUBT) fell by 11.73% on Thursday, while D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS) was down 9.65%. \n\n\n\nWhy are quantum computing stocks down?\n\n\n\nThere doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any market-moving negative news specific to the quantum computing space. In fact, D-Wave had just announced on Wednesday a $12 million deal to bring its much-hyped Advantage2 computer to Italy.\n\n\n\nHowever, the broader stock market experienced shocks on Thursday after regional bank Zions Bancorporation accused some of its borrowers of fraud and warned that it would take a large loss, as the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\n\nThis disclosure has sparked fears about the credit health of regional banks more broadly, and those fears appear to be spilling into the markets.\n\n\n\nStock futures were all in retreat on Friday morning as investors continue to digest the news. In the meantime, some may be gravitating toward safe-haven assets like gold, which just set yet another record this week when it topped $4,300 per ounce.\n\n\n\nQuantum computing investors may be profit-taking \n\n\n\nAll four of the major quantum computing firms have had enormous runs over the last 12 months, with shares of Rigetti soaring almost 5,000% over that period.\n\n\n\nWith markets turning negative and troubling signals emerging from the banking sector, it&#8217;s natural that investors in quantum computing might be inclined to sell off some of their shares while profits are high.\n\n\n\nAlthough quantum computers are seen by many experts as a transformative technology that could reshape the industry, the space is still highly speculative, and some have argued that the stocks are currently overvalued. \n\n\n\nWhat happens next is anyone&#8217;s guess.",
