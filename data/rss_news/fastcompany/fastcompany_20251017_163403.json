      "content_text": "\u201cThe gyoza needs to look a little whiter. It\u2019s too pink.\u201d\nNigel Ng is genially micromanaging the look and feel of Fried, an animated series that will premiere on YouTube later this year. His feedback comes during an early planning session at Toonstar, the company producing the show, which is headquartered in a former furniture warehouse in downtown L.A.\u2019s arts district.\nNg has every right to be fussy about Fried\u2019s world. The show represents the cartoon debut of Uncle Roger, the volatile middle-aged Chinese guy he has portrayed in live-action YouTube videos since 2020. They famously depict the character growing agitated as he watches western chefs\u2014such as Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, and Nigella Lawson\u2014botching, by his estimation, the preparation of Asian food. (Especially fried rice.)\nIn his own idiosyncratic way, Uncle Roger is a perfectionist. So is Ng.\n\u201cPeople follow my YouTube channel because they like Uncle Roger,\u201d Ng tells me during a break. \u201cThey like how he thinks, they like how he talks, and the jokes he makes. People can tell it&#8217;s not a decision made by a committee. It\u2019s this one person&#8217;s sense of humor. Probably not the best sense of humor, but it&#8217;s his sense of humor. Doing this animation, I need to bring that ethos.\u201d\n\n\nNigel Ng [Photo: Courtesy Asian Nation (@asian_nation) and @dollyave]\n\n\nDuring the planning meeting, as Ng\u2019s critiques of Fried\u2019s visuals keep coming\u2014spanning subtle details of characters, settings, and other aspects of the production\u2014Toonstar staffers swiftly incorporate them into updated artwork. In many ways, it\u2019s not a radically different process than animation studios employed decades ago. But there\u2019s one crucial new element: The closer the show gets to completion, the more AI will perform much of the heavy lifting.\nThat\u2019s the not-so-secret ingredient at Toonstar, which Hollywood veterans John Attanasio and Luisa Huang cofounded in 2017 after working together at Warner Bros. As much a platform as a studio, it built two proprietary pieces of software that it uses in all its productions. One, Ink &amp; Pixel, uses generative AI to produce much of the art that\u2014once upon a time\u2014would have been handled entirely by humans with pencils and paintbrushes. The other, Spot, uses analytics to help the company figure out how to turn raw ideas into stories that people will actually watch. \u201cIt sounds clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s part art, part science,\u201d says Attanasio, Toonstar\u2019s CEO.\n\n\nEven Fried\u2019s food went through multiple passes of human-rendered art before being generated by Toonstar\u2019s Ink &amp; Pixel software for the show. [Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nNow is as good a moment as any to confront an inescapable fact: Many in Hollywood are instinctively repelled by the very notion of mixing the art of entertainment with the science of AI. They regard it as robbing creative people of jobs and the work of its soul. The web is already bulging with AI slop that confirms their worst fears.\nBut Fried, and other Toonstar properties such as StEvEn &amp; Parker, belie AI-assisted media\u2019s sketchy reputation. They\u2019re hardly mass-produced: Fried\u2019s first season consists of just 12 eight-minute episodes. They\u2019re written by creators, not algorithms. Voices are recorded by actors in a studio (with some use of AI-synthesized dialog for purposes such as filling in pickup lines).\nPerhaps most important, the shows\u2019 visual identities are their own, not LLM-produced offal. Judging from Fried\u2019s preliminary art\u2014I haven\u2019t seen any final footage\u2014it will owe its greatest stylistic debt to hand-drawn TV animation of the Saturday morning sort, leavened with a dash of anime.\nIt\u2019s undeniably true that tiny Toonstar, which employs just 20 people, is using AI to create more animation faster and with fewer staffers. The company sees its technological bent as reflecting a time-honored tradition for the medium, dating to when Walt Disney himself adopted innovations such as sound and Technicolor. The cartoon business also has a long history of shrinking headcounts to control costs, historically by offshoring much of the production to Asian studios as contract labor.\nToday, Hollywood\u2019s titans are ever-more skittish about gambling on properties that aren\u2019t already household names. Toonstar argues that its efficiencies\u2014which include using YouTube as its primary streaming venue\u2014permit it to take greater creative risks. Without the company\u2019s ability to do a lot with a little, something like Fried might never have gotten greenlit in the first place.\u00a0\nIn other words, Toonstar\u2019s goals do not involve wringing the humanity out of its shows. \u201cFundamentally, storytelling is a team effort,\u201d says COO Huang. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting together a band.\u201d In this case, it\u2019s one that\u2019s unafraid to use technology as an accelerant.\n\n\n[Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nYouTube\u2014and beyond\nBacked by investors such as Founders Fund, Greycroft, and Snap, Toonstar has gone through several iterations of what it means to be a tech-forward cartoon maker. They have included using NFTs to let fans get involved in shaping stories. But its current modus operandi came into focus with StEvEn &amp; Parker, the family-friendly saga of two silly young blond-haired brothers.\nDerived, like Fried, from the live-action bits of a social-media comedian\u2014Texas-based TikTok star Parker James\u2014the show became \u201ca bona-fide YouTube hit\u2014it\u2019s in five languages,\u201d says Attanasio. Now, with 3.29 million subscribers, it\u2019s a franchise capable of conquering other media. They include an upcoming smartphone game and, starting next spring, a graphic novel series from Random House.\n\nDistributing StEvEn &amp; Parker on YouTube let it reach an audience without Toonstar needing to cut a deal with a megastreamer such as Netflix or HBO Max. Spinning off games and books gave the property a business model bigger than subsisting on YouTube ad revenue, though Attanasio stresses it\u2019s making good money there. If the company could replicate that formula, it might end up with many multi-platform properties. \u201cThat\u2019s the blueprint,\u201d says Huang.\nWith StEvEn &amp; Parker as precedent, Toonstar grew even keener on identifying creators whose existing ideas held promise as fodder for new shows. Last June, it announced that it was teaming up with WME to find them.\nThe giant talent agency has \u201can incredible roster of digital creators,\u201d says Attanasio. \u201cThey&#8217;ve also got an incredible roster of traditional writers and showrunners. And so the combination of that is really supercharging the creative pipeline and projects that are going to be coming.\u201d Fried is up first.\nThe idea of cartoonifying Uncle Roger originated at Toonstar, but when WME brought it to Ng\u2019s attention, he was instantly amenable. \u201cI&#8217;ve always wanted to do something in the animation world with Uncle Roger, because I feel the character itself lends itself well to being in cartoon form,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when they reached out, I was like, \u2018Oh, perfect.\u2019\u201d Like Toonstar, he saw potential for his character to become a business empire unto himself: Already, there are Uncle Roger restaurants in Malaysia.\n\n\nVariations on Uncle Roger, who ended up looking like his middle self from this triptych. [Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nNg grew up watching cartoons. But he knew enough about animation to realize he didn\u2019t know that much about animation. So he studied up on its techniques. \u201cI watched a lot of these YouTube explainers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI had to read what makes good character design, what makes bad character design. And then there&#8217;s that Disney handbook, the 12 rules of animation thing.\u201d\nFortified with this crash course, he was ready to take an active hand in imagining the show. That was a major undertaking. After all, until now, Uncle Roger has basically been Ng wearing an orange polo shirt, ranting at cooking shows, and using catch phrases such as \u201cHaiyaa!\u201d and \u201cFuiyoh!\u201d (His accent has occasionally led people to accuse Ng, who was born in Kuala Lumpur, of stereotyping, and was the subject of a scholarly paper.)\n\nOn Fried, Uncle Roger has a rich backstory. He\u2019s a restaurant owner. His ex-wife, Auntie Helen\u2014oft-referenced in Ng\u2019s comedy\u2014is not yet his ex; the show is set before they split. He has an arch-rival, fellow restaurateur Olivier. There\u2019s a cat named Lucky. Eventually, all of these characters and the environments they inhabit will be rendered by AI, with human oversight and polishing. But first they had to be designed.\n\n\nUncle Roger\u2019s restaurant, in preliminary sketch form. [Image: Courtesy of Toonstar]\n\n\nThat involved a million little decisions. For instance: Should Uncle Roger\u2019s eyes have whites? (No\u2014just pupils.) Should his trademark polo cover his entire torso, or leave a skosh more of his pants visible? (The longer-shirt version made him look too much like a bell when he walked, says Huang.) How should the food look at Olivier\u2019s eatery? (Healthier than it does at Uncle Roger\u2019s place.)\nAI came in handy during these deliberations, because it let Ng and his collaborators quickly look at several options, even in animated form if it helped. At least when I spoke to Ng early in the production process, he claimed not to notice the technology playing much of a role. \u201cThey either beam up some drawings to the screen or they print it out for me,\u201d he explained. But he did find progress happening far quicker than he\u2019d experienced with another Uncle Roger project, a now-shelved live-action sitcom: \u201cThat got optioned in 2021, and then we\u2019d do a draft a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Ng doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a layer of AI between him and his show, that\u2019s kind of the point. With any luck, his experience will bolster Toonstar\u2019s reputation among creators who start out skeptical about the company\u2019s process. \u201cWe&#8217;re very artist-first and story-first,\u201d says Attanasio. \u201cThere\u2019s this compounding effect of creators like Nigel that won&#8217;t work with other AI tools or studios, but he&#8217;ll work with us.\u201d\nEven as Toonstar gets ready to release Fried, Attanasio and Huang say they\u2019re poised to expand further\u2014and faster than they ever could sans AI. Another dozen shows are in various stages of production, with a couple dozen more in the pipeline. \u201cWe have folks that we&#8217;re working with who are very interested in horror as a category,\u201d says Huang. \u201cSuspense thrillers are another. There&#8217;s young adult, maybe more female-led voices.\u201d\nAlso on the horizon: distribution beyond YouTube, which could become another component of the company\u2019s multipronged business strategy. Already, three different streamers have inquired about the possibility of a longer-form StEvEn &amp; Parker series.\n\n\nWhatever happens, entertainment is headed for a period of AI disruption, and Toonstar intends to lean into it. Depending on your frame of reference, the company could be the moment\u2019s Disney, Hanna-Barbera, or Pixar. It will accept any of those comparisons. Yet even at its present scale, it has certain advantages that the iconic cartoon factories of yore couldn\u2019t have imagined.\n\n\n\n\u201dHistorically, animation has taken a very long time to produce and it&#8217;s been very expensive,\u201d says Attanasio. \u201cThose have been the reasons why there hasn&#8217;t been as much produced as we believe there&#8217;s a market for. There\u2019s an audience for more. There are more genres you can do. There&#8217;s just a lot more to be done.\u201d",

      "content_text": "October is usually a month for innocent frights and fun scares, but for Bitcoin investors, this month has left many holding the token legitimately fearful. \n\n\n\nIn the last 24 hours alone, the cryptocurrency king has lost nearly 7% of its value. Bitcoin is currently sitting at below $104,000 per token. That\u2019s especially notable considering that the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of more than $126,000 just 12 days ago. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin&#8217;s most recent crash.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tumultuous 2025\n\n\n\nBitcoin has been on a wild ride in 2025. The token began the year with considerable faith from investors, largely due to the incoming Trump administration, which clearly favored cryptocurrencies more than any other presidential administration before it.\n\n\n\nIn the weeks surrounding Trump\u2019s inauguration, Bitcoin spiked, going from a January low of around $91,000 to above $106,000 on the day Trump was sworn in for his second term. \n\n\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs loomed and roiled markets in March and April, Bitcoin slumped, reaching lows of nearly $76,000 at the beginning of April.\n\n\n\nYet, into and over the summer, Bitcoin steadily rose. By August, it had hit a high of over $123,000, and by October 5 of this year, it had hit an all-time high of $126,198.\n\n\n\nSince that all-time high, the token&#8217;s value has been sliding\u2014and Bitcoin\u2019s decline has accelerated in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s behind this recent slide? There seem to be two main factors pulling the token lower recently.\n\n\n\n2 events are weighing Bitcoin down\n\n\n\nThis year has been no stranger to geopolitical uncertainty. Such uncertainty can negatively impact markets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other financial assets. \n\n\n\nThroughout 2025, we\u2019ve had the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas. These conflicts introduce uncertainty into the world, and if there\u2019s one thing investors hate, it\u2019s uncertainty.\n\n\n\nBut recently, another geopolitical uncertainty has arisen: This time, not from a physical conflict but from an economic one. \n\n\n\nEarlier this month, President Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on China after the country introduced new export controls on rare earth elements\u2014minerals vital for industries such as technology and national security due to their importance in electronic devices.\n\n\n\nSo far, neither Trump nor China has backed down, leading investors to fear that the two largest economies on the planet may yet again raise barriers against each other. These barriers could have severe negative knock-on financial effects for both countries.\n\n\n\nBesides the U.S.-China economic conflict, a second event seems to be weighing on Bitcoin. This one is domestic: the continuing U.S. government shutdown. \n\n\n\nThe current shutdown has now lasted 17 days and counting. It began on October 1, with Republicans and Democrats being unable to reach an agreement on funding the federal government.&nbsp; \n\n\n\nOne of the primary issues in the shutdown is the implementation of spending cuts. Republicans want to reduce spending on critical social services, while Democrats want to ensure that funding for healthcare subsidies is included.\n\n\n\nLike the ongoing U.S.-China economic conflict, the continuing U.S. government shutdown breeds uncertainty, which makes investors nervous. And nervous investors tend to sell, rather than buy, in order to lock in gains and hedge against potential further losses in the future.\n\n\n\nGold seems to be the preferred safe haven this time\n\n\n\nParadoxically, investor uncertainty can sometimes benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because cryptocurrencies are sometimes viewed as \u201csafe-haven\u201d assets. These are assets that people turn to during times of economic uncertainty, which often sends traditional stock markets down.\n\n\n\nHowever\u2014so far at least\u2014this time around, investors seem to have gone back into the arms of a more traditional safe-haven asset: gold. \n\n\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down more than 10% in the past month, the price of gold is up more than 18%. As gold rises, some investors who own cryptocurrency may choose to convert their digital token profits into physical gold.\n\n\n\nOver the past 24 hours, during which Bitcoin has fallen nearly 7%, gold has risen by over 1.1%. \n\n\n\nOne ounce of gold is now worth $4,352\u2014nearly an all-time high. The precious metal is up over 9.4% in the last five days alone. During that time, Bitcoin has fallen more than 9%.\n\n\n\nYet Bitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency seeing steep losses in recent days. As of the time of this writing, other major cryptocurrencies are also down significantly in the past 24 hours, including Ethereum, which has fallen more than 8%, and BNB, which has fallen 11.5%.",

      "content_text": "The fortunes of major quantum computing firms turned negative this week as share prices sank\u2014in some cases by double digits.\n\n\n\nThe so-called Quantum Four publicly traded companies\u2014Rigetti Computing, IonQ, Quantum Computing Inc, and D-Wave Quantum\u2014saw their stock prices tumble on Thursday. And as of this writing, all four companies are down even lower in premarket trading on Friday.\n\n\n\nBerkeley, California-based Rigetti (NASDAQ: RGTI) has seen the biggest drop, with its stock price falling almost 15% on Thursday, October 16. As of this writing, the stock was down another 7.65% during the premarket session.\n\n\n\nShares of IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) were down by a similar amount on Thursday, although their 2.23% drop on Friday has not been quite as steep. \n\n\n\nQuantum Computing Inc (NASDAQ: QUBT) fell by 11.73% on Thursday, while D-Wave (NYSE: QBTS) was down 9.65%. \n\n\n\nWhy are quantum computing stocks down?\n\n\n\nThere doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any market-moving negative news specific to the quantum computing space. In fact, D-Wave had just announced on Wednesday a $12 million deal to bring its much-hyped Advantage2 computer to Italy.\n\n\n\nHowever, the broader stock market experienced shocks on Thursday after regional bank Zions Bancorporation accused some of its borrowers of fraud and warned that it would take a large loss, as the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\n\nThis disclosure has sparked fears about the credit health of regional banks more broadly, and those fears appear to be spilling into the markets.\n\n\n\nStock futures were all in retreat on Friday morning as investors continue to digest the news. In the meantime, some may be gravitating toward safe-haven assets like gold, which just set yet another record this week when it topped $4,300 per ounce.\n\n\n\nQuantum computing investors may be profit-taking \n\n\n\nAll four of the major quantum computing firms have had enormous runs over the last 12 months, with shares of Rigetti soaring almost 5,000% over that period.\n\n\n\nWith markets turning negative and troubling signals emerging from the banking sector, it&#8217;s natural that investors in quantum computing might be inclined to sell off some of their shares while profits are high.\n\n\n\nAlthough quantum computers are seen by many experts as a transformative technology that could reshape the industry, the space is still highly speculative, and some have argued that the stocks are currently overvalued. \n\n\n\nWhat happens next is anyone&#8217;s guess.",

      "content_text": "Hello again from Fast Company and thanks for reading Plugged In. Before I go any further, a bit of quick self-serving promotion: This week, we published our fifth annual Next Big Things in Tech list. Featuring 137 projects and people in 31 categories, it\u2019s our guide to technologies that are already reshaping business and life in general, with plenty of headroom to go further in the years to come. None of them are the usual suspects\u2014and many have largely flown under the radar. Take a look, and you\u2019ll come away with some discoveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago in this space, I wrote about Sora, OpenAI\u2019s new social network devoted wholly to generating and remixing 10-second synthetic videos. At the time of launch, the company said its guardrails prohibited the inclusion of living celebrities, but also declared that it didn\u2019t plan to police copyright violations unless owners explicitly opted out of granting permission. Consequently, the clips people shared were rife with familiar faces such as Pikachu and SpongeBob.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, that policy gave Hollywood fits. Quickly changing course, OpenAI tweaked its algorithm to reject prompts that clearly reference copyrighted IP. A handful of high-profile Sora members have used its Cameo feature to create shareable AI versions of themselves, including iJustine, Logan Paul, Mark Cuban, and OpenAI\u2019s own Sam Altman. They\u2019re everywhere on the service. But with other current celebs off the table, the Sora-obsessed turned to one of the few remaining available sources of cultural touchstones: dead people.\n\n\n\nThat too has proven controversial. Most notably, the daughters of George Carlin, Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, and Malcolm X have all decried the use of Sora to create synthetic videos of their fathers. \u201cPlease, just stop sending me AI videos of Dad,\u201d wrote Zelda Williams on Instagram. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop.\u201d\n\n\n\nI am sympathetic to their angst. In 2021, a genealogy site called MyHeritage presaged the Sora era by launching a feature called Deep Nostalgia that let you turn old family photographs into brief videos. Out of curiosity, I uploaded a photo of a deceased relative. The moment I saw the results, I regretted having done so. Being constantly exposed to AI simulacrums of your parent created by random strangers must be agonizing.\n\n\n\nIn response to concerns about bad-taste AI resurrections, OpenAI told The Washington Post\u2019s Tatum Hunter and Drew Harwell that it would allow representatives of the \u201crecently deceased\u201d to block Sora depictions. But the company didn\u2019t specify what it considered to be recent.\n\n\n\nWhatever its definition, it\u2019s not going to make everyone happy. The aforementioned famous fathers died anywhere from 1965 (Malcolm X) to 2014 (Williams). They surely won\u2019t fall under a recency exception. Yet the old bit of wisdom \u201ctragedy plus time equals comedy\u201d\u2014which apparently originated with another dead person, comedian Steve Allen\u2014doesn\u2019t always hold true. It depends on the context.\n\n\n\nEven more than a decade later, Robin Williams\u2019s death by suicide still feels like an incalculable tragedy. I have not run across any videos of him on Sora, and would prefer I never do. But I don\u2019t feel the same way about Queen Elizabeth II, who made it to 96 and was spry until her 2022 passing. Actually, I thoroughly enjoyed a jag of Sora remixes that began with a clip of her praising the cheese puffs at Costco (\u201cdelightfully orange\u201d) and went on to show her relishing other delicacies in various venues around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of these clips made me LOL, not figuratively but literally. In fact, the only reason I peruse Sora at all is because an overwhelming percentage of the items in my feed are fanciful and at least aspirationally funny. AI slop of the sort that strives\u2014however clumsily\u2014for realism is scarce on the service. The same is hardly true on other social networks such as Facebook and TikTok, which are infested with machine-generated kindhearted celebrities and cute animals.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Sora is consistently riotous. I\u2019ve scrolled through a lot of videos of MLK\u2014and Mister Rogers, Bob Ross, and others\u2014in which the only point is that they\u2019re mouthing some anodyne term they wouldn\u2019t have used, or talking about Sora itself. That gets tiresome fast, and makes me at least slightly queasy. It might even be slop. It\u2019s just not the sum total of Sora.\n\n\n\nI have not been above making my own Sora videos depicting the departed. Inspired by the fact that Orson Welles once recorded a radio commercial for frozen peas, I prompted for a video depicting him filming such an ad. It came out entertaining, in part because Sora\u2019s version of Welles reminded me of the late John Candy\u2019s wonderful impression of him. Other users remixed the clip into ones showing Welles endorsing everything from twine to camp chairs, starring less and less convincing approximations of the legendary actor-director. Maybe you had to be there. But I found it to be a rewarding if minor act of collaborative creativity, not a regrettable coarsening of the internet.\n\n\n\nAll in all, encouraging people to channel their AI-video-generating energy into clips that are playful, genuinely social, and cordoned off from reality, as Sora does, seems like a positive development to me. Still, I try to show grace toward the feelings of others and would accept more restrictive policies on the use of deceased celebrities. Maybe the service could permit them only if nobody alive ever met the person in question. Cleopatra and Abraham Lincoln would pass that test; Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein would not. (That\u2019s before you get to the fact that the estates of some celebrities have deals with licensing companies that probably aren\u2019t thrilled with Sora\u2019s unauthorized use, such as CMG Worldwide, which represents the Monroe and Einstein estates.)\n\n\n\nIf nothing else, building new guardrails around specific categories of famed individuals no longer with us would be an interesting challenge for some engineer at OpenAI. I can\u2019t see the company investing much effort in it. But in a strange way, it\u2019s done the world a favor by forcing us to confront questions like this while the stakes remain relatively low. AI is only going to get better at deepfaking people, famous and otherwise. Better to figure out how we feel about that now, before the synthetic dead folks are truly indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been reading Plugged In, Fast Company\u2019s weekly tech newsletter from me, global technology editor Harry McCracken.

      "content_text": "We are no longer in the age of the activist CEO. Rather this is an era of strategic silence. Business leaders are being told to lie low and stay in their lane to avoid unwanted attention, including from the White House. In the wake of Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s removal from ABC, CEOs are reportedly turning down press and speaking opportunities. Today, leaders are faced with the question of when to speak up . . . and when to stay strategically silent in order to protect their constituents.\u00a0\n\n\n\nReverend Mariann Budde is an expert on speaking up. She was thrust into the national spotlight during President Trump\u2019s inauguration when she preached a sermon urging him to \u201chave mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.\u201d In the weeks that followed, Budde was publicly criticized by President Trump, and received both hate mail\u2014as well as an overwhelming amount of gratitude for speaking up.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBudde believes bravery can be learned. She is the author of How We Learn to Be Brave, a book about what courage looks like in our lives, and how we can cultivate it. She\u2019ll be releasing an adaptation for younger readers, We Can Be Brave, in late October.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReverend Budde sat down with Fast Company to discuss how leaders should think about speaking up in an environment where doing so has very real consequences.\n\n\n\nIn this paid Premium story, you\u2019ll learn:\n\n\n\n\nReverend Budde\u2019s step-by-step framework for how she decides to speak out\n\n\n\nHow she stays grounded so as not to lose sight of when she should add her voice to a debate\n\n\n\nHer advice for dealing with the aftermath of speaking up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The following conversation has been edited for clarity.]\n\n\n\nHow can leaders distinguish between when it\u2019s necessary to speak up, versus when it\u2019s actually not worth the risk and, in fact, foolhardy?\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s a very important question. And if there were a formula then it would be easy, right? We would all know. And part of the uncertainty and the risk is that we don&#8217;t know.\n\n\n\nIs this an important time\u2014either for our personal integrity, the well-being of others, or the interests of our community or business\u2014to speak out? Is this a time when we have reputational strength and wherewithal to withstand anticipated blowback?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou don&#8217;t have to rise to every occasion, if it&#8217;s not wise. I think in times like this, these are serious questions to ask, because whole constituencies are at risk.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are times when we self-censor or when we step back unnecessarily, out of the anticipation of consequences that may or may not be real. There are dangers when we all take the safe route.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt leaves a big gap for really unhealthy dynamics in society to have free rein. I think we are at risk of seeing some of that now, to be honest.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the cost to society if we all take the safe route?\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, in the beginning, you don&#8217;t see it unless you are near a vulnerable population, which is why proximity to those who are most impacted by the large societal movements is so important. I live in Washington, D.C., and people ask me: What&#8217;s it like in Washington now?\n\n\n\nIt really depends on where you&#8217;re standing. For some people, life is just fine, and for other people, it is a living terror.\n\n\n\nHow do you decide when to use your voice?\n\n\n\nCarefully. I don&#8217;t speak up every day. I did not and I don&#8217;t speak up on everything. I weigh my very limited public impact potential carefully.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI try to stay in my lane, which is where spiritual values that I represent are in alignment with the democratic aspirations of our country. When I speak up, I do so from that foundation, and also from a constituency base that I personally represent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a time when you didn\u2019t speak up and wish you had?\n\n\n\nI wake up almost every day thinking of human inflicted starvation in Gaza. I am asked repeatedly to speak out, and I have done so very rarely, in part because I have very deep ties within the Jewish community here in Washington and in this country.\n\n\n\nI recognize not only the complexity of the situation, but also the impact that things I might say or do. The Archbishop of the Anglican church in Jerusalem asks us sometimes not to say anything because it just makes things worse for them.\n\n\n\nBut I tell you, it doesn&#8217;t feel good to be quiet sometimes. Not that I have any illusions in this particular political environment that I would make a difference, which is another calculation I make: If I have absolutely no chance of affecting change by what I say, I have to decide if it&#8217;s worth the cost.\n\n\n\nYou have spoken up in a very public way that has thrust you into the national spotlight. What was the impact on you personally?\n\n\n\nWell, first of all, it was a very unusual opportunity that was given to me to preach at the post inaugural prayer service. In terms of the upside, that was a privilege. The downside, it was obviously hard. It cost me a lot to think that through.\n\n\n\nI clearly offended the President and his inner circle, and they took the opportunity to make that known and it set in motion an onslaught of reaction for about three weeks. Our entire church was flooded with some pretty mean-spirited and false accusations. So that was the hard part.\n\n\n\nThe other side to it was also a huge outpouring of gratitude, the likes of which I&#8217;ve never experienced. Boxes and boxes of mail\u2014so much we couldn&#8217;t open it. People wrote me letters that began with, \u201cI&#8217;m not a religious person, but I wanted to tell you how much what you said meant to me. Thank you for reminding people that my child is a human.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat advice do you have for people who do want to use their voice in a very public way, such as the way you have? Maybe people such as other leaders?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s very helpful to be grounded. For three or four days, you&#8217;re at the height of all this energy and attention, and then the world goes silent. And it&#8217;s time to take out the garbage and remember that you forgot 17 things on your to-do list.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to remember while there\u2019s a response to you, your life is rooted somewhere else.\n\n\n\nWe&#8217;re not the first generation of Americans to experience significant pulling back from values that we thought had been well-established. It was no picnic in the early 1920s when resegregation was introduced into this country. What did the people do then, and what can we do now?\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s also good to have a sense of humor, and a couple of children around to keep you grounded.\n\n\n\nWe are at a time of deep disconnection and polarization. What does good leadership look like right now, especially if you\u2019re leading people who are deeply divided?\n\n\n\nWe don&#8217;t realize how influenced we have become by the contempt that\u2019s poisoning our society. We can&#8217;t have conversations with people who differ from us in ways that don&#8217;t dehumanize and belittle one another. If we can&#8217;t figure out how to talk to each other across our differences, we will never, ever solve the problems that we&#8217;re facing as a society.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou do have to speak up in the face of hatred and intolerance, but how you do it matters. You have to meet that kind of intolerance with firm conviction and persuasion\u2014and yet not robbing that person of their inherent dignity as well.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to be brave?\n\n\n\nFrom our earliest days as human beings, we have to and are summoned to do things that we have never done before. Stepping into something that is unfamiliar carries some degree of risk, and yet this is the miracle of our existence.\n\n\n\nEven though we&#8217;re afraid, we know exactly what we&#8217;re supposed to do. Sometimes we&#8217;re really excited because we feel like we&#8217;re in our element and we can do this. Other times, we&#8217;re terrified. We don&#8217;t know if we can do it. And we learn sometimes that we can&#8217;t, in fact, do that thing, and we fail.\n\n\n\nThen the most important learning is what is the brave moment after failure or disappointment or making a mistake? I find that the brave or the courageous call in those times is to step up, learn, wipe off whatever humiliation or wounding that happens, and persevere.",

      "content_text": "When brands hire illustrators, animators, or other artists, they typically know what they\u2019re paying for: a defined set of creative assets, delivered on deadline, with clear usage rights.\n\n\n\nBut in the age of generative AI, that\u2019s no longer the whole picture.\n\n\n\nCommissioned artwork is increasingly being used not just in finished campaigns, but as training data to power AI models\u2014models that, in turn, generate new, derivative outputs. Often, this use isn\u2019t spelled out in contracts. It\u2019s not malicious. It\u2019s just . . . new.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s left brands, agencies, and artists in a tricky spot\u2014trying to apply old licensing logic to a new generation of tools. The result is a growing disconnect between how creative work is made, how it\u2019s used, and how it\u2019s paid for.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s needed isn\u2019t a philosophical debate about machine creativity. It\u2019s a practical framework\u2014one flexible enough for fast-moving teams, but structured enough to protect the humans still at the heart of the process.\n\n\n\nThe Creative Loop Has Changed\n\n\n\nTraditionally, artists get paid for what they deliver\u2014a character design, a series of storyboards, a set of icons or illustrations. The license defines where, how long, and in what formats those assets can be used.\n\n\n\nBut as AI workflows become more embedded in creative production, the loop looks different.\n\n\n\nA brand commissions original artwork. That artwork is used not only in campaigns, but to fine-tune a generative model trained to produce content \u201cin the style of\u201d the original work. From there, marketing teams or third-party vendors can generate dozens of variations on demand\u2014without going back to the original artist.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently unethical about this. In many cases, it\u2019s efficient and creatively useful. But if the artist who trained the model isn\u2019t compensated for that secondary use, a value gap opens up. And that gap becomes a reputational risk for the brand\u2014especially as creative professionals, advocacy groups, and consumers become more AI-literate.\n\n\n\nA Shift from Ownership to Participation\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a question of whether AI should be used. That debate is over. The question now is how to ensure the humans who shape the aesthetic intelligence of these systems are fairly recognized and fairly paid.\n\n\n\nOne path forward is to rethink the licensing structure. Instead of defaulting to flat fees for fixed deliverables, brands can structure creative engagements to reflect how derivative value is created over time. That starts by offering two distinct paths: one built around full ownership, and the other designed for ongoing participation.\n\n\n\nIn the ownership model, brands pay a higher up-front fee that covers the rights to train a model, generate derivative outputs, and use those outputs across campaigns without future royalties. It\u2019s clean, comprehensive, and often a fit for fast-scaling companies or complex campaigns with long content tails.\n\n\n\nIn the participation model, brands pay a standard commission fee and then compensate the artist over time, based on how their work is used to generate new content. This might look like a royalty per output, a revenue share, or a pooled licensing structure tied to usage volume\u2014akin to how publishers or music rights organizations operate.\n\n\n\nNeither option is perfect. But both reflect the realities of modern creative work\u2014where original contributions can fuel a long arc of generative production. More importantly, they offer artists a choice in how their labor and influence are valued.\n\n\n\nWhat a Smarter Licensing Framework Looks Like\n\n\n\nFor brands and agencies ready to adopt more transparent compensation models, the good news is this doesn\u2019t require a reinvention of the creative contract. A few key mechanisms, easily added to existing agreements, can bring clarity to how AI-derived work is used and monetized.\n\n\n\nThe first is a Commission-to-Model clause. It makes explicit that commissioned work will be used to train a model, and defines the scope of that use. These clauses can specify what kind of model is being trained, whether third-party partners will have access, and how long the model can be used. Crucially, they establish triggers for expanded use\u2014say, across new business units or global campaigns\u2014that would require a conversation or renewal. Think of it as the AI-era equivalent of a sync license for a song: it clarifies how the \u201csource material\u201d can be extended and scaled.\n\n\n\nNext is a Derivative Use Ladder\u2014a pricing framework that reflects how far an AI-generated asset strays from the original commission. Minor edits or resizes might be included in the base fee. AI-generated variants used within the same campaign could carry a modest uplift. Broader reuse across platforms, regions, or product lines would trigger higher fees or require relicensing. The goal isn\u2019t to over-monetize creativity. It\u2019s to avoid ambiguity and allow both sides to plan with confidence.\n\n\n\nFor brands building longer-term systems, where a model trained on original artwork might generate thousands of outputs, a royalty-bearing model license may be the most aligned. This could take the form of a flat fee per generated asset, a quarterly revenue share, or a pooled royalty structure when multiple artists contribute to a shared model. The mechanics can vary. What matters is the principle: as the system creates more outputs, more value should flow back to the creative source.\n\n\n\nEach of these frameworks can integrate into existing production workflows. But together, they offer something more powerful: a shift in mindset from \u201cwe own what we paid for\u201d to \u201cwe share in what we build together.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat Artists Want (and Brands Can Offer)\n\n\n\nArtists aren\u2019t looking to halt innovation. Most understand the value of generative tools. Many already use them in their own workflows.\n\n\n\nWhat they want is transparency, consent, and a fair share of the value created when their work is used to teach machines.\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean every output requires a payment. But it does mean brands should be prepared to offer clear terms\u2014not just to protect themselves legally, but to build trust with the creative talent they rely on.\n\n\n\nA Reputation-Forward Approach to AI\n\n\n\nAs generative AI becomes normalized in creative production, scrutiny is rising: lawsuits over unlicensed training data, open letters from illustrators, AI-generated brand work that backfires online.\n\n\n\nIn this environment, it\u2019s no longer enough to stay quiet and hope no one asks. Responsible AI use is becoming part of a brand\u2019s public posture. A clear, fair compensation model for human contributors isn\u2019t just ethically sound\u2014it\u2019s reputationally smart.\n\n\n\nPut simply: compensating the people who make your model smarter is good business.\n\n\n\nPay the Source\n\n\n\nThe creative economy is shifting\u2014from artifact to algorithm, from fixed deliverables to living systems, from single commissions to ongoing creative loops.\n\n\n\nIn that new reality, we need new rules.\n\n\n\nPaying the source isn\u2019t about holding onto the past. It\u2019s about designing a future where artists, technologists, and brands can build together, with clarity and trust.\n\n\n\nThat future is already arriving. The only question is whether we meet it with contracts that reflect the tools we use\u2014or keep pretending the old ones are enough.",

      "content_text": "Logan Ivey has tried everything to cut down on his screen time. He bought a modern \u201cdumbphone\u201d that\u2019s designed to be used as little as possible, tried a device called a Brick that removes distracting apps and notifications from a smartphone, and even resorted to a classic flip phone when all else failed. Still, nothing was working. So he turned his iPhone into a 6-pound weight.\n\n\n\nThe 6 Pound Phone Case is a bulky, stainless steel contraption designed to make your smartphone extremely annoying to use. Inspired by the aesthetics of an \u201980s brick phone, the case transforms a typical, ultra-portable iPhone into a cumbersome eyesore\u2014and that\u2019s the whole point. Ivey, who has been using the case for the past two months, says it has helped cut his screen time in half. Currently, the 6 Pound Phone Case is just a prototype, but Ivey is raising money through a Kickstarter page to sell a small batch of the cases for a whopping $210 each (the hefty price tag, he says, is due to the high manufacturing costs and current tariffs on steel).\n\n\n\n[Photo: Matter Neuroscience]\n\n\n\nIvey\u2019s invention is the latest in a recent series of out-there projects designed to help smartphone users \u201chack\u201d their brains into cutting the doomscroll short. In the late 2010s, dumbphones enjoyed a spike in popularity\u2014but since then, many users have met with the unfortunate reality that they need smartphone functions like maps, Google, email, and other services to navigate the day-to-day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCreative minds have thought up all kinds of solutions to this conundrum, including an app that forces you to literally touch grass before you scroll, a phone case that doubles as a tiny screen, and an app that uses an animated bean character to guilt-trip you out of going on social media. The 6 Pound Phone Case is the newest addition to this wacky smartphone detox lineup\u2014and it might just be the most effective.\n\n\n\n[Photo: Matter Neuroscience]\n\n\n\nDesigning a 6-Pound Phone Case\n\n\n\nIvey uses social media for a living. He\u2019s both an independent creator and a full-time social media producer for Matter Neuroscience, a company he describes as dedicated to \u201cbridging the gap between everyday behavior and molecular science.\u201d Part of Matter Neuroscience\u2019s mission has included building an app that lets users track their emotions every week to understand what kind of behaviors drive happiness. Through this project, Ivey says, he realized just how much his phone was sapping his energy and blocking his \u201cfeel-good neurotransmitters.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter trying dumbphones, a flip phone, and app blockers, Ivey realized that, especially given his job in social media, it was just too inconvenient to try replacing his smartphone. Instead,  he needed a way to make his iPhone feel more like a tool than an addictive pastime.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Matter Neuroscience]\n\n\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018How can I keep all the functionality of my phone, but still use it less?\u2019\u201d Ivey says. \u201cThen I thought, like, What if my phone was just really heavy and inconvenient to use?\u201d\n\n\n\nMatter Neuroscience partnered with Ivey to help make the idea reality. He turned to the clunky form factor of an \u201980s brick phone as inspiration, designing a case with one flat surface and two jutting rectangles on its top and bottom. Cutouts for charging, volume buttons, power, and a tapered camera hole keep every part of the phone functional\u2014but its stainless steel construction, which can be removed only by unscrewing four screws with an Allen wrench, makes it physically difficult to hold for too long.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt 6 pounds, your hands and arms physically get tired while using it,\u201d the case\u2019s Kickstarter page reads. \u201cThat fatigue reminds you to put the phone down.\u201d Further, it adds, the case\u2019s size is inconveniently big, purposefully preventing the user from tucking it in their pocket. \u201cYou have to carry it in a bag like a laptop, or leave it in another room. That means fewer phantom notifications, fewer sidewalk swipes, and fewer brain rot sessions while pooping (and maybe less hemorrhoids).\u201d\n\n\n\n[Image: courtesy Logan Ivey]\n\n\n\nIn Ivey\u2019s experience, the 6 Pound Phone Case has cut his screen time from four and a half hours per week to just two. While Ivey does hope to sell some of the cases through his Kickstarter with Matter Neuroscience, he doesn\u2019t have plans to patent the design, and sees it as a concept that could have genuine potential for other phone case companies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose little moments in life where you just instinctively reach for your phone, I don&#8217;t do anymore,\u201d Ivey says, \u201cbecause I either don&#8217;t have it on me or it&#8217;s too heavy.\u201d",

      "content_text": "If you&#8217;ve noticed that the internet feels different lately\u2014more cluttered, harder to navigate\u2014you\u2019re not imagining it. The system is breaking down in real time, and by 2026, researchers predict that 90% of web content will be AI-generated. Quality journalism is disappearing behind paywalls while feeds fill with noise designed purely to capture attention. An innovation that was supposed to democratize information is now drowning us in it.\n\n\n\nI know this intimately because I helped build it. As founder of AppNexus, which sold to AT&amp;T for $1.6 billion, and former CTO of Right Media, I created the technology that became the backbone of digital advertising, a multibillion-dollar industry and the economic engine funding everything from major newsrooms to niche blogs. Now that engine is stalling.\n\n\n\nYou are now the product\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: instead of paying for what you have actually read or watched, the advertising system turned you into the product. Every click, search, and scroll got auctioned to the highest bidder. You became the currency. And once the dollars followed your data rather than content quality, the value of real information slipped into the background.\n\n\n\nThe effects are everywhere. News organizations are consolidating rapidly or shuttering entirely. AI-generated slop is creeping into YouTube and other online communities, and flooding search results with spam. Trust in the media and the online ecosystem is on the brink of collapse. Shoes chase you around the internet, misinformation spreads faster than facts, and billions vanish to fraud. It feels like the end. But I\u2019ve seen this before.\n\n\n\nA recurring pattern\n\n\n\nThe internet has a pattern: it breaks, people panic, and then it is rebuilt into something much better. Web 1.0 gave us static pages and basic connectivity. Web 2.0 brought user-generated content and social interaction\u2014but not before people warned it would destroy traditional media entirely. Each transition looked catastrophic while it was happening. Remember when mobile first arrived? Mobile websites were impossible to read. Ads covered half your screen. Everything required pinch-to-zoom and patience. Companies spent years trying to shove desktop experiences onto phones before they figured out that mobile needed its own infrastructure. It felt broken and annoying, until it didn\u2019t. With phones constantly in hand and the first screen for most people, we barely remember the awkward transition.\n\n\n\nAnother phase\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re in that awkward phase again. Our attention is fragmented across more platforms, devices, and channels than ever. We seek information and entertainment everywhere, and we have higher expectations: we want access without annoyance, quality without cost, personalization without intrusion. The current infrastructure wasn\u2019t built for this reality.\n\n\n\nNow, AI has cascaded into everything. It\u2019s generating slop that\u2019s flooding search results and feeds, yes, but it\u2019s also the tool we\u2019re using to rebuild. We are reorganizing our lives around it: how we work, how we find information, how we consume content. What some are calling the &#8220;agentic AI economy&#8221;\u2014where AI is integrated as an intelligent intermediary that reasons, plans, and acts to solve problems\u2014is starting to take shape. The internet\u2019s infrastructure will be fine once it catches up to that shift and the industry rethinks its fundamental economics.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCourse correction\n\n\n\nLicensing deals, revenue sharing, and \u201cpay-per-crawl\u201d compensation models are taking shape to course correct and ensure publishers start to be paid for their value and those will continue to evolve as the industry sees what sticks. Meanwhile, AI companies themselves, OpenAI being the most recent, are investing in advertising infrastructure, recognizing that if chat and AI engines are here to stay as primary channels, they need sustainable business models beyond subscriptions.\n\n\n\nNew targeting approaches leveraging agentic AI are also on the horizon, offering the promise of eliminating waste and fraud that would otherwise go toward funding made-for-advertising websites or AI slop. Companies like mine, Scope3, offer \u201cagentic advertising,\u201d using AI agents to match ads to specific content themes and values rather than relying on personal data or demographics.\n\n\n\nTry this: copy a page you\u2019ve browsed and paste it into ChatGPT, then ask it to produce an ad and compare the result to what\u2019s actually on the page. More likely than not, ChatGPT gave a better ad without even needing your browser history or data. This makes content the product again, not you. Quality publishers get rewarded while content farms and fraudulent sites are starved of revenue.\n\n\n\nThese are proof points that the economic infrastructure is being rebuilt.\n\n\n\nA turning point\n\n\n\nThe internet\u2019s promise doesn\u2019t have to die with its decline. We\u2019re at a turning point where we know AI will shape the web\u2014that\u2019s inevitable. Now we decide what kind of system we build with it.\n\n\n\nIf the attention economy monetized distraction, the agentic AI economy has the chance to monetize trust. We can use AI to filter noise instead of creating it. We can reward publications that invest in fact-checking and original reporting. We can connect ads based on values and genuine interest rather than demographic profiles. Or we can let the internet collapse\u2014either descending into unusable chaos where AI slop buries everything of value or splitting into a world where quality content exists only behind paywalls most people can\u2019t afford.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe builders who understand this moment, those championing dynamics that reward quality and trust, are ready to shape what\u2019s next. The internet we want is possible. We just have to choose to build it.",

      "content_text": "It\u2019s a sound\u2014and smell\u2014car commuters have become intimately familiar with: the noxious fumes of asphalt repaving. U.S. road maintenance and highway expansion require a massive quantity of asphalt every year, roughly 400 million tons a year on average, according to Asphalt magazine, a publication of the international trade association Asphalt Institute. But a new process developed by St. Louis-based firm Verde Resources seeks to streamline the process, making it more sustainable and odorless.\n\n\n\nVerde\u2019s new BioAsphalt process, which has been in development since 2022, utilizes what\u2019s called biochar, or natural wood remnants from forestry waste that get added into the traditional asphalt material mixture of limestone and granite aggregates. This allows the road mixture to sequester a small amount of carbon. Verde CEO Jack Wong estimates that for every 100 tons of BioAsphalt that gets laid, 10 tons of carbon dioxide gets sequestered.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re essentially creating a no-brainer model for the industry to transition to, making the product as competitive as traditional asphalt with environmental advantages and benefits,\u201d Wong says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAsphalt\u2019s environmental footprint is significant. In addition to using petroleum-based materials and requiring extensive energy for heating and installation, it also releases dangerous particulate matter as cars and trucks drive atop it. The National Asphalt Pavement Association estimated that laying down the material results in 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually in the U.S.; for comparison, that\u2019s about one-seventh the amount of emissions created by the nation\u2019s commercial airline industry.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier this summer, BioAsphalt passed the initial stages of a test at the National Center for Asphalt Technology at Auburn University in Alabama. A section of BioAsphalt roadway was tested for a year, with staff running modified 80-ton trucks across the test bed to verify its durability. The material, one of a handful trying to make asphalt less environmentally damaging,&nbsp;has been given an okay for lower-impact applications like local roads and parking lots.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve had plenty of materials and ideas come through the test track over the years, but few show the carbon reduction potential that Verde&#8217;s Biochar Asphalt does, and it&#8217;s definitely the first technology on the track with a carbon sequestration component,&#8221; said Nathan Moore, assistant director for test track research at NCAT, in a statement. While the early validation confirms its suitability for light-duty pavements, continuous evaluations are underway to determine its long-term viability for medium- to high-traffic roadways and even runways, as part of NCAT&#8217;s multiyear test cycle.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe secret to Verde\u2019s process is a proprietary emulsifying agent that blends with a liquid asphalt binder to create a specialized emulsion, bonding the biochar and aggregate.\u00a0This offers an alternative to the petroleum-based bitumen that traditionally binds roads Wong wouldn\u2019t reveal the exact additives in the firm\u2019s process, other than to say they\u2019re nonhazardous. A self-proclaimed Dune fan, he calls them \u201cspice.\u201d But they bond the roadway mixture without needing the heat required during the traditional asphalt laying process, which can hit 300 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\nThis opens up new opportunities for the road construction industry. On-site crews don\u2019t need to cart gas canisters or additional gear to heat up the asphalt, so they can travel more lightly. In addition, since heat isn\u2019t needed in the application process, they can work longer into the cold months of the year, expanding when they can repair and resurface roads and parking lots. This also means that the factories that make the asphalt mix don\u2019t need to use heat as well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWong added that while the BioAsphalt is about 15% to 20% more expensive to make, by weight, due to the different materials, it\u2019s engineered to require a thinner layer when applied. So it actually ends up being slightly cheaper when energy savings and reduced material volume are factored in.\n\n\n\nWong hopes to scale up quickly. BioAsphalt doesn\u2019t need to be heated with traditional furnaces, but it can be made in the same factory settings as traditional asphalt\u2014meaning that existing infrastructure can make the mix without needing to spend money on powering industrial furnaces. Verde is working with Ergon Asphalt &amp; Emulsions, one of the largest liquid asphalt producers in North America, on arranging distribution and licensing the proprietary process to other producers. Wong hopes to ramp up production substantially in the next year and eventually capture 10% of the market.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoadways, of course, aren\u2019t just sources of pollution themselves. But they can be considered fossil fuel infrastructure because they support the use of cars and trucks burning gasoline and diesel fuel. In response, Wong says that he feels Verde&#8217;s product offers a practical way to immediately reduce emissions that go into roadway repair and expansion.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re providing an immediate solution to the day-to-day needs for our very robust and mature road network,\u201d Wong says.&nbsp;",

      "content_text": "With more than a decade of experience working as a design and tech analyst, Andrew Hogan is all in on the efficiency and ease that tech brings to our lives. But lately at home with his daughters (ages 4 and 18 months), Hogan is grappling with something unwieldy and undefined: how parents, kids, and technology interact, from smartphones to screen time to AI.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are so eager to remove friction\u2014avoid it and smooth over the rough spots, especially as parents,\u201d Hogan says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn fall 2024, Hogan began writing a newsletter called Parent.Tech, designed to help him, and other parents, better understand how to navigate the increasingly complex world of tech and consumer products. Some of the topics covered include parenting apps, parental controls, AI\u2019s place (or not) in homework, and how to build a framework for kids\u2019 tech use.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to be a better dad, and Parent.Tech was a path to doing that,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cIt\u2019s given me some scaffolding and context to make decisions.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHogan is parenting children who are on the back end of the \u201canxious generation,\u201d named for a book written by social psychologist and New York University professor Jonathan Haidt. Touted by Oprah Winfrey and Katie Couric, the book links the steep decline in adolescent mental health to the increased reliance on screens and technology, calling this period in our culture \u201cthe great re-wiring of childhood.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaidt advocates for more time steeped in unfettered play and fewer hours tethered to tech. While Haidt\u2019s messaging isn\u2019t entirely new (documentaries Screenagers in 2016 and The Social Dilemma in 2020, and the Wait Until 8th campaign have all introduced similar conversations), it\u2019s spurred a renewed interest among parents to seek out new ways to manage tech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurs are listening. In the past decade, dozens of products have hit the market with the intention of giving kids and their families (everyone, really) the tools to reclaim attention, relationships, and presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusinesses like Yondr are making it easier for kids to go phone-free in school; startups like Tin Can ($75) are bringing back the landline; and mobile-phone makers including Light Phone ($699), Pinwheel ($119), and Gabb Wireless (phones starting at $149) are offering phones free of social media and web access. Plus, there are untold numbers of toys that promise to help children enjoy the screen-free fun they deserve. These companies have identified a real need\u2014it&#8217;s clear by now that willpower alone is not enough to keep humans off their screens. And together they are channeling our techno-anxiety into a new and growing market of products that parents are increasingly willing to shell out for.\n\n\n\nDetermining the size of this market is still tricky because the products don\u2019t fit into a neat box, despite their shared mission, says Audrey Chee-Read, principal analyst in Forrester\u2019s CMO practice. \u201cWhat you have isn\u2019t really an established category with specific guardrails [e.g., there\u2019s tech like Gabb that\u2019s considered kids consumer tech versus Yondr that\u2019s not a tech],\u201d she says. \u201cSo there is probably a forecast out there on consumer or family tech products [of which Gabb, Tin Can, and Light Phone would be under] but that will also encapsulate other things like gaming.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that these businesses are growing: From 2020 to 2023, Gabb grew 895%, nabbing a spot on the 2024 Inc. 5000 list, while Pinwheel landed in the top 5% of that same list. Jacqueline Nesi, psychologist and assistant professor at Brown University who writes a newsletter called TechnoSapiens and runs a consultancy called Tech Without Stress, says the shift is undeniable: \u201cPeople realize we can\u2019t get rid of technology so [they\u2019re asking] How do we learn to live with it in a way that promotes our well-being rather than detracts from it?\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Tin Can]\n\n\n\nBuilding protected spaces that mimic the \u201cbefore\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile most children haven\u2019t experienced life without screens, for most parents (especially Gen Xers), there\u2019s a distinct before and after. An increasing number of adults, says Chee-Read, want to tether back to a time when phones weren\u2019t in every pocket and we didn\u2019t feel the pull to check social feeds at school or work. Distraction wasn\u2019t as pervasive in our culture and there was a level of freedom to be in the moment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Graham Dugoni, grappling with the desire to spend more time in the \u201cbefore\u201d made him a founder. His company, Yondr, makes and sells lockable neoprene pouches that allow people to leave their personal tech behind at school, work, concerts, and for other experiences to remove distraction and foster connection. Dugoni refers to the Yondr mission as creating a sort of \u201cNational Park system\u201d of protected spaces.\n\n\n\n[Photo: Yondr]\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big exercise in social psychology,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happens in a phone-free space is at some level giving people a sense of freedom that they can\u2019t find in other walks of modern life. We view ourselves as part of a counterculture movement.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Yondr]\n\n\n\nInspired by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, who explored what it means to be in the world, and Marshall McLuhan, who studied the effects media has on society, Dugoni started the business in 2014, hand-making the pouches and selling them out of his Toyota RV. Since then, he\u2019s scaled Yondr to reach more than 300% year-over-year growth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDugoni hopes his product will become a form of infrastructure for a world with less screen time. The company now works with schools in 35 countries and 50 U.S. states, including one-third of all New York City secondary public schools. Los Angeles Public Schools (80% of middle schools and high schools in the district) work with the company, too, and Yondr\u2019s neoprene pouches are also used at Madison Square Garden and at comedy clubs throughout the U.S.\n\n\n\nIn fact, one of the first big relationships Dugoni secured was with comedian Dave Chappelle, who asks his audience members to store their phones in Yondr pouches during his shows to protect his act from online leaks and to maintain a distraction-free audience experience. Says Dugoni: \u201cIt\u2019s so wildly traditional, it might be revolutionary.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA big piece of being in any emerging market, he says, is buy-in and consumer education. At schools, that takes the form of writing letters to parents, holding community forums, meeting with school administration, and step-by-step, day-by-day guidance for students and adults on what a phone-free school day looks like.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWe always start with a why,\u201d says David Franklin, Yondr\u2019s manager of partner programming. \u201cWe need to change the school culture\u2014that changes attitudes and it pushes this idea forward.\u201d \n\n\n\nAt concerts and comedy clubs, Yondr employees cruise the line into the venue, talking to attendees about the pouches, how they work, and why they\u2019re a key part of that night\u2019s audience experience.&nbsp;Sometimes, Dugoni says, people resist the idea, wanting to keep their phones available. Other times, folks are happy to try the pouch for a phone-free night.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe majority of our work is around experience design,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat things have to be true for this thing to work? It&#8217;s about how you approach people and make it conducive to their understanding: \u2018This is a special experience and what you are stepping into is worth everyone being there for it.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Light Phone]\n\n\n\nSeizing gaps in the attention economy\n\n\n\nAround the same time Dugoni founded Yondr, Kaiwei Tang met his now business partner Joe Hollier at a Google incubator program in 2014. The two founded Light Phone, one of the first \u201cdumbphones\u201d on the market, a year later. The spark for Light Phone was a desire to sidestep the attention economy and a frustration with the available options. Now on its third iteration, Light Phone III (priced at $699) offers people a chance to leave the house with a way to communicate, check the weather, listen to music, or find directions, all while free of the nagging distractions that often come along with smartphones.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while Tang knew there was a market for his product, he also quickly learned there\u2019d be tension around its adoption. Change can be awkward, and as much as Light Phone built something for people who want some space from always-on tech, there would also be some friction around what using Light Phone means on a granular level.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Light Phone]\n\n\n\n\u201cWe got so much feedback from our users; when people used it, the first 15 or 20 minutes were really nerve-racking,\u201d Tang says. \u201cEveryone had this anxiety. Standing to pay for your groceries and you don\u2019t know what to do. After 15 or 20 minutes, you get over the FOMO, you remember what\u2019s happening, you pay attention to the details of the buildings or trees you never really noticed.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Light Phone]\n\n\n\nManaging that dissonance, Tang says, has been a big part of the company\u2019s growth. \u201cAsking anyone to change a longtime behavior is going to be hard,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe see it with food. We know we\u2019re eating too much grease. We can\u2019t help ourselves. We\u2019re trying to show the benefits of the organic and healthy food brands, but we\u2019re not asking everyone to become vegan. It\u2019s the same thing with Light Phone. We\u2019re trying to show the benefits of breaking away from the smartphone.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGabb Wireless is another business aiming to knock off a sliver of this market, selling Samsung phones dressed in the company\u2019s proprietary software, built specifically for kids and teens. Gabb phones and watches have no internet and no social media. Parental controls are built in, with safety and developmentally appropriate communication tools tailored for kids. Parents also have access to a Gabb app on their phones, allowing them to tap into location sharing, video calls, and text flagging capabilities on their kids\u2019 devices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Nate Randle says that while businesses in the category started when the conversation around kids and smartphones wasn\u2019t really much of a thing, the market opportunity has been clear from the start. \u201cWe talk about TAM [total addressable market],\u201d he says. \u201cThere are more than 60 million kids in the U.S. alone between the ages of 5 and 16. There is a wide-open market for an alternative solution to smartphones.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd for Gabb, showing up as a solution for families and kids has required an awareness around what it means to be a kids\u2019 tech brand. \u201cTraditionally, when someone thinks of a kids\u2019 brand, they go to rainbows and stars,\u201d says Brad Dowdle, VP of creative at Gabb Wireless. \u201cThis is Generation Alpha. They\u2019ve grown up around technology. They\u2019re savvy. It has to be aspirational, and they can\u2019t feel we\u2019re designing down to them.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen business opportunity and cultural change collide\n\n\n\nAs these solutions emerge and build a following, it\u2019s also important to zoom out on attitudes toward technology, privacy, and life online. For instance, says Chee-Read, while 63% of adults say they\u2019re concerned about online behavior being tracked, less than half of youth report feeling similarly. At the same time, grassroots organizations are pushing for legislation in California, New York, Pennsylvania, and other states to ban phones from school.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[Photo: Tin Can]\n\n\n\nA company like Tin Can, which has a mission to make the landline cool again, is showing up on national news and having a viral moment on Instagram. Jerry Chen, the founder of Firewalla, which sells cybersecurity software to homes and businesses to shield everything from baby cameras and laptops to speakers and phones, says in its first five years the business doubled in revenue annually, followed by a \u201cslowdown\u201d of 100% growth every two years. On top of all of this, of course, is a vanishing amount of institutional knowledge and understanding. As technology progresses, the number of people available to provide relevant support and advice on how to manage it\u2014especially as parents\u2014is disappearing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe factors present five years ago in terms of managing the way technology influences daily life are nearly irrelevant today. And five years from now, we\u2019ll be immersed in entirely new circumstances.\n\n\n\nFounders who can manage that kind of market speed and the dissonance around technology and its place in our lives stand to create solutions with real staying power. Entrepreneurs and CEOs like Dugoni, Randle, Tang, and Chen are selling products, yes, but they\u2019re also shaping a new version of what it means to grow up and live in our world. This is not a market built to reject tech but rather to redefine how we relate to it. And for now, Hogan\u2019s hope is that continuing to work on Parent.Tech in his off-hours will help him find the middle path in managing tech tools for himself and his kids. \u201cPeople need to design these tools, and then we need to pay for these tools,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cWe have to figure it out. No one is coming to change it for us.\u201d&nbsp;",

      "content_text": "There&#8217;s no shortage of inspiration for what to do with a part of the house that&#8217;s not quite looking its best. Interior design magazines and furniture blogs are stuffed with idealized bedrooms, and online vision boards make it easy to cast a dragnet over the myriad images of classy lounges or perfectly ordered home offices. But there&#8217;s always the unavoidable catch that while these images may be helpful references for how to rethink a room, they don&#8217;t actually represent your room.\n\n\n\nA new AI tool offers a more personalized alternative. Created by the online interior design service Havenly, it&#8217;s an app-based AI design assistant that takes user-submitted images of rooms and instantly offers modifiable design alternatives. Using AI image generation and a chatbot-based conversation about the type of design a user wants, the tool quickly pops out multiple options, with prompts to add or change things. An interactive interface allows users to swap out or even buy actual products and furnishings shown in the design concepts.\n\n\n\n[Image: Havenly]\n\n\n\n&#8220;It&#8217;s built on real design,&#8221; says Havenly CEO Lee Mayer.&nbsp;She cofounded the company in 2014, and for the past several years Havenly has been collecting its online design work in a broad database that covers more than 2 million individual design decisions and data points. Combining that with the inventories of several furnishings brands Havenly has acquired over the years, the company had the raw training materials for a large language model, the backbone of AI chatbots like ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n[Image: Havenly]\n\n\n\n&#8220;You&#8217;ve got products, you can shop those products, you can say \u2018I want to swap this product for that product\u2019 and sort of see that in the space,&#8221; Mayer says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a really great tool to play and tinker and maybe even design your home. It&#8217;s not as fully featured and fully figured as a design experience would be, but it&#8217;s quite a big step above some of the LLM models that are out there, just in terms of your ability to execute on the design.&#8221;\n\n\n\n[Image: Havenly]\n\n\n\nDesigning an AI design assistant\n\n\n\nThe tool was developed almost unintentionally. Havenly, which pairs users virtually with interior designers who offer consultations online, was having trouble keeping up with the demand for human designers. &#8220;One of the things we started to do last year was really invest in automation-based tooling for our designers themselves, largely so they could service more people as well and as effectively as they could,&#8221; Mayer says.\n\n\n\nIt was essentially a time saver that lets AI handle the top-line design questions of a project before pulling in a human design expert. As the company was developing the tool for this internal purpose, they started to play with it. &#8220;We realized it was kind of fun,&#8221; Mayer says. &#8220;Why not expose it to the consumer?&#8221;\n\n\n\n[Image: Havenly]\n\n\n\nNow available as a beta version on Havenly&#8217;s iOS app, the AI design assistant is a free way for users to start to visualize what a redesigned room could become.\n\n\n\nTesting out the tool ahead of its official launch, I asked it to offer some ideas for a few places in my own house. Not unlike my experiences with other AI chatbots that have emerged in recent years, the process was sometimes a bit clunky and confused. My first request was for ideas on filling a small space beneath a window in a children&#8217;s playroom with either storage, a bench, or a small table.\n\n\n\nApparently caught up by the part of my prompt noting that this was located in a spare bedroom, the tool generated three fully outfitted bedroom designs. When I tried to clarify, the chatbot seemed to understand what I was looking for but then gave me three more bedroom designs.\n\n\n\nSwitching to a less-specific approach, I uploaded an image of my house&#8217;s entryway and asked for suggestions on improving coat and shoe storage. The designs the tool offered were straightforward and useful, and the overall look largely matched the existing entry, albeit with much nicer furnishings. While I&#8217;m not likely to spend $600 on the small shoe shelf one design included, it did prompt some thinking about how I could more efficiently manage what can often become a jumble.\n\n\n\n[Image: Havenly]\n\n\n\nFor some users, this could easily become a gateway to buying that shoe shelf (from Havenly) or opting for a paid design service (from Havenly). It could also be a more informed way for people to rethink their space without the information overload of the internet.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Where we are in the AI wave is just understanding what people want with it and how they interact with it. I think our initial hypothesis is there is a group of people that frankly don&#8217;t need full design help,&#8221; Mayer says. &#8220;Is it perfect? No. Does it replace the designer? I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;\n\n\n\nBut it can help solve problems. Mayer says one of the beta users had more than 200 back-and-forth exchanges with the chatbot to refine ideas for upgrading a basement space.\n\n\n\nEven Mayer herself has put the tool to use, asking it to help outfit a guest bedroom on short notice. &#8220;I had guests coming within three weeks. I needed to place orders that day. I was like, all right, let&#8217;s just see what it comes up with,&#8221; she says. After a few minutes chatting with the bot, Mayer got a design that fit the room and furnishings that fit the budget. &#8220;I placed the orders,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I got the rug, the bed, and the bedding.&#8221;",

      "content_text": "A makeup illusionist, a photography project, and an innovative DJ are among the winners of Instagram\u2019s inaugural Rings awards.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe award, whose recipients were announced on Thursday, celebrates 25 creators who, in the company\u2019s words, \u201cbring people together over creativity\u201d and \u201caren\u2019t afraid to take creative chances and do it their way.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong the winners is Mimi Choi, known for turning her face into mind-bending works of art. Celebrating her win, she penned in an Instagram post: \u201cBecause of its visual nature, Instagram has really helped spread my work and jump-start my career, providing me with numerous different types of collaboration opportunities that I couldn\u2019t have even dreamed of when I began this journey.\u2063\u2063\u2063\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there&#8217;s Life on Film. Run by Grant Weintrob, Christian Baiocco, and Griffin Katz, the Instagram-first creative project hands out disposable cameras to strangers, as well as to some recognizable faces, turning their candid shots into cinematic Reels.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image: Instagram]\n\n\n\nDJ AG Online, another winner, has accrued tens of millions of views online by transforming the streets of London into spontaneous DJ sets. Self-identifying as an \u201copen format DJ,\u201d he joins the list of creatives awarded with both a physical gold ring designed by Grace Wales Bonner and a golden halo that sits around their profiles.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe full list of 2025 winners are Aki and Koichi, Ari Miller, Brian Lindo, Chris Brickley, Cole Bennett,\u00a0Ashley Gordon, Dolly Singh, Elyse Myers, Futuradosmil, Gabriel Moses, Golloria, Laufey, lifeonfilm, Linda Lomelino, Mimi Choi, Nigel Sylvester, Mika Ninagawa, Olivia Dean, Adrian Per, Sebastian Jern, Katie Krejci, Mohammed and Humaid Hadban, Thalita and Gabriela Zukeram, Tyshawn Jones, and Zarna Garg.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile many of the winners have established followings, that wasn\u2019t a factor in the judging process. Instead, each winner was honored by their peers. A panel of creatives\u2014spanning fashion and makeup to sports and entertainment\u2014each nominated their own favorite creators and voted on which 25 of Instagram\u2019s 3 billion users would be among the first to receive the honor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image: Instagram]\n\n\n\nThe panel of judges included fashion and jewelry designer Grace Wales Bonner, who designed the gold ring each winner will receive; movie director Spike Lee; fashion designer Marc Jacobs; artist Kaws; makeup artist Pat McGrath; influencer Marques Brownlee, aka MKBHD; actress Yara Shahidi; pastry chef C\u00e9dric Grolet; Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher; music producer and songwriter Tainy; photographer Murad Osmann; Instagram exec and fashion journalist Eva Chen; and head of Intagram Adam Mosseri.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThis award is for the creators who don\u2019t just participate in culture\u2014but shift it, break through whatever barrier holds them back to realize their ambitions.

      "content_text": "When companies undergo a major change, such as a CEO transition, reorganization, merger, or acquisition, most leaders default to one well-worn instinct: control the message. Lock down talking points. Tighten the language. Make it polished and official.\n\n\n\nIn working with executive teams across industries, from tech to retail, we\u2019ve seen time and again that simply trying to control the message isn\u2019t enough. In fact, it often has the opposite effect, creating more confusion and mistrust than clarity.\n\n\n\nBecause in every high-stakes moment, your audience\u2014employees, customers, investors\u2014is asking the same unspoken question: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not answering it, someone else will.\n\n\n\nWhy WIIFM isn\u2019t a selfish question\n\n\n\nFor years, the phrase \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d (or WIIFM) has gotten a bad rap. Leaders dismiss it as self-centered or marketing fluff. Not a serious strategy.\n\n\n\nBut the opposite is true: WIIFM is one of the most powerful lenses available to a leader navigating complex change. It\u2019s not about pandering. It\u2019s about making strategy&nbsp;personal&nbsp;and&nbsp;anticipating needs. When people understand how a change will impact&nbsp;them, they\u2019re far more likely to align with it, advocate for it, and stick around to help execute it.\n\n\n\nWIIFM isn\u2019t about promising perks or pay raises. It\u2019s about translating organizational ambition into something timely and tangible for the people you need on board.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this across the board: in mergers and acquisitions where alignment felt impossible, in CEO transitions where trust was on the line, and in executive team restructurings where internal politics threatened progress. Leaders who start with WIIFM consistently build momentum, while those who skip it often lose the narrative . . . and the talent.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when leaders skip the WIIFM moment\n\n\n\nNot long ago, we worked with a company making an acquisition. The executive team was excited about the deal and confident about the shared mission, but in those critical first weeks after the announcement, they froze. Without all the answers in place, they waited to finalize every detail before they communicated anything\u00a0to the acquired organization.\n\n\n\nDuring that time, the acquired organization was left to speculate. Rumors flew. Teams filled in the blanks. Fear took over. By the time the executive team had the certainty the acquired company was looking for and formal messaging landed, it was too late.&nbsp; Some talent had moved on, and for the rest, they were left with months of unwinding the rumors and working from a deficit to rebuild trust.\n\n\n\nWe see this pattern again and again: silence creates space for confusion. In the absence of clarity, people default to self-protection and assume the worst. The longer the silence lingers, the further they go down the rabbit hole.\n\n\n\nBut when leaders show up early, even if all the answers aren\u2019t yet clear, and acknowledge the WIIFM questions head-on, they build trust. As one client told us, \u201cWhen you show your face, you get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d By anticipating their needs, you can limit their anxieties and show that you considered how they may be impacted.\n\n\n\nHow to answer \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d (without saying those exact words)\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: this isn\u2019t about scripting new taglines. It\u2019s about pausing to ask a better question before you write the message. Before announcing any change, take five minutes to ask:\n\n\n\n\nWhat might my audience be worried about right now?\n\n\n\nWhat might they hope this change will solve for them?\n\n\n\nWhat could this feel like from their seat?\n\n\n\n\nAs one senior leader we worked with put it:&nbsp; \u201cPeople don&#8217;t expect their leaders to have all the answers\u2014they expect presence. Leaders must be transparent, empathetic, and engaged in navigating change alongside their teams.&#8221;\n\n\n\nOne message, many audiences: How to stay consistent\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest hesitations we hear from executives is:&nbsp;How do I tailor the message without creating inconsistencies?\n\n\n\nThe answer is to identify a core message and then deliver it in audience-relevant language. Your strategy may not change, but the way you communicate it will. For example, your core message might be: \u201cWe\u2019re evolving our structure to accelerate innovation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFor employees, that might sound like: \u201cWe\u2019re investing in clearer roles and fewer bottlenecks so teams can move faster and focus more on the work that matters.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor customers: \u201cThis means quicker product releases, better service, and less lag time.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor investors: \u201cWe expect this change to improve speed-to-market and reduce operating inefficiencies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEach message serves the same strategy. But each audience hears what matters most&nbsp;to them.&nbsp;Four prompts to make it personal\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve developed four simple prompts that help leaders shift their communication from top-down announcements to audience-centered leadership:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are they worried about losing?\u201dSecurity? Status? Control? Address it head-on.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat might they gain?\u201dNew opportunities, visibility, development, autonomy\u2014spell it out. But don\u2019t make any promises.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat does this mean for them in the next 30, 60, 90 days?\u201dUse time as a grounding tool and a project management asset. This may present an opportunity to reengage with the audience after each benchmark.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat will we be transparent about even if we don\u2019t have all the answers yet?\u201dUncertainty is okay. Silence is not.\n\n\n\n\nThese prompts do more than clarify the messaging. They help you show up as a leader who gets it and who doesn\u2019t just recite vision statements but connects them to the lived realities.\n\n\n\nLeading in the uncertainty gap\n\n\n\nAs leaders, we often feel the pressure to have everything figured out before we speak up. But that instinct is counterproductive.\n\n\n\nWaiting for perfect information, especially in M&amp;A scenarios, means you\u2019ve already lost the room. As ProjectNext senior advisor Connie Rawson often reminds our clients, \u201cEven saying, \u2018We don\u2019t have all the answers yet, but here\u2019s what you can expect in the next 30 days,\u2019 creates more stability than radio silence.\u201d\n\n\n\nBecause the real risk isn\u2019t in saying the wrong thing, it\u2019s in saying nothing at all. In an era where trust is harder to earn and easier to lose, hierarchical authority doesn\u2019t command unbridled loyalty the way it used to. People want clarity, connection, and honesty. They deserve it.\n\n\n\nThe good news? WIIFM isn\u2019t just a tool for crisis moments. It\u2019s a muscle you can build into your everyday leadership. When you consistently make strategy personal across teams, stakeholders, and situations, you don\u2019t just manage change. You lead through it.",

      "content_text": "A typical three-bedroom house in Austin, Texas, can sometimes rack up monthly utility bills of $200 or $300 in the summer. But in new homes under construction in a nearby suburb, residents will owe little beyond the basic utility connection fee.\n\n\n\nThe homes, built by Habitat for Humanity, tap into a shared geothermal system in a fully geothermal neighborhood. Heat pumps in each house connect to pipes that loop hundreds of feet underground, making use of the earth\u2019s steady temperature for heating and cooling. The houses are also built to use as little energy as possible, with features like deep eaves that shade the interior and reduce the need for air-conditioning. Solar shingles on the roofs produce enough power to match each home\u2019s expected electricity use.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make sure that they have a very, very low energy bill at the end of the day,\u201d says Billy Whipple, chief impact officer at Habitat for Humanity&#8217;s Austin office.\n\n\n\nThe nonprofit, known for working with volunteers to help lower the cost of construction, sees affordable housing holistically. It\u2019s not enough just to have a low monthly mortgage payment; homes also need to be designed to have low maintenance and utility costs, especially as energy bills keep rising.\n\n\n\n[Rendering: courtesy Austin Habitat for Humanity]\n\n\n\nA 100% geothermal neighborhood\n\n\n\nThe houses are part of Whisper Valley, a larger development that was designed to rely on geothermal energy. This type of geothermal technology, also known as a ground-source heat pump, isn&#8217;t new. Habitat for Humanity has used the tech itself in other developments. But it&#8217;s still fairly uncommon because of the cost. Depending on the house, some systems can cost as much as $45,000. Building a connected network for the neighborhood, rather than adding the technology home by home, helps make it more affordable.\n\n\n\nEcoSmart Solution, a company that builds geothermal infrastructure, drills boreholes on each lot that connect to a larger energy system. &#8220;It allows us to implement the geothermal heating and cooling system at a fraction of the cost of doing it on a home-by-home basis,&#8221; says Chris Gray, EcoSmart&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;We bring it as a service. We do all of the drilling, all of the piping, all of the network connecting to each lot before the builders ever take over the lot.&#8221;\n\n\n\nTaurus Investment Holdings, the original developer behind the property, had a vision of making sustainability mainstream. &#8220;They were looking at what we can do to really create sustainability, but in an accessible, affordable way that can be approachable for the mass market,&#8221; Gray says.\n\n\n\n[Photo: EcoSmart Solution]\n\n\n\nThe first homes began construction in 2017, and hundreds are now in place. Ultimately, the neighborhood is projected to have around 7,500 homes built by a variety of developers, along with businesses and around 700 acres of green space. Houses currently listed for sale range up to $465,000. Habitat for Humanity&#8217;s three-bedroom and four-bedroom homes, available for families earning 60% to 80% of the area median income, are much more affordable, at $230,000 to $245,000. (That&#8217;s also well below the average cost within the city of Austin, where the median sales price was around $575,000 last month.)\n\n\n\nThe nonprofit budgeted around $33,000 per house to add the solar and geothermal systems, according to Whipple. \n\n\n\nUltra-efficient homes\n\n\n\nTo minimize energy use, Habitat&#8217;s homes are well-insulated with an extra-tight building envelope. &#8220;When [homeowners] heat and cool, they won&#8217;t have to do it as frequently,&#8221; Whipple says. The houses also use passive design techniques, like deep overhangs on the windows that provide shade on sweltering Texas days.\n\n\n\nInside, the appliances are Energy Star certified. The homes also use LED lighting, smart thermostats, and heat pump water heaters. While it&#8217;s impossible to predict how much energy a particular family might use\u2014if they like to crank up the AC especially high, for example\u2014the size of the solar system installed on the roof was calculated to cover all typical usage.\n\n\n\nThat obviously makes a difference for residents on tight budgets. Skyler Korgel, one future resident who will be a first-time homeowner, says that he currently pays between $35 and $70 a month on energy bills in his apartment. &#8220;Having that jump to $200 to $300 per month, or unpredictably more during the summers, in a traditional home would be financially unsustainable for me,&#8221; Korgel says.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Between the geothermal heating system, rooftop solar panels, smart energy management systems, high-efficiency appliances, and a tight building envelope, I am hopeful that I can reach energy usage of effectively zero, eliminate my energy bill for some months, and\u00a0even be able to provide power when the electric grid is strained,&#8221; he says.\n\n\n\nA model for future development\n\n\n\nHabitat for Humanity is building 48 homes in the neighborhood, including 25 that will be constructed in October by volunteers in a five-day sprint. (Skilled construction workers are handling more complex tasks like connecting heat pumps to the geothermal system.) But it&#8217;s also considering using the solar-and-networked geothermal approach for future homes. That may include more houses at Whisper Valley.\n\n\n\nEcoSmart is working with other developers to plan new projects across the country, from single-family homes to multifamily buildings. Others are also turning to geothermal. In Brooklyn, for example, a 463-unit apartment building that recently opened uses hundreds of geothermal wells for heating and cooling. An even larger all-geothermal apartment complex is opening in another part of Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, existing neighborhoods are also moving to geothermal. Near Boston, one neighborhood has been testing a shift from gas heat to geothermal heating and cooling over the last two years. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, the city is building a geothermal district system in a neighborhood where 75% of residents are low-income\u2014both as part of the city&#8217;s work to reach climate goals and to help residents significantly cut energy bills.",

      "content_text": "The most common email messages I receive these days are obviously AI-generated pitches for guests to appear on my podcast. They all begin the same way, with a praising reference to one of my recent episodes\u2014usually the second-to-last posted show. \u201cYour recent interview with so-and-so was penetrating, and got to the heart of the problem of x or y.\u201d Then comes the crucial pivot: \u201cJohn Dough\u2019s work takes that problem even further . . .\u201d And then the pitch for John Dough to be on the podcast.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe problem is not just that the publicist used AI to shotgun the known universe of podcasters with pitches artificially customized to their shows. It\u2019s that the comparisons and connections are really bad. \u201cYour guest spoke so passionately about being a death doula, I think you would be so interested in an artist who makes Halloween napkins festooned with skeletons, which are usually of dead people.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo what do I do? I blacklist the sender. The human publicist ends up losing credibility because the one thing I might trust her to do\u2014to accurately assess the appropriateness of my show for her guest\u2014had been surrendered to a machine whose job was to make that connection by any means necessary.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was using AI in the fashion of an Industrial Age factory owner to increase her productivity, but simultaneously ignoring the human process that defines her expertise.\n\n\n\nI see the same thing happen with AI-generated reports and presentations. Someone gets some speculative idea and then asks Chat to justify it with a few case studies. On the surface, the case studies may sound like they\u2019re supporting the premise\u2014but if you look any deeper, they don\u2019t really relate at all. They\u2019re analogous, but not truly relevant. Worse yet, they\u2019re sitting in what looks like a fully realized Powerpoint presentation. Concepts that could have been interpreted as half-baked, speculative, or open to discussion now appear finalized. They seem inappropriately unrealized for how elaborately they have been rendered, and make the presenter seem foolish. (That is, if the recipient is even reading the work rather than having their AI summarize it.)\n\n\n\nDeskilling ourselves\n\n\n\nBy using the AI to do the big stuff\u2014by outsourcing our primary competencies to the machines instead of giving them the boring busywork\u2014we deskill ourselves and deprive everyone of the opportunity for AI-enhanced outputs. Too many of us are using AI as the primary architect for a project, rather than the general contractor who supports the architect\u2019s human vision. (And even many of the general contractor\u2019s functions are attributable to the human relationships they have developed over the years.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeople are treating their chats as if they were fully realized (but as yet nonexistent) AGIs, and letting them do big stuff rather than treating them like tools that can do lots of little stuff. When facing a new seemingly gargantuan project, they turn to the AI first rather than digging in and doing some research\u2014perhaps even using the AI as a research tool instead of relegating the whole project to it all at once. The output looks good to the user, less because it is good than because the Chat has been programmed to make the user feel good about their query. \u201cThat\u2019s an insightful project idea, Douglas! I\u2019ve managed to flesh out an entire proposal at three different price points.\u201d The positive feedback loop reinforces the user behavior, until the threshold for asking the Chat to do the project is lower and lower. In the name of getting more product out there, the user loses touch with their own process\u2014their core competency.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNo shortcuts\n\n\n\nThe only ones who win in such a scenario are the AI companies, who effectively commoditize the users and their companies. Without any core competencies, the only competitive advantage a user has left is the robustness of their service contract with the AI company. The fast, slapdash results are not worth the cost in human expertise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the researcher behind MIT\u2019s study \u201cThis is Your Brain on ChatGPT\u201d explained at a recent ANDUS event, when people turn to an AI for a solution before working on a problem themselves, the number of connections formed in their brains decreases. But when they turn to the AI after working on the problem for a while, they end up with more neural connections than if they worked entirely alone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because the value of the AI is not its ability to create product for us, but to engage with us in our process. Working and iterating with an AI\u2014doing what we could call generative thinking\u2014is actually a break from Industrial Age thinking. We focus less on outputs than on cycles. Less on the volume of short-term results (assembly line), and more on the quality and complexity of thought and innovation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAI\u2019s don\u2019t have to replace our competencies or even our employees. That\u2019s less an opportunity for success and scale than it is a recipe for deskilling, commodification, and eventual disappearance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdopting AI as a partner in process and enhancer of competencies requires developing a new kind of culture around technology and innovation\u2014one that centers the human ingenuity at the core of a company, and supports the ways that new, intelligent technologies can foster that living resource.",

Then, distraction hits, and you forget entirely what prompted you.\n\n\n\nOr else, you search the house for your car keys or your glasses, or your wallet. A good 10 minutes later, you realize they\u2019ve been with you the whole time.\n\n\n\nYou sit down to write an article about an intriguing study having to do with memory\u2014if only you could remember what it was.\n\n\n\n\nYes, these are highly personal anecdotes. But like all the best stories, I hope they\u2019re simply the unique expression of universal truths.\n\n\n\nPerhaps second only to the fear of death itself, the one thing I\u2019ve heard business leaders admit that they fear most is the idea of losing their memory.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve latched on with gusto to a recent study out of Harvard University, among other institutions, that suggests a simple, straightforward way to improve cognitive health.\n\n\n\nA Mediterranean-style diet\n\n\n\nWriting in the journal&nbsp;Nature Medicine, researchers from Mass General Brigham, the Broad Institute of MIT, and yes, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, say that making a simple dietary change can \u201cinfluence key metabolic pathways that protect memory and cognitive function.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe strategy: Make a conscious change to switch to a Mediterranean-style diet.\n\n\n\nMore on the nose, according to a&nbsp;summary:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re not the first to tout the benefits of this diet; heck, I\u2019ve written about other studies here before.\n\n\n\nBut this team analyzed data from two studies, including a total of 5,705 men and women from two longitudinal studies: the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, followed by the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.\n\n\n\nAnd, by studying three factors: \u201clong-term dietary patterns,\u201d \u201cparticipant\u2019s inherited risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d and the incidence of \u201cnew cases of dementia,\u201d they were able to make some striking conclusions.\n\n\n\n\u2018Help reduce the risk\u2019\n\n\n\nAccording to the study\u2019s first author, Yuxi Liu, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBefore I forget (ironic, right?) we should ensure that we\u2019ve established what a Mediterranean-style diet actually entails. It includes a few factors:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the primary fat source is olive oil, as opposed to higher saturated fats that are sometimes seen in Western diets.\n\n\n\nSecond, whole grains. Lots of them. Plus, vegetables and fruits\u2014probably four servings per day.\n\n\n\nThird, lean proteins. Think fish, chicken, turkey, and eggs.\n\n\n\nFourth: Very limited red meat intake.\n\n\n\nFinally, lots of fiber from a variety of plant sources.\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite kind of study\n\n\n\nHonestly, this makes it fall into the category of \u201cfrankly quite pleasurable things I might do anyway, even without the study.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich therefore makes it my favorite kind of study.\n\n\n\nShort version? Do something I\u2019d normally do almost without prompting, and get an unexpected benefit?

And also, there are very valid reasons to take low-paying work, if it can help launch your business.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can open the right doors without selling yourself short.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is good for your portfolio\n\n\n\nPotential clients will expect \u201cproof\u201d that your work is good\u2014especially if it\u2019s the type of work that can be displayed in a portfolio (design, video, writing, or other creative work). Portfolios don\u2019t grow overnight. One good client at a lower rate will lead to a better client who pays more.\n\n\n\nEven now, several years into freelance writing, I\u2019ll still take projects below my normal rate if I think the work will be a standout in my portfolio. The payoff comes when clients approach me and say, \u201cI saw your work for XYZ company\u2014I love that publication!\u201d\n\n\n\nSometimes projects can earn you far more in the long run than your short-term payout.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe project will connect you with important people\n\n\n\nSome of my best clients are referrals, even when the original project was low-paying, boring, or short-term. I\u2019ve even had clients rehire me when they move on to their next gig.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll quickly learn which people in your industry are \u201cmovers and shakers.\u201d By working with them, you could get a glowing recommendation or countless referrals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can also say yes to speaking on panels, podcast appearances, and writing guest posts for publications if you feel like the work will get you in front of the right audience or make good industry connections. These are often a much lower lift than a full-blown paid project and can have a similar impact.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can learn new skills\n\n\n\nIf you need it, here\u2019s your permission to say \u201cyes\u201d to a project that\u2019s slightly outside of your skill set. Slightly being the operative word. You need to be confident that you can meet the client\u2019s expectations. But it\u2019s also an opportunity to try something new and get paid for the work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t ever, ever overpromise and under-deliver. However, sometimes the only way to gain new skills as a solo business owner is to take on the work, wow the client, and get the project into your portfolio so you can take on future projects that require the same skill set.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s OK to say \u201cno\u201d\n\n\n\nFor many self-employed people, money is a primary factor in accepting projects. But just like there are valid reasons beyond money to take on new work, there are also valid reasons for declining work\u2014even if the money is good.\n\n\n\nBad clients can cost you. They can absorb too much of your time and mental energy. You may also reach a point in your business where you don\u2019t need the money, even if you have the bandwidth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about running your own business is that you get to make those decisions. When you work for an employer, you\u2019re forced onto projects or stuck with colleagues you\u2019d rather avoid. Self-employment is different. Taking on clients is a business decision\u2014and you should get comfortable basing your decisions on factors other than money.",

      "content_text": "\u201cLet\u2019s circle back when we have the bandwidth to touch base on whether we need to hop on a call to tackle the low-hanging fruit.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\n(If this corporate buzzword bingo sent a shiver down your spine\u2014apologies.)\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the world of professional communication, business jargon is often a necessary evil. Email clich\u00e9s: love \u2018em or hate \u2018em, we all use \u2018em.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany of us are trapped in a terminal cycle of \u201creaching out\u201d and \u201ccircling back\u201d to make sure \u201cwe\u2019re aligned.\u201d Recent analysis from email verification company ZeroBounce looked at more than one million real work emails to find out which overused email phrases are the most common offenders.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo no one&#8217;s surprise, \u201creaching out\u201d is the reigning champ with 6,117 appearances, shortly followed by follow-ups of all kinds (\u201cto follow up,\u201d \u201cfollowing up,\u201d \u201cwill follow up\u201d) with 5,755 mentions.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNearly 3,000 emails also started with a version of \u201chope\u201d: \u201cHope you\u2019re doing well,\u201d \u201cHope this finds you well,\u201d or \u201cHope all is well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther honorable mentions include \u201cHappy Friday\u201d (as well as the slightly less popular \u201cHappy Monday\u201d). \u201cTouch base,\u201d \u201chop on a call,\u201d \u201cbandwidth,\u201d and \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d were commonly identified by researchers..&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cLanguage habits are some of the hardest to change,\u201d Liviu Tanase, founder and CEO of ZeroBounce, told Fast Company. Despite nearly one in four employees now using AI to help write emails, the language hasn\u2019t moved with the times.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven with smart AI tools embedded in our inboxes, people still fall back on familiar phrases because they feel safe and sometimes, we don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe added: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time we all \u2018circle back\u2019 to sounding human again.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere, Gen Z is leading the charge. Young workers have no qualms including memes, emojis, slang, and abbreviations in their emails\u2014just as they would text in a group chat with friends.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAround 71% of people surveyed by the U.K. bank Barclays in 2023 said they believed Gen Z was changing the formality of language in the workplace. What worked in formal business correspondence just a decade or two ago, can be received as cold or even rude among today\u2019s digital natives.\n\n\n\nFor those looking to refresh their email etiquette, ZeroBounce offered a few easy swaps to test out in your next correspondence.\n\n\n\nRather than penning \u201chope this finds you well,\u201d you could ask, \u201chow&#8217;s your week going?\u201d Or open with, \u201cGood morning \u2013 quick one.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ubiquitous \u201cjust checking in\u201d or \u201cfollowing up\u201d can be replaced with something more direct: \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the proposal?\u201d (Many of us default to using \u201csofter\u201d language to our detriment, anyway.)\n\n\n\nFor those looking to shake things further and take a leaf out of Gen Z\u2019s playbook, one TikTok creator offered some suggestions to inject more mystery or foreboding in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope this email finds you,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThis kind of implies that everyone thinks you\u2019re missing and they don\u2019t know where you are. This is something really good to send to your remote coworkers.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: use at your own risk. But if you want to use a safer work email clich\u00e9, you can always just ask them to ping you.",

      "content_text": "Every year, Audience Audit publishes a study on what agency clients really want\u2014and the 2025 edition revealed a stat that should stop any agency leader in their tracks: 77% of clients say they\u2019re more likely to hire an agency that\u2019s a recognized AI expert (not just self-proclaimed). But only 32% believe their current agency fits that description.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s more telling: When asked what they expect from their agency when it comes to AI, clients didn\u2019t say \u201cefficiency\u201d or \u201ccheaper deliverables.\u201d They want new ideas, sharper analysis, and real guidance on how to use AI themselves. In other words, they\u2019re not just looking for agencies that use AI. They want partners who know how to think with it.\n\n\n\nAt Quantious, being \u201cAI-fluent\u201d isn\u2019t a role, it\u2019s a team standard. Every producer, strategist, and designer is expected to not just keep up, but lead. And we don\u2019t just talk about it in pitches, we practice it every day.\n\n\n\nWant to build real AI fluency across your team? Here are five ways we\u2019ve made it part of our everyday work.\n\n\n\n1. Invest in professional development like it\u2019s our job (because it is)\n\n\n\nProfessional development isn\u2019t a once-a-year checkbox here, it\u2019s a cultural value. We budget for AI courses, certification programs, and conferences because we believe time spent learning is time well spent. We\u2019ve encouraged team members to tackle everything from AI marketing bootcamps to building apps with vibe-coding tools like Replit, Lovable, Replay.io, or Base44 (Seriously, one project lead with no coding background just built his own app!).\n\n\n\nWe believe in fostering a culture of experimentation, and to some, our approach looks a little risky. When we invest in our team members\u2019 professional development, we know it\u2019s not always going to instantly translate to value for our clients. But guess what? Innovation stems from learning and exploring, and that\u2019s exactly how our teams end up ahead of the trends, every time.\n\n\n\n2. Host team-led AI workshops\n\n\n\nOur favorite AI tipsters are each other. When a team member cracks a new use case\u2014like building out a personalized GPT, or using AI to develop complex Excel formulas\u2014they host internal workshops to share what they\u2019ve learned. We\u2019ve had workshops on everything from AI product image generation to deepfake identification. We document our processes, record quick tutorials of what we\u2019ve learned, and aim to keep knowledge moving fast.\n\n\n\n3. Encourage experimentation on live work\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t treat AI like a lab project. We build with it every day. Designers test layout variations with image generation tools. Marketing producers use AI to pull research for brand sentiment audits or to map out user journeys. Copywriters turn notes into outlines, organizing their thoughts before drafting. We\u2019ve learned how to craft meaningful prompts, how to develop our own agents, and how to build out some seriously complex spreadsheet formulas using AI. We automate time-consuming processes, using Bluedot, Slack, and Limitless to transcribe company meeting notes in real time. We use these tools with our brains, not instead of them.\n\n\n\nIn every aspect of our work, we remember that AI is a collaborator, not a replacement for hard work and creativity. Say it with me: You cannot just check out and have AI do it all for you. (Just ask Randy Marsh of South Park; it doesn\u2019t end well!)\n\n\n\n4. Treat AI safety and usage guidelines as a living document\n\n\n\nAI is moving fast, and so are the conversations around safety, security, and ethical use. That\u2019s exactly why we treat our AI guidelines as a work in progress, instead of a static rulebook. Leadership actively invites input from across our team to flag new risks, suggest safeguards, and share best practices.\n\n\n\nAI responsibility is a shared approach we take, and we want to ensure everyone has a role to play in mitigating data privacy and bias. This has led us to embrace a smarter, safer, and more thoughtful AI practice that evolves along with the tech.\n\n\n\n5. Help clients navigate the AI maze\n\n\n\nAI tools are evolving daily\u2014and most of our clients are trying to make sense of what\u2019s worth their time, what\u2019s secure, and what actually works. The real value lies in making AI feel less overwhelming, and more actionable.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s vital to not just use AI to drive internal efficiencies, but to help clients make it work for them in their own workflows. Whether it\u2019s creating custom GPTs, mapping out automated content workflows, or guiding teams through prompt strategy, we treat AI as a collaborative layer in the client relationship.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re transparent about it. When AI plays a role in our work, we explain how, why, and what it means for the outcomes. That clarity builds trust and helps future-proof our clients\u2019 teams.\n\n\n\nOur job isn\u2019t just to use AI\u2014it\u2019s to help our clients understand it, apply it responsibly, and stay ahead of the curve. That\u2019s where the real value is.\n\n\n\nThe future of creative work isn\u2019t going to be driven by opening up a browser tab and launching ChatGPT. It\u2019s going to be driven by humans who can automate a tedious quality assurance process, use AI to spot brand inconsistencies across campaigns, or extract insights from raw customer feedback, safely. Because knowing when not to use AI is just as important as knowing how.\n\n\n\nLisa Larson-Kelley is founder and CEO of Quantious.",
