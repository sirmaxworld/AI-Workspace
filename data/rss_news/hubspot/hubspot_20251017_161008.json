      "content_text": "TL;DR: Enterprise generative AI tools are advanced software platforms designed to automate and enhance marketing, sales, and customer service at scale.  \n The best tools integrate with your CRM, unify customer data, and support secure, governed workflows.  \n To choose the right solution, focus on proven use cases, integration depth, governance controls, and measurable ROI. Start with a clear rollout plan, align teams, and use a selection matrix to compare vendors. \n  \nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT have changed individual work, but using them in a company causes many challenges. Teams copy-paste customer data into external interfaces, but the outputs lack context from your CRM, and there's no audit trail when something goes wrong. Security teams raise red flags, compliance officers demand answers, and leadership questions whether the technology is ready for production use.",
