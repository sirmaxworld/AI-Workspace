      "content_text": "A paper-thin device uses quantum dots, similar to those described in this work, to light up LEDs. Credit: Lin Zhou, Xianghua Wang Light bulbs come in all sorts of forms\u2014globes, spirals, candle-like tips, and long tubes\u2014but few are truly thin. Now, scientists reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have designed an LED so slender it\u2019s nearly as thin as paper, yet it emits a cozy, sunlike glow. This new design could illuminate the future of phone and computer screens as well as other lighting applications, all while minimizing sleep disruption caused by harsh artificial light. \"This work demonstrates the feasibility of ultra-thin, large-area quantum dot LEDs that closely match the solar spectrum,\" says Xianghua Wang, a corresponding author of the study. \"These devices could enable next-generation eye-friendly displays, adaptive indoor lighting, and even wavelength-tunable sources for horticulture or well-being applications.\" Many people prefer indoor lighting that feels natural and soothing. Earlier approaches achieved this effect with flexible LEDs that used red and yellow phosphorescent dyes to create a candle-like warmth. A newer alternative relies on quantum dots\u2014tiny semiconductor particles that transform electrical energy into colored light. Some research teams have already used quantum dots to make white LEDs, but replicating the complete spectrum of sunlight has remained difficult, particularly in the yellow and green regions where sunlight is strongest. To address this challenge, Lei Chen and colleagues developed quantum dots that could recreate that balanced, sunlike glow in a thin, white quantum dot LED (QLED). Meanwhile, Wang\u2019s group proposed an efficient conductive material design that could operate effectively at relatively low voltages. The team began by synthesizing red, yellow-green, and blue quantum dots coated with zinc-sulfur shells. They determined the precise color ratio needed to match the spectrum of natural sunlight as closely as possible. Next, they assembled the QLED on an indium tin oxide glass substrate, layering conductive polymers, the quantum dot blend, metal oxide particles, and finally a top coating of aluminum or silver. The quantum dot layer measured only a few dozen nanometers in thickness\u2014much thinner than standard color conversion layers\u2014resulting in a white QLED with an overall profile comparable to wallpaper. In initial tests, the thin QLED performed best under a 11.5-volt (V) power supply, giving off the maxmium bright, warm white light. The emitted light had more intensity in red wavelengths and less intensity in blue wavelengths, which is better for sleep and eye health, according to the researchers. Objects illuminated by the QLED should appear close to their true colors, scoring over 92% on the color rendering index. In further experiments, the researchers made 26 white QLED devices, using the same quantum dots but different electrically conductive materials to optimize the operating voltage. These light sources required only 8 V to reach maximum light output, and about 80% exceeded the target brightness for computer monitors.

      "content_text": "Permanent nanoscale loop electrical currents in kagome metals. Credit: Kano Okada, Nagoya University Quantum metals are a special class of materials in which quantum effects, usually only noticeable at the atomic level, become strong enough to influence the material\u2019s large-scale electrical behavior. A research team in Japan has now clarified how electricity behaves in one particular family of these materials known as kagome metals. In their study, they showed for the first time that weak magnetic fields can flip tiny circulating electrical currents within the metal. This reversal alters how easily electricity moves in different directions, creating what is known as the diode effect, where current flows more readily one way than the other. The team also discovered that quantum geometric effects magnify this electrical switching by about 100 times. Their work, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , lays the theoretical groundwork for future electronic technologies that could be controlled with simple magnets. Since about 2020, scientists have observed this unusual magnetic switching in experiments but were unable to explain what caused it or why the effect was so pronounced. The new study provides the first complete theoretical explanation for both. When frustrated electrons cannot settle The name \"kagome metal\" comes from the Japanese word \"kagome,\" meaning \"basket eyes\" or \"basket pattern,\" a reference to a traditional bamboo weaving style that forms interlocking triangles. In these metals, atoms are arranged in the same distinctive geometric pattern. This structure leads to what physicists call \"geometric frustration\"\u2014a situation where electrons cannot form neat, orderly arrangements. Instead, they settle into complex quantum states that include the circulating loop currents observed in the experiments. When the direction of these loop currents changes, so does the way the metal conducts electricity. The researchers found that the loop currents interact with wave-like electron arrangements (charge density waves), breaking key symmetries in the material\u2019s electronic structure. They further determined that quantum geometric effects\u2014behaviors that emerge only at the smallest scales of matter\u2014greatly amplify the switching response. \"Every time we saw the magnetic switching, we knew something extraordinary was happening, but we couldn't explain why,\" Hiroshi Kontani, senior author and professor from the Graduate School of Science at Nagoya University, recalled. \"Kagome metals have built-in amplifiers that make the quantum effects much stronger than they would be in ordinary metals. The combination of their crystal structure and electronic behavior allows them to break certain core rules of physics simultaneously, a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is extremely rare in nature and explains why the effect is so powerful.\" To conduct their experiments, the scientists cooled the metals to about -190\u00b0C. At this extremely low temperature, kagome metals naturally form quantum states in which electrons move in circular paths and generate wave-like patterns across the material. When weak magnetic fields are applied, the direction of these circulating currents flips, which in turn reverses the preferred direction of electrical flow. New materials meet new theory This breakthrough in quantum physics was not possible until recently because kagome metals were only discovered around 2020. While scientists quickly observed the mysterious electrical switching effect in experiments, they could not explain how it worked. The quantum interactions involved are very complex and require advanced understanding of how loop currents, quantum geometry, and magnetic fields work together -- knowledge that has only developed in recent years. These effects are also very sensitive to impurities, strain, and external conditions, which makes them difficult to study. \"This discovery happened because three things came together at just the right time: we finally had the new materials, the advanced theories to understand them, and the high-tech equipment to study them properly. None of these existed together until very recently, which is why no one could solve this puzzle before now,\" Professor Kontani added. \"The magnetic control of electrical properties in these metals could potentially enable new types of magnetic memory devices or ultra-sensitive sensors. Our study provides the fundamental understanding needed to begin developing the next generation of quantum-controlled technology,\" he said.",

      "content_text": "Scientists have finally proven that large quantum systems truly follow the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics. Credit: Shutterstock Can you prove whether a large quantum system truly behaves according to the weird and wonderful rules of quantum mechanics -- or if it just looks like it does? In a groundbreaking study, physicists from Leiden, Beijing en Hangzhou found the answer to this question. You could call it a 'quantum lie detector': Bell's test designed by famous physicist John Bell. This test shows whether a machine, like a quantum computer, is truly using quantum effects or just mimics them. As quantum technologies become more mature, ever more stringent tests of quantumness become necessary. In this new study, the researchers took things to the next level, testing Bell correlations in systems with up to 73 qubits -- the basic building blocks of a quantum computer. The study involved a global team: theoretical physicists Jordi Tura, Patrick Emonts, PhD candidate Mengyao Hu from Leiden University, together with colleagues from Tsinghua University (Beijing) and experimental physicists from Zhejiang University (Hangzhou). The world of quantum physics Quantum mechanics is the science that explains how the tiniest particles in the universe -- like atoms and electrons -- behave. It's a world full of strange and counterintuitive ideas. One of those is quantum nonlocality, where particles appear to instantly affect each other, even when far apart. Although it sounds strange, it's a real effect, and it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022. This research is focused on proving the occurrence of nonlocal correlation, also known as Bell correlations. Clever experimenting It was an extremely ambitious plan, but the team's well-optimized strategy made all the difference. Instead of trying to directly measure the complex Bell correlations, they focused on something quantum devices are already good at: minimizing energy. And it paid off. The team created a special quantum state using 73 qubits in a superconducting quantum processor and measured energies far below what would be possible in a classical system. The difference was striking -- 48 standard deviations -- making it almost impossible that the result was due to chance. But the team didn't stop there. They went on to certify a rare and more demanding type of nonlocality - known as genuine multipartite Bell correlations. In this kind of quantum correlation, all qubits in the system must be involved, making it much harder to generate -- and even harder to verify. Remarkably, the researchers succeeded in preparing a whole series of low-energy states that passed this test up to 24 qubits, confirming these special correlations efficiently. This result shows that quantum computers are not just getting bigger -- they are also becoming better at displaying and proving truly quantum behaviour. Why this matters This study proves that it's possible to certify deep quantum behaviour in large, complex systems -- something never done at this scale before. It's a big step toward making sure quantum computers are truly quantum. These insights are more than just theoretical. Understanding and controlling Bell correlations could improve quantum communication, make cryptography more secure, and help develop new quantum algorithms.",

      "content_text": "This schematic illustration shows the diffractive element in the high-power microcomb source separating comb lines spectrally. Credit: Michal Lipson lab A few years ago, researchers in Michal Lipson's lab noticed something remarkable. They were working on a project to improve LiDAR, a technology that uses lightwaves to measure distance. The lab was designing high-power chips that could produce brighter beams of light. \"As we sent more and more power through the chip, we noticed that it was creating what we call a frequency comb,\" says Andres Gil-Molina, a former postdoctoral researcher in Lipson's lab. A frequency comb is a special type of light that contains many colors lined up next to each other in an orderly pattern, kind of like a rainbow. Dozens of colors -- or frequencies of light -- shine brightly, while the gaps between them remain dark. When you look at a frequency comb on a spectrogram, these bright frequencies appear as spikes, or teeth on a comb. This offers the tremendous opportunity of sending dozens of streams of data simultaneously. Because the different colors of light don't interfere with each other, each tooth acts as its own channel. Today, creating a powerful frequency comb requires large and expensive lasers and amplifiers. In their new paper in Nature Photonics , Lipson, Eugene Higgins Professor of Electrical Engineering and professor of Applied Physics, and her collaborators show how to do the same thing on a single chip. \"Data centers have created tremendous demand for powerful and efficient sources of light that contain many wavelengths,\" says Gil-Molina, who is now a principal engineer at Xscape Photonics. \"The technology we've developed takes a very powerful laser and turns it into dozens of clean, high-power channels on a chip. That means you can replace racks of individual lasers with one compact device, cutting cost, saving space, and opening the door to much faster, more energy-efficient systems.\" \"This research marks another milestone in our mission to advance silicon photonics,\" Lipson said. \"As this technology becomes increasingly central to critical infrastructure and our daily lives, this type of progress is essential to ensuring that data centers are as efficient as possible.\" Cleaning up messy light The breakthrough started with a simple question: What's the most powerful laser we can put on a chip? The team chose a type called a multimode laser diode, which is used widely in applications like medical devices and laser cutting tools. These lasers can produce enormous amounts of light, but the beam is \"messy,\" which makes it hard to use for precise applications. Integrating such a laser into a silicon photonics chip, where the light pathways are just a few microns -- even hundreds of nanometers -- wide, required careful engineering. \"We used something called a locking mechanism to purify this powerful but very noisy source of light,\" Gil-Molina says. The method relies on silicon photonics to reshape and clean up the laser's output, producing a much cleaner, more stable beam, a property scientists call high coherence. Once the light is purified, the chip's nonlinear optical properties take over, splitting that single powerful beam into dozens of evenly spaced colors, a defining feature of a frequency comb. The result is a compact, high-efficiency light source that combines the raw power of an industrial laser with the precision and stability needed for advanced communications and sensing. Why it matters now The timing for this breakthrough is no accident. With the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, the infrastructure inside data centers is straining to move information fast enough, for example, between processors and memory. State-of-the-art data centers are already using fiber optic links to transport data, but most of these still rely on single-wavelength lasers. Frequency combs change that. Instead of one beam carrying one data stream, dozens of beams can run in parallel through the same fiber. That's the principle behind wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), the technology that turned the internet into a global high-speed network in the late 1990s. By making high-power, multi-wavelength combs small enough to fit directly on a chip, Lipson's team has made it possible to bring this capability into the most compact, cost-sensitive parts of modern computing systems. Beyond data centers, the same chips could enable portable spectrometers, ultra-precise optical clocks, compact quantum devices, and even advanced LiDAR systems. \"This is about bringing lab-grade light sources into real-world devices,\" says Gil-Molina. \"If you can make them powerful, efficient, and small enough, you can put them almost anywhere.\"",

      "content_text": "The TR-ARPES setup used in the research. Credit: Jeff Prine (OIST) In a world-first, researchers from the Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have directly observed the evolution of the elusive dark excitons in atomically thin materials, laying the foundation for new breakthroughs in both classical and quantum information technologies. Their findings have been published in Nature Communications . Professor Keshav Dani, head of the unit, highlights the significance: \"Dark excitons have great potential as information carriers, because they are inherently less likely to interact with light, and hence less prone to degradation of their quantum properties. However, this invisibility also makes them very challenging to study and manipulate. Building on a previous breakthrough at OIST in 2020, we have opened a route to the creation, observation, and manipulation of dark excitons.\" \"In the general field of electronics, one manipulates electron charge to process information,\" explains Xing Zhu, co-first author and PhD student in the unit. \"In the field of spintronics, we exploit the spin of electrons to carry information. Going further, in valleytronics, the crystal structure of unique materials enables us to encode information into distinct momentum states of the electrons, known as valleys.\" The ability to use the valley dimension of dark excitons to carry information positions them as promising candidates for quantum technologies. Dark excitons are by nature more resistant to environmental factors like thermal background than the current generation of qubits, potentially requiring less extreme cooling and making them less prone to decoherence, where the unique quantum state breaks down. Defining landscapes of energy with bright and dark excitons Over the past decade, progress has been made in the development of a class of atomically thin semiconducting materials known as TMDs (transition metal dichalcogenides). As with all semiconductors, atoms in TMDs are aligned in a crystal lattice, which confines electrons to a specific level (or band) of energy, such as the valence band. When exposed to light, the negatively charged electrons are excited to a higher energy state - the conduction band - leaving behind a positively charged hole in the valence band. The electrons and holes are bound together by electrostatic attraction, forming hydrogen-like quasiparticles called excitons. If certain quantum properties of the electron and hole match, i.e. they have the same spin configuration and they inhabit the same 'valley' in momentum space (the energy minima that electrons and holes can occupy in the atomic crystal structure) the two recombine within a picosecond (1ps = 10 \u221212 second), emitting light in the process. These are 'bright' excitons. However, if the quantum properties of the electron and hole do not match up, the electron and hole are forbidden from recombining on their own and do not emit light. These are characterized as 'dark' excitons. \"There are two 'species' of dark excitons,\" explains Dr. David Bacon, co-first author who is now at University College London, \"momentum-dark and spin-dark, depending on where the properties of electron and hole are in conflict. The mismatch in properties not only prevents immediate recombination, allowing them to exist up to several nanoseconds (1ns = 10 \u22129 second - a much more useful timescale), but also makes dark excitons more isolated from environmental interactions.\" \"The unique atomic symmetry of TMDs means that when exposed to a state of light with a circular polarization, one can selectively create bright excitons only in a specific valley. This is the fundamental principle of valleytronics. However, bright excitons rapidly turn into numerous dark excitons that can potentially preserve the valley information. Which species of dark excitons are involved and to what degree they can sustain the valley information is unclear, but this is a key step in the pursuit of valleytronic applications,\" explains Dr. Vivek Pareek, co-first author and OIST graduate who is now a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology. Observing electrons at the femtosecond scale Using the world-leading TR-ARPES (time- and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy) setup at OIST, which includes a proprietary, table-top XUV (extreme ultraviolet) source, the team has managed to track the characteristics of all excitons after the creation of bright excitons in a specific valley in a TMD semiconductor over time by simultaneously quantifying momentum, spin state, and population levels of electrons and holes - these properties have never been simultaneously quantified before. Their findings show that within a picosecond, some bright excitons are scattered by phonons (quantized crystal lattice vibrations) into different momentum valleys, rendering them momentum-dark. Later, spin-dark excitons dominate, where electrons have flipped spin within the same valley, persisting on nanosecond scales. With this, the team has overcome the fundamental challenge of how to access and track dark excitons, laying the foundation for dark valleytronics as a field. Dr. Julien Mad\u00e9o of the unit summarizes: \"Thanks to the sophisticated TR-ARPES setup at OIST, we have directly accessed and mapped how and what dark excitons keep long-lived valley information. Future developments to read out the dark excitons valley properties will unlock broad dark valleytronic applications across information systems.\"",

Using optical cavity and atomic clock tech, it may reveal hidden black hole mergers and relics of the early universe years ahead of schedule. Credit: Shutterstock Scientists have unveiled a new approach to detecting gravitational waves in the milli-Hertz frequency range, providing access to astrophysical and cosmological phenomena that are not detectable with current instruments. Gravitational waves\u2014ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein\u2014have been observed at high frequencies by ground-based interferometers such as LIGO and Virgo, and at ultra-low frequencies by pulsar timing arrays. However, the mid-band range has remained a scientific blind spot. Developed by researchers at the Universities of Birmingham and Sussex, the new detector concept uses cutting-edge optical cavity and atomic clock technologies to sense gravitational waves in the elusive milli-Hertz frequency band (10\u207b\u2075 \u2013 1 Hz). Publishing their proposal today (Oct. 3) in Classical and Quantum Gravity , the scientist reveal a detector that uses advances in optical resonator technology, originally developed for optical atomic clocks, to measure tiny phase shifts in laser light caused by passing gravitational waves. Unlike large-scale interferometers, these detectors are compact, relatively immune to seismic and Newtonian noise. Co-author Dr Vera Guarrera, from the University of Birmingham, commented: \u201cBy using technology matured in the context of optical atomic clocks, we can extend the reach of gravitational wave detection into a completely new frequency range with instruments that fit on a laboratory table. This opens the exciting possibility of building a global network of such detectors and searching for signals that would otherwise remain hidden for at least another decade.\u201d The milli-Hertz frequency band - sometimes called the \u2018mid-band\u2019 - is expected to host signals from a variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources, including compact binaries of white dwarfs and black hole mergers. Ambitious space missions such as LISA also target this frequency band, but they are scheduled for launch in the 2030s. The proposed optical resonator detectors could begin exploring this territory now. Co-author Professor Xavier Calmet, from the University of Sussex, commented: \u201cThis detector allows us to test astrophysical models of binary systems in our galaxy, explore the mergers of massive black holes, and even search for stochastic backgrounds from the early universe. With this method, we have the tools to start probing these signals from the ground, opening the path for future space missions.\u201d While future space-based missions like LISA will offer superior sensitivity, their operation is over a decade away. The proposed optical cavity detectors provide an immediate, cost-effective means to explore the milli-Hz band. The study also suggests that integrating these detectors with existing clock networks could extend gravitational wave detection to even lower frequencies, complementing high-frequency observatories like LIGO. Each unit consists of two orthogonal ultrastable optical cavities and an atomic frequency reference, enabling multi-channel detection of gravitational wave signals. This configuration not only enhances sensitivity but also allows for the identification of wave polarisation and source direction.",

It could shorten scan times, cut radiation doses, and make advanced diagnostics more accessible. Credit: Shutterstock Physicians rely on nuclear medicine scans, like SPECT scans, to watch the heart pump, track blood flow and detect diseases hidden deep inside the body. But today's scanners depend on expensive detectors that are difficult to make. Now, scientists led by Northwestern University and Soochow University in China have built the first perovskite-based detector that can capture individual gamma rays for SPECT imaging with record-breaking precision. The new tool could make common types of nuclear medicine imaging sharper, faster, cheaper and safer. For patients, that could mean shorter scan times, clearer results and lower doses of radiation. The study was published on Aug. 30 in the journal Nature Communications . \"Perovskites are a family of crystals best known for transforming the field of solar energy,\" said Northwestern's Mercouri Kanatzidis, the study's senior author. \"Now, they are poised to do the same for nuclear medicine. This is the first clear proof that perovskite detectors can produce the kind of sharp, reliable images that doctors need to provide the best care for their patients.\" \"Our approach not only improves the performance of detectors but also could lower costs,\" said co-corresponding author Yihui He, a professor at Soochow University. \"That means more hospitals and clinics eventually could have access to the best imaging technologies.\" Kanatzidis is a Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. Yihui He is a former postdoctoral fellow from Kanatzidis' laboratory. Nuclear medicine, like SPECT (single-photon emission computing tomography) imaging, works like an invisible camera. Physicians implant a tiny, safe, short-lived radiotracer in a specific part of a patient's body. The tracer emits gamma rays, which pass outward through tissues and eventually hit a detector outside of the body. Each gamma ray is like a pixel of light. After collecting millions of these pixels, computers can construct a 3D image of working organs. Today's detectors, which are either made from cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) or sodium iodide (NaI), have several disadvantages. CZT detectors are incredibly expensive, sometimes reaching into the price range of hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for a whole camera. Because CZT crystals are brittle and prone to cracking, these detectors also are difficult to manufacture. While cheaper than CZT detectors, NaI detectors are bulky and produce blurrier images -- like taking a photo through a foggy window. To overcome these issues, the scientists turned to perovskite crystals, a material that Kanatzidis has studied for more than a decade. In 2012, his group built the first solid-film solar cells made from perovskites. Then, in 2013, Kanatzidis discovered that single perovskite crystals were highly promising for detecting X-rays and gamma rays. This breakthrough, enabled by his group's growth of high-quality single crystals, sparked a worldwide surge of research and effectively launched a new field in hard radiation detection materials. \"This work demonstrates how far we can push perovskite detectors beyond the laboratory,\" Kanatzidis said. \"When we first discovered in 2013 that perovskite single crystals could detect X-rays and gamma rays, we could only imagine their potential. Now, we're showing that perovskite-based detectors can deliver the resolution and sensitivity needed for demanding applications like nuclear medicine imaging. It's exciting to see this technology moving closer to real-world impact.\" Building on this foundation, Kanatzidis and He led the crystal growth, surface engineering and device design for the new study. By carefully growing and shaping these crystals, the researchers created a pixelated sensor -- just like the pixels in a smartphone camera -- that delivers record-breaking clarity and stability. Leading the design and development of the prototype gamma-ray detector, He developed the camera's pixelated architecture, optimized the multi-channel readout electronics and carried out the high-resolution imaging experiments that validated the device's capabilities. He, Kanatzidis and their team demonstrated that perovskite-based detectors can achieve record energy resolutions and unprecedented single-photon imaging performance, paving the way for practical integration into next-generation nuclear medicine imaging systems. \"Designing this gamma-ray camera and demonstrating its performance has been incredibly rewarding,\" He said. \"By combining high-quality perovskite crystals with a carefully optimized pixelated detector and multi-channel readout system, we were able to achieve record-breaking energy resolution and imaging capabilities. This work shows the real potential of perovskite-based detectors to transform nuclear medicine imaging.\" In experiments, the detector was able to differentiate among gamma rays of different energies with the best resolution reported thus far. It also sensed extremely faint signals from a medical radiotracer (technetium-99m) commonly used in clinical practice and distinguished incredibly fine features, producing crisp images that could separate tiny radioactive sources spaced just a few millimeters apart. The detector also remained highly stable, collecting nearly all the tracer's signal without loss or distortion. Because these new detectors are more sensitive, patients potentially could require shorter scan times or smaller doses of radiation. Northwestern spinout company Actinia Inc. is commercializing this technology -- working with partners in the medical device field to bring it out of the lab and into hospitals. Because they are easier to grow and use simpler components, perovskites offer a far less expensive alternative to CZT and NaI detectors without sacrificing quality. Perovskite-based detectors also offer a realistic pathway to imaging using a lower dose of a radiotracer than can be used with a NaI detector but at a price that ensures widespread patient access. \"Demonstrating that perovskites can deliver single-photon gamma-ray imaging is a milestone,\" He said. \"It shows these materials are ready to move beyond the laboratory and into technologies that directly benefit human health. From here, we see opportunities to refine the detectors further, scale up production and explore entirely new directions in medical imaging.\" \"High-quality nuclear medicine shouldn't be limited to hospitals that can afford the most expensive equipment,\" Kanatzidis said. \"With perovskites, we can open the door to clearer, faster, safer scans for many more patients around the world. The ultimate goal is better scans, better diagnoses and better care for patients.\" The study, \"Single photon \u03b3-ray imaging with high energy and spatial resolution perovskite semiconductor for nuclear medicine,\" was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (award number HDTRA12020002), the Consortium for Interaction of Ionizing Radiation with Matter University Research Alliance, the National Key R&D Program of China (award number 2021YFF0502600), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (award number U2267211) and the Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (award number BK20240822).",

      "content_text": "Artist\u2019s impression of two nuclear spins, remotely entangled via the geometric gate applied via the electron. Credit: Tony Melov / UNSW Sydney UNSW engineers have made a significant advance in quantum computing: they created 'quantum entangled states' - where two separate particles become so deeply linked they no longer behave independently - using the spins of two atomic nuclei. Such states of entanglement are the key resource that gives quantum computers their edge over conventional ones. The research was published on\u00a0Sept. 18\u00a0in the journal Science , and is an important step towards building large-scale quantum computers - one of the most exciting scientific and technological challenges of the 21 st century. Lead author Dr Holly Stemp says the achievement unlocks the potential to build the future microchips needed for quantum computing using existing technology and manufacturing processes. \"We succeeded in making the cleanest, most isolated quantum objects talk to each other, at the scale at which standard silicon electronic devices are currently fabricated,\" she says. The challenge facing quantum computer engineers has been to balance two opposing needs: shielding the computing elements from external interference and noise, while still enabling them to interact to perform meaningful computations. This is why there are so many different types of hardware still in the race to be the first operating quantum computer: some are very good for performing fast operations, but suffer from noise; others are well shielded from noise, but difficult to operate and scale up. The UNSW team has invested on a platform that - until today - could be placed in the second camp. They have used the nuclear spin of phosphorus atoms, implanted in a silicon chip, to encode quantum information. \"The spin of an atomic nucleus is the cleanest, most isolated quantum object one can find in the solid state,\" says Scientia Professor Andrea Morello, UNSW School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications. \"Over the last 15 years, our group has pioneered all the breakthroughs that made this technology a real contender in the quantum computing race. We already demonstrated that we could hold quantum information for over 30 seconds - an eternity, in the quantum world - and perform quantum logic operations with less than 1% errors. \"We were the first in the world to achieve this in a silicon device, but it all came at a price: the same isolation that makes atomic nuclei so clean, makes it hard to connect them together in a large-scale quantum processor.\" Until now, the only way to operate multiple atomic nuclei was for them to be placed very close together inside a solid, and to be surrounded by one and the same electron. \"Most people think of an electron as the tiniest subatomic particle, but quantum physics tells us that it has the ability to 'spread out' in space, so that it can interact with multiple atomic nuclei,\" says Dr Holly Stemp, who conducted this research at UNSW and is now a postdoctoral researcher at MIT in Boston. \"Even so, the range over which the electron can spread is quite limited. Moreover, adding more nuclei to the same electron makes it very challenging to control each nucleus individually.\" Making atomic nuclei talk through electronic 'telephones' \"By way of metaphor one could say that, until now, nuclei were like people placed in a sound-proof room,\" Dr Stemp says. \"They can talk to each other as long as they are all in the same room, and the conversations are really clear. But they can't hear anything from the outside, and there's only so many people who can fit inside the room. This mode of conversation doesn't 'scale'. \"With this breakthrough, it's as if we gave people telephones to communicate to other rooms. All the rooms are still nice and quiet on the inside, but now we can have conversations between many more people, even if they are far away.\" The 'telephones' are, in fact, electrons. Mark van Blankenstein, another author on the paper, explains what's really going on at the sub-atomic level. \"By their ability to spread out in space, two electrons can 'touch' each other at quite some distance. And if each electron is directly coupled to an atomic nucleus, the nuclei can communicate through that.\" So how far apart were the nuclei involved in the experiments? \"The distance between our nuclei was about 20 nanometers - one thousandth of the width of a human hair,\" says Dr Stemp. \"That doesn't sound like much, but consider this: if we scaled each nucleus to the size of a person, the distance between the nuclei would be about the same as that between Sydney and Boston!\" She adds that 20 nanometers is the scale at which modern silicon computer chips are routinely manufactured to work in personal computers and mobile phones. \"You have billions of silicon transistors in your pocket or in your bag right now, each one about 20 nanometers in size. This is our real technological breakthrough: getting our cleanest and most isolated quantum objects talking to each other at the same scale as existing electronic devices. This means we can adapt the manufacturing processes developed by the trillion-dollar semiconductor industry, to the construction of quantum computers based on the spins of atomic nuclei.\" A scalable way forward Despite the exotic nature of the experiments, the researchers say these devices remain fundamentally compatible with the way all current computer chips are built. The phosphorus atoms were introduced in the chip by the team of Professor David Jamieson at the University of Melbourne, using an ultra-pure silicon slab supplied by Professor Kohei Itoh at Keio University in Japan. By removing the need for the atomic nuclei to be attached to the same electron, the UNSW team has swept aside the biggest roadblock to the scale-up of silicon quantum computers based on atomic nuclei. \"Our method is remarkably robust and scalable. Here we just used two electrons, but in the future we can even add more electrons, and force them in an elongated shape, to spread out the nuclei even further,\" Prof. Morello says. \"Electrons are easy to move around and to 'massage' into shape, which means the interactions can be switched on and off quickly and precisely. That's exactly what is needed for a scalable quantum computer.\"",

      "content_text": "A NASA artist\u2019s illustration of Artemis astronauts working on the Moon. Credit: NASA An international research collaboration has used advanced computer simulations to investigate how faint radio signals from the early Universe, soon to be observed from missions on the far side of the Moon, could shed light on the fundamental properties of dark matter, reports a new study published in Nature Astronomy on September 16, 2025. Ordinary matter, which makes up the stars, planets, and everything we can see, makes up only about 20 per cent of all matter in the Universe. The remaining 80 per cent is believed to be dark matter: a mysterious substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, and whose true nature remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in modern physics. Despite its invisibility, dark matter is known to play a vital role in the formation of galaxies, such as the Milky Way, and in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe. One of the key properties of dark matter is the mass of its constituent particles. If these particles are relatively light, such as less than about 5 per cent of electron mass, then dark matter is considered warm and would inhibit the formation of structures smaller than galaxies. However, if the particles are heavier, dark matter is classified as cold, which would promote the growth of smaller-scale structures. Astronomers have long sought to determine the dark matter particle mass by studying small-scale structures composed of gas and stars because this information is crucial for particle physicists to develop theoretical models of dark matter. A new study led by The University of Tsukuba Postdoctoral Fellow Hyunbae Park, who carried out this study during his time as a University of Tokyo Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU, WPI) Project Researcher, and including Kavli IPMU Professor and Max Planck Insitute for Astrophysics Visiting Scientist Naoki Yoshida, focused on small gas clouds that existed during the cosmic Dark Ages, the first 100 million years after the Big Bang before the formation of stars and galaxies. Because the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies involve complex and poorly understood processes, simulating their behavior accurately remains a major challenge in modern computational astrophysics. By targeting an era before these complexities arose, the researchers were able to simulate early cosmic structures with unprecedented precision. The simulation results\u00a0revealed how gas gradually cooled as the Universe expanded while developing small gas clumps via gravitational interaction with dark matter during the Dark Ages. The gas in these clumps became much denser than in the average Universe and heated up due to compression. This variation in density and temperature was imprinted in the 21-centimeter radio emission from hydrogen atoms. The team modeled this ancient signal from the primordial gas clouds and found that its sky-averaged strength depends sensitively on whether dark matter is warm or cold. According to the researchers, this difference could allow future lunar experiments to distinguish between competing dark matter scenarios. The Dark Ages signal is expected to appear at frequencies around 50 MHz or lower with a characteristic frequency modulation, and the difference between the two dark matter scenarios is less than a milli-kelvin in brightness temperature. These frequencies are heavily contaminated by human-made signals on Earth, and further obscured by the ionosphere making it virtually impossible to detect the signal from ground-based observatories. In contrast, the far side of the Moon offers a radio-quiet environment, shielded from terrestrial interference, and is considered an ideal location for detecting the elusive Dark Ages signal. Although building radio observatories on the Moon poses major technological and financial challenges, an increasing number of nations are pursuing such missions as part of the new space race, combining scientific ambition with technological advancement. With this growing international momentum, it is now considered feasible to determine the mass of dark matter particles through lunar-based observations in the coming decades. Among these nations, Japan is actively developing the Tsukuyomi project, which plans to deploy radio antennas on the Moon. The team's research provides essential theoretical guidance for these near-future missions to maximize their scientific return.",

      "content_text": "Achieving the entanglement measurement of the W state. Credit: KyotoU / Takeuchi lab The concept of quantum entanglement is emblematic of the gap between classical and quantum physics. Referring to a situation in which it is impossible to describe the physics of each photon separately, this key characteristic of quantum mechanics defies the classical expectation that each particle should have a reality of its own, which gravely concerned Einstein. Understanding the potential of this concept is essential for the realization of powerful new quantum technologies. Developing such technologies will require the ability to freely generate a multi-photon quantum entangled state, and then to efficiently identify what kind of entangled state is present. However, when performing conventional quantum tomography , a method commonly used for state estimation, the number of measurements required grows exponentially with the number of photons, posing a significant data collection problem. If available, an entangled measurement can identify the entangled state with a one-shot approach. Such a measurement for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger -- GHZ -- entangled quantum state has been realized, but for the W state , the other representative entangled multi-photon state, it has been neither proposed nor discovered experimentally. This motivated a team of researchers at Kyoto University and Hiroshima University to take on this challenge, ultimately succeeding in developing a new method of entangled measurement to identify the W state. \"More than 25 years after the initial proposal concerning the entangled measurement for GHZ states, we have finally obtained the entangled measurement for the W state as well, with genuine experimental demonstration for 3-photon W states,\" says corresponding author Shigeki Takeuchi. The team focused on the characteristics of the W state's cyclic shift symmetry , and theoretically proposed a method to create an entangled measurement using a photonic quantum circuit that performs quantum Fourier transformation for the W state of any number of photons. They created a device to demonstrate the proposed method for three photons using high-stability optical quantum circuits, which allowed the device to operate stably without active control for an extended period of time. By inserting three single photons into the device in appropriate polarization states, the team was able to demonstrate that the device can distinguish different types of three-photon W states, each corresponding to a specific non-classical correlation between the three input photons. The researchers were able to evaluate the fidelity of the entangled measurement, which is equal to the probability of obtaining the correct result for a pure W-state input. This achievement opens the door for quantum teleportation , or the transfer of quantum information. It could also lead to new quantum communication protocols, the transfer of multi-photon quantum entangled states, and new methods for measurement-based quantum computing. \"In order to accelerate the research and development of quantum technologies, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of basic concepts to come up with innovative ideas,\" says Takeuchi. In the future, the team aims to apply their method to a larger-scale, more general multi-photon quantum entangled state, and plans to develop on-chip photonic quantum circuits for entangled measurements.",

      "content_text": "Graphene\u2019s electrons just broke physics rules, flowing like a perfect, otherworldly quantum liquid. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com For several decades, a central puzzle in quantum physics has remained unsolved: Could electrons behave like a perfect, frictionless fluid with electrical properties described by a universal quantum number? This unique property of electrons has been extremely difficult to detect in any material so far because of the presence of atomic defects, impurities, and imperfections in the material. Researchers at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), along with collaborators from the National Institute for Materials Science, Japan, have now finally detected this quantum fluid of electrons in graphene - a material consisting of a single sheet of pure carbon atoms. The results, published in Nature Physics , open a new window into the quantum realm and establish graphene as a unique tabletop laboratory for exploring hitherto unseen quantum phenomena. \"It is amazing that there is so much to do on just a single layer of graphene even after 20 years of discovery,\" says Arindam Ghosh, Professor at the Department of Physics, IISc, and one of the corresponding authors of the study. The team engineered exceptionally clean samples of graphene and tracked how these materials conduct electricity and heat simultaneously. To their surprise, they discovered an inverse relationship between the two properties: as one value (electrical conductivity) increased, the other (thermal conductivity) decreased, and vice versa. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the dramatic violation of a textbook principle for metals, the Wiedemann-Franz law, which dictates that the values of electrical and thermal conductivity should be directly proportional. In their graphene samples, the IISc team observed a strong deviation from this law by a factor of more than 200 at low temperatures, demonstrating the decoupling of charge and heat conduction mechanisms. This decoupling, however, is not a random event - it turns out that both charge and heat conduction in this case rely on a material-independent universal constant which is equal to the quantum of conductance, a fundamental value related to the movement of electrons. This exotic behavior emerges at the \"Dirac point,\" a precise electronic tipping point - achieved by tweaking the number of electrons in the material - where graphene is neither a metal nor an insulator. In this state, electrons cease to act as individual particles and instead move together the way a liquid does, just like water but a hundred times less viscous. \"Since this water-like behaviour is found near the Dirac point, it is called a Dirac fluid - an exotic state of matter which mimics the quark-gluon plasma, a soup of highly energetic subatomic particles observed in particle accelerators at CERN,\" says Aniket Majumdar, first author and PhD student at the Department of Physics. The team additionally measured the viscosity of this Dirac fluid and found it to be minimally viscous, the closest possible to a perfect fluid. The findings establish graphene as an ideal low-cost platform for investigating concepts from high-energy physics and astrophysics, such as black-hole thermodynamics and entanglement entropy scaling, in a laboratory setting. From a technological perspective, the presence of Dirac fluid in graphene also holds significant potential for use in quantum sensors capable of amplifying very weak electrical signals and detecting extremely weak magnetic fields.",

      "content_text": "Using the improved superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), researchers are searching for very light dark matter. Credit: UZH About 80 percent of the universe's mass is thought to consist of dark matter. And yet, little is known about the composition and structure of the particles that make up dark matter, presenting physicists with some fundamental questions. To explore this elusive matter, researchers are attempting to capture photons, or light particles, which are produced when dark matter particles collide with the visible matter we are familiar with. Most experiments to date have focused on dark matter particles with masses that more or less overlap with those of known elementary particles. If the particles are lighter than an electron, however, it is unlikely they would be detectable with the current standard, namely detectors based on liquid xenon. So far, no experiment has succeeded in directly detecting dark matter. Yet this in itself is an important finding, as it shows that dark matter particles do not exist within the mass range and interaction strength tested. New device sensitive to lower-energy events An international team led by Laura Baudis, Titus Neupert, Bj\u00f6rn Penning and Andreas Schilling from UZH's Department of Physics has now been able to probe the existence of dark matter particles across a wide mass range below one mega electron volt (MeV). Using an improved superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), the researchers reached a sensitivity threshold of about one-tenth the mass of an electron, above which dark matter particles are highly unlikely to exist. \"This is the first time we've been able to search for dark matter particles in such a low mass range, made possible by a new detector technology,\" says first author Laura Baudis. In a 2022 proof of concept, the researchers had tested the first SNSPD device that's highly sensitive to lower-energy photons. When a photon strikes the nanowire, it heats it up slightly and causes it to instantly lose its superconductivity. The wire briefly becomes a regular conductor, and the resulting increase in electrical resistance can be measured. Detecting smallest dark matter particles For their latest experiment, the UZH scientists optimized their SNSPD for dark matter detection. In particular, they equipped it with superconducting microwires instead of nanowires to maximize its cross section. They also gave it a thin, planar geometry that makes it highly sensitive to changes in direction. Scientists assume that the Earth passes through a \"wind\" of dark matter particles, and the particle's direction therefore shifts over the course of the year depending on relative velocity. A device capable of picking up directional changes can help to filter out non-dark-matter events. \"Further technological improvements to the SNSPD could enable us to detect signals from dark matter particles with even smaller masses. We also want to deploy the system underground, where it will be better shielded from other sources of radiation,\" Titus Neupert says. Below the mass range of electrons, current models to describe dark matter face considerable astrophysical and cosmological constraints.",

      "content_text": "In the Crab Nebula, a rapidly rotating neutron star, or pulsar (white dot near the center), powers the dramatic activity seen by Chandra. The inner X-ray ring is thought to be a shock wave that marks the boundary between the surrounding nebula and the flow of matter and antimatter particles from the pulsar. Energetic particles move outward to brighten the outer ring and produce an extended X-ray glow. The jets perpendicular to the ring are due to matter and antimatter particles spewing out from the poles of the pulsar. The fingers, loops and bays visible on the outer boundary of the nebula are likely caused by confinement of the high-energy particles by magnetic forces. Credit: Chandra X-ray Observatory Pulsars may be revealing that extremely low-frequency gravitational waves are moving through the universe. Observations reported in 2023 by international pulsar timing array collaborations could be caused by either a background of overlapping gravitational waves from countless distant sources or a single pair of nearby supermassive black holes orbiting each other. To determine which explanation fits, Hideki Asada, a theoretical physicist and Professor at Hirosaki University, and Shun Yamamoto, a researcher at the Graduate School of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University, have proposed a new approach. Their method takes advantage of \"beat\" effects that occur when two gravitational waves have nearly the same frequency, searching for their subtle influence on the arrival times of pulsars' radio signals. Their findings were recently published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP). The night sky contains remarkably precise \"cosmic clocks\": pulsars, which are dense neutron stars that emit radio pulses at steady intervals, ticking like perfectly timed metronomes. On Earth, radio telescopes track these pulses not only to learn about the pulsars themselves, but also to use them as tools for studying the structure and behavior of the wider universe. If something unseen -- almost a \"cosmic ghost\" -- distorts spacetime between a pulsar and Earth, the timing of its pulses shifts slightly. These changes are not random; several pulsars in certain parts of the sky can show matching variations, as if a slow, invisible wave were passing through space. \"In 2023 several pulsar timing array collaborations -- NANOGrav in the US, and European teams -- announced strong evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves,\" Asada notes. Nanohertz means wave periods of months to years, with wavelengths of several light-years. To probe such scales, we rely on distant, stable pulsars hundreds to thousands of light-years away. \"The signal was statistically reliable but below the 5-sigma threshold that particle physicists usually require,\" he continues. \"It's 'strong evidence' but not yet a confirmed detection, but the cosmology and astrophysics community believes we are approaching the first detection of nanohertz gravitational waves.\" Although the evidence is promising, it still falls short of absolute confirmation. Asada notes that if future data strengthen the result, the next step will be to pinpoint the origin. \"There are two main candidate sources for nanohertz gravitational waves,\" he explains. \"One is cosmic inflation, which would have created spacetime fluctuations in the very early universe, later stretched to cosmic scales. The other is supermassive black hole binaries, which form when galaxies merge. Both scenarios could generate nanohertz gravitational waves.\" Distinguishing between these possibilities has been difficult because the correlation patterns seen in pulsar data -- the way timing differences between pulsars relate to each other -- were once thought to appear similar in both cases. \"In our paper, we explored the situation where a nearby pair of supermassive black holes produces a particularly strong signal,\" Asada says. \"If two such systems have very similar frequencies, their waves can interfere and create a beat pattern, like in acoustics. That feature could, in principle, allow us to distinguish them from the stochastic background of inflation.\" Asada and Yamamoto therefore leverage a familiar acoustic effect: beats. When two waves have almost -- but not exactly -- the same frequency, their superposition produces periodic strengthening and weakening. Applied to gravitational waves, two supermassive-black-hole binaries with similar frequencies would imprint a characteristic modulation in the pulsar-timing signal. The method is to look for this modulation -- the \"beat\" -- in the pulsar correlation patterns. If it's present, that strongly suggests the signal is not a diffuse background but arises from specific, relatively nearby binaries. We now await stronger confirmation of the pulsar signal's nature. \"I think once a confirmed detection at 5-sigma is achieved, maybe within a few years, the next step will be to ask: what is the origin of the waves? At that point, our method could be useful to distinguish whether they come from inflation or from nearby supermassive black hole binaries,\" Asada concludes.",

Their discovery could illuminate how the universe\u2019s first black holes and galaxies came to be. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com In the early universe, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, the first stars emerged from vast, untouched clouds of hydrogen and helium. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that some of these early stars may have been unlike the familiar (nuclear fusion-powered) stars that astronomers have studied for centuries. A new study led by Cosmin Ilie of Colgate University, together with Shafaat Mahmud (Colgate '26), Jillian Paulin (Colgate '23) at the University of Pennsylvania, and Katherine Freese at The University of Texas at Austin, has identified four extremely distant objects whose appearance and spectral signatures match what scientists expect from supermassive dark stars. \"Supermassive dark stars are extremely bright, giant, yet puffy clouds made primarily out of hydrogen and helium, which are supported against gravitational collapse by the minute amounts of self-annihilating dark matter inside them,\" Ilie said. Supermassive dark stars and their black hole remnants could be key to solving two recent astronomical puzzles: i. the larger than expected extremely bright, yet compact, very distant galaxies observed with JWST, and ii. the origin of the supermassive black holes powering the most distant quasars observed. Katherine Freese first proposed the idea of dark stars with Doug Spolyar and Paolo Gondolo, publishing their initial peer-reviewed paper on the concept in Physical Review Letters in 2008. That study outlined how dark stars might grow and eventually collapse into supermassive black holes in the early universe. In 2010, Freese, Ilie, Spolyar, and their collaborators expanded on the theory in The Astrophysical Journal , describing two possible processes that could allow dark stars to reach immense sizes and predicting that they could seed the black holes found in the earliest quasars known to exist. Dark matter is thought to make up roughly a quarter of the universe, yet its nature remains one of science's greatest mysteries. Researchers believe it is composed of a still-undetected type of elementary particle. Decades of experiments have searched for these particles, but so far without success. One leading possibility involves Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). When two WIMPs collide, they are expected to annihilate each other, releasing energy that could heat collapsing hydrogen clouds and cause them to shine as brilliant dark stars. Conditions a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, within dense regions called dark matter halos, appear to have been ideal for forming such stars. These regions are also where the first generation of normal stars was expected to appear. \"For the first time we have identified spectroscopic supermassive dark star candidates in JWST, including the earliest objects at redshift 14, only 300 Myr after the Big Bang,\" said Freese, the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics and director of the Weinberg Institute and Texas Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics at UT Austin. \"Weighing a million times as much as the Sun, such early dark stars are important not only in teaching us about dark matter but also as precursors to the early supermassive black holes seen in JWST that are otherwise so difficult to explain.\" In a 2023 PNAS study by Ilie, Paulin, and Freese, the first supermassive dark star candidates (JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0) were identified using photometric data from JWST's NIRCam instrument. Since then, spectra from JWST's NIRSpec instrument became available for those, and a few other extremely distant objects. The team, which now also includes Shafaat Mahmud analyzed the spectra and morphology of four of the most distant objects ever observed (including two candidates from the 2023 study): JADES-GS-z14-0, JADES-GS-z14-1, JADES-GS-13-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0 and found that each of them is consistent with a supermassive dark star interpretation. JADES-GS-z14-1 is not resolved, meaning it is consistent with a point source, such as a very distant supermassive star would be. The other three are extremely compact, and can be modeled by supermassive dark stars powering a nebula (i.e. ionized H and He gas surrounding the star). Each of the four objects analyzed in this study is also consistent with a galaxy interpretation, as shown in the literature. Dark stars have a smoking gun signature, an absorption feature at 1640 Angstrom, due to the large amounts of singly ionized helium in their atmospheres. And in fact, one of the four objects analyzed shows signs of this feature. \"One of the most exciting moments during this research was when we found the 1640 Angstrom absorption dip in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0. While the signal to noise ratio of this feature is relatively low (S/N~2), it is for the first time we found a potential smoking gun signature of a dark star. Which, in itself, is remarkable,\" Ilie said. Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) measured the spectrum of the same object, revealing the presence of oxygen, via a nebular emission line. Researchers said that if both spectral features are confirmed, the object cannot be an isolated dark star, but rather may be a dark star embedded in a metal rich environment. This could be the outcome of a merger, where a dark matter halo hosting a dark star merges with a galaxy. Alternatively, dark stars and regular stars could have formed in the same host halo, as the researchers now realized it is possible. The identification of supermassive dark stars would open up the possibility of learning about the dark matter particle based on the observed properties of those objects, and would establish a new field of astronomy: the study of dark matter-powered stars. This published PNAS research is a key step in this direction.

      "content_text": "Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies emit radiation and ultra-fast winds into space. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The universe is full of different types of radiation and particles that can be observed here on Earth. This includes photons across the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the lowest radio frequencies all the way to the highest-energy gamma rays. It also includes other particles such as neutrinos and cosmic rays, which race through the universe at close to the speed of light. Curiously, \"cosmic rays\" are not actually rays - this name has historical reasons - but small particles, mostly atomic nuclei, which are accelerated to enormous energies somewhere in the universe. Although their sources are not yet fully understood, they are most likely associated with some of the most extreme environments in the universe, such as black holes, supernovae, or rotating neutron stars (a type of dead star). But occasionally cosmic rays have much higher energy than usual. We've known about this since 1962, but we still have no idea why. We also don't know where this ultra-high-energy cosmic radiation comes from. Now, research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) may have found the answer to this big unanswered question in physics. Supermassive black holes may be the cause Foteini Oikonomou, an associate professor at NTNU's Department of Physics, is working on the case. In a recent article, she and her colleagues present a completely new and plausible explanation for this ultra-high-energy radiation. The lead author is PhD research fellow Domenik Ehlert from the same department. The team also includes postdoctoral fellow Enrico Peretti from the Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9. Their work focuses on astroparticle physics, which studies the relationship between the smallest particles in the universe and the universe's largest phenomena. \"We suspect that this high-energy radiation is created by winds from supermassive black holes,\" said Oikonomou. But what on earth does that mean? Active black holes create winds The Milky Way is the neighborhood in the universe where you and I live. Our Sun and solar system are part of this galaxy, along with at least 100 billion other stars. \"There is a black hole called Sagittarius-A* located right in the centre of the Milky Way. This black hole is currently in a quiet phase where it isn't consuming any stars, as there is not enough matter in the vicinity,\" Peretti said. This contrasts with growing, supermassive, active black holes that consume up to several times the mass of our own Sun each year. \"A tiny portion of the material can be pushed away by the force of the black hole before it is pulled in. As a result, around half of these supermassive black holes create winds that move through the universe at up to half the speed of light,\" Peretti said. We have known about these gigantic winds for approximately ten years. The winds from these black holes can affect galaxies. By blowing away gases, they can prevent new stars from forming, for example. This is dramatic enough in itself, but Oikonomou and her colleagues looked at something else, much smaller, that these winds could be the cause of.\" It is possible that these powerful winds accelerate the particles that create the ultra-high-energy radiation,\" said Ehlert. To understand this, we also need to explain a little bit about atoms. Atoms and enormous amounts of energy Atoms consist of a nucleus, which is made up of protons and neutrons. These particles are made up of quarks, but we don't need to go into that right now. One or more electrons can be found around this nucleus in the so-called cloud. \"The ultra-high-energy radiation consists of protons or atomic nuclei with energy up to 1020 electron volts,\" explained Oikonomou. If that number doesn't mean anything to you, you should know that in this context, it is an absolutely enormous amount of energy. \"A particle like this, which is smaller than an atom, contains about as much energy as a tennis ball when Serena Williams serves it at 200 kilometers per hour,\" said Oikonomou. It corresponds to approximately a billion times more energy than the particles created by researchers in the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland and France. Fortunately, these cosmic rays are destroyed by the Earth's atmosphere. When they reach ground level, they are as harmless as all the other cosmic radiation that reaches us at the Earth's surface. \"But for astronauts, cosmic radiation is a very serious problem,\" Oikonomou said. Airline crews don't need to worry about this because they don't fly high enough. \"The main concern for astronauts is cosmic low-energy radiation produced by our own Sun, because it is much more common. The rays we study are infrequent enough that it is extremely unlikely they would pass through an astronaut,\" she said. Other suspects Previously, researchers have looked into whether these high-energy particles come from gamma-ray bursts, from galaxies that are creating new stars at an extremely high rate, or from plasma outflows from supermassive black holes. However, Oikonomou and her colleagues have another hypothesis. \"All the other hypotheses are very good guesses - they are all sources that contain a lot of energy. But no one has provided evidence that any of them are the source. That is why we decided to investigate the winds from the supermassive black holes,\" said Ehlert. Guilty? Maybe So what do we actually know? Is it the winds that create the high-energy particles in the cosmic radiation? \"Our answer is more of a cautious 'maybe',\" said Oikonomou. That doesn't sound particularly dramatic. However, when researchers ask questions like this, they often feel a sense of excitement and think \"YES, that might just be the case!,\" but that doesn't mean it is the case in this instance. \"We find that the conditions related to these winds align particularly well with particle acceleration. But we are still unable to prove that it is specifically these winds that accelerate the particles behind the high-energy cosmic radiation,\" Oikonomou said. However, the model the researchers are using can explain one specific aspect of these particles that we still don't understand. Within a certain energy range, the particles have a chemical composition that other models cannot explain in any meaningful way. \"We can also test the model using neutrino experiments,\" said Oikonomou. That, however, is something for a completely different article. \"In the years to come, we hope to collaborate with neutrino astronomers to test our hypothesis,\" Oikonomou said. Perhaps they will then find more evidence, one way or the other.",

      "content_text": "The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment has released its most precise results yet in the search for dark matter. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com Determining the nature of dark matter, the invisible substance that makes up most of the mass in our universe, is one of the greatest puzzles in physics. New results from the world's most sensitive dark matter detector, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), have narrowed down the possibilities for one of the leading dark matter candidates: weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). \"While we always hope to discover a new particle, it is important for particle physics that we are able to set bounds on what the dark matter might actually be,\" said UC Santa Barbara experimental physicist Hugh Lippincott. Scientists have suspected the existence of dark matter for decades, but it remains a mysterious substance -- one that nevertheless plays a fundamental role in the structure of the universe. LZ hunts for dark matter from a cavern nearly one mile underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota. The experiment's new results explore weaker dark matter interactions than ever searched before and further limit what WIMPs could be. The results analyze 280 days' worth of data: a new set of 220 days (collected between March 2023 and April 2024) combined with 60 earlier days from LZ's first run. The experiment plans to collect 1,000 days' worth of data before it ends in 2028. The inner portion of the LZ detector consists of two nested titanium tanks filled with ten tonnes of transparent pure liquid xenon, which is so dense it creates a highly isolated environment, free from the \"noise\" of the outside world and perfect for capturing the faintest of faint signals that could be indicative of a WIMP. The hope is for a WIMP to knock into a xenon nucleus, causing it to move, much like a hit from a cue ball in a game of pool. By collecting the light and electrons emitted during interactions, LZ captures potential WIMP signals alongside other data. This liquid xenon core is surrounded by a much larger Outer Detector (OD) -- acrylic tanks filled with gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator. LZ's sensitivity comes from the myriad ways the detector can reduce backgrounds, the false signals that can impersonate or hide a dark matter interaction. Deep underground, the detector is shielded from cosmic rays coming from space. To reduce natural radiation from everyday objects, LZ was built from thousands of ultraclean, low-radiation parts. The detector is built like an onion, with each layer either blocking outside radiation or tracking particle interactions to rule out dark matter mimics. And, sophisticated new analysis techniques help rule out background interactions. UCSB was one of the founding groups in LZ, led by UCSB physicist Harry Nelson, who hosted the first LZ meeting at UCSB in 2012. The team currently consists of faculty members Lippincott and Nelson, postdoctoral researchers Chami Amarasinghe and TJ Whitis, and graduate students Jeonghwa Kim, Makayla Trask, Lindsey Weeldreyer, and Jordan Thomas. Other contributors to the result include recent Ph.D. recipient Jack Bargemann, now a postdoctoral researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and former undergraduate researcher; Tarun Advaith Kumar, now a graduate student at the Perimeter Institute. The physics coordinator for the result was Scott Haselschwardt, who received his Ph.D. from UCSB in 2018 and is now an assistant professor at the University of Michigan. Neutrons, subatomic particles that exist in every atom save hydrogen, are among the most common confounders of WIMP signals. Nelson and UCSB led the design, fabrication, and commissioning of the OD, the critical component that allows the collaboration to rule out these particles and enable a real discovery. \"The tricky thing about neutrons is that they also interact with the xenon nuclei, giving off a signal identical to what we expect from WIMPs,\" Trask said. \"The OD is excellent at detecting neutrons, and confirms a WIMP detection by not having any response.\" Presence of a pulse in the OD can veto an otherwise perfect candidate for a WIMP detection. Radon is also a WIMP mimic, for which the scientists must be vigilant. \"Radon undergoes a particular sequence of decays, some of which could be mistaken for WIMPs,\" Bargemann said. \"One of the things we were able to do in this run was look out for the whole set of decays in the detector to identify the radon and avoid confusing them for WIMPs.\" To enable a strong result and eliminate unconscious bias, the LZ collaboration applied a technique called \"salting,\" which adds fake WIMP signals during data collection. By camouflaging the real data until \"unsalting\" at the very end, researchers can avoid unconscious bias and keep from overly interpreting or changing their analysis. \"We're pushing the boundary into a regime where people have not looked for dark matter before,\" said Haselschwardt. \"There's a human tendency to want to see patterns in data, so it's really important when you enter this new regime that no bias wanders in. If you make a discovery, you want to get it right.\" With these results, the field of possibilities for what WIMPs may be has narrowed dramatically, allowing all scientists searching for dark matter to better focus their searches and reject incorrect models of how the universe operates. It's a long game, with more data collection in the future and one that will do more than accelerate the search for dark matter. \"Our experiment is also sensitive to rare events with roots in diverse areas of physics,\" Amarasinghe said. \"Some examples are solar neutrinos, the fascinating decays of certain xenon isotopes, and even other types of dark matter. With the intensity of this result behind us, I'm very excited to spend more time on these searches.\" \"The UCSB Physics Department has a long history of devising searches for dark matter, starting with one of the first published results of a search in 1988,\" Nelson said. Previous faculty members include David Caldwell (now deceased), and Michael Witherell, now director of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. David Hale (now retired) pioneered many of the techniques for suppressing fake dark matter signals which are now employed throughout the field of dark matter searches. \"UCSB, through the Physics Department, the College of Letters and Science, the administration, and through private donations, has strongly supported the dark matter effort for decades, and made substantial contributions to LZ.\" LZ is a collaboration of roughly 250 scientists from 38 institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, Portugal, Switzerland, South Korea, and Australia; much of the work building, operating, and analyzing the record-setting experiment is done by early career researchers. The collaboration is already looking forward to analyzing the next data set and extending our data analysis techniques to seek signals from lower-mass dark matter. Scientists are also thinking through potential upgrades to further improve LZ, and planning for a next-generation dark matter detector called XLZD. LZ is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of High Energy Physics and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science user facility. LZ is also supported by the Science & Technology Facilities Council of the United Kingdom; the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; the Swiss National Science Foundation, and the Institute for Basic Science, Korea. More than 38 institutions of higher education and advanced research provided support to LZ. The assistance of the Sanford Underground Research Facility has at all times been critical for UCSB efforts to LZ.",

      "content_text": "When two black holes collide and merge, they release gravitational waves. These waves can be detected by sensitive instruments on Earth, allowing scientists to determine the mass and spin of the black holes. The clearest black hole merger signal yet, named GW250114 and recorded by LIGO in January 2025, offers new insights into these mysterious objects. Credit: Maggie Chiang for Simons Foundation A decade ago, scientists first detected ripples in the fabric of space-time, called gravitational waves, from the collision of two black holes. Now, thanks to improved technology and a bit of luck, a newly detected black hole merger is providing the clearest evidence yet of how black holes work -- and, in the process, offering long-sought confirmation of fundamental predictions by Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. The new measurements were made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with analyses led by astrophysicists Maximiliano Isi and Will Farr of the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City. The results reveal insights into the properties of black holes and the fundamental nature of space-time, hinting at how quantum physics and Einstein's general relativity fit together. \"This is the clearest view yet of the nature of black holes,\" says Isi, who is also an assistant professor at Columbia University. \"We've found some of the strongest evidence yet that astrophysical black holes are the black holes predicted from Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.\" The results were reported in a paper published September 10 in Physical Review Letters by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. For massive stars, black holes are the final stage in their evolution. Black holes are so dense that even light cannot escape their gravity. When two black holes collide, the event distorts space itself, creating ripples in space-time that fan out across the universe, like sound waves ringing out from a struck bell. Those space-deforming ripples, called gravitational waves, can tell scientists a great deal about the objects that created them. Just as a large iron bell makes different sounds than a smaller aluminum bell, the \"sound\" a black hole merger makes is specific to the properties of the black holes involved. Scientists can detect gravitational waves with special instruments at observatories such as LIGO in the United States, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. These instruments carefully measure how long it takes a laser to travel a given path. As gravitational waves stretch and compress space-time, the length of the instrument, and thus the light's travel time, changes minutely. By measuring those tiny changes with great precision, scientists can use them to determine the black holes' characteristics. The newly reported gravitational waves were found to be created by a merger that formed a black hole with the mass of 63 suns and spinning at 100 revolutions per second. The findings come 10 years after LIGO made the first black hole merger detection. Since that landmark discovery, improvements in equipment and techniques have enabled scientists to get a much clearer look at these space-shaking events. \"The new pair of black holes are almost twins to the historic first detection in 2015,\" Isi says. \"But the instruments are much better, so we're able to analyze the signal in ways that just weren't possible 10 years ago.\" With these new signals, Isi and his colleagues got a complete look at the collision from the moment the black holes first careened into each other until the final reverberations as the merged black hole settled into its new state, which happened only milliseconds after first contact. Previously, the final reverberations were difficult to capture, as by that point, the ringing of the black hole would be very faint. As a result, scientists couldn't separate the ringing of the collision from that of the final black hole itself. In 2021, Isi led a study showcasing a cutting-edge method that he, Farr and others developed to isolate certain frequencies -- or 'tones' -- using data from the 2015 black hole merger. This method proved powerful, but the 2015 measurements weren't clear enough to confirm key predictions about black holes. With the new, more precise measurements, though, Isi and his colleagues were more confident they had successfully isolated the milliseconds-long signal of the final, settled black hole. This enabled more unambiguous tests of the nature of black holes. \"Ten milliseconds sounds really short, but our instruments are so much better now that this is enough time for us to really analyze the ringing of the final black hole,\" Isi says. \"With this new detection, we have an exquisitely detailed view of the signal both before and after the black hole merger.\" The new observations allowed scientists to test a key conjecture dating back decades that black holes are fundamentally simple objects. In 1963, physicist Roy Kerr used Einstein's general relativity to mathematically describe black holes with one equation. The equation showed that astrophysical black holes can be described by just two characteristics: spin and mass. With the new, higher-quality data, the scientists were able to measure the frequency and duration of the ringing of the merged black hole more precisely than ever before. This allowed them to see that, indeed, the merged black hole is a simple object, described by just its mass and spin. The observations were also used to test a foundational idea proposed by Stephen Hawking called Hawking's area theorem. It states that the size of a black hole's event horizon -- the line past which nothing, not even light, can return -- can only ever grow. Testing whether this theorem applies requires exceptional measurements of black holes before and after their merger. Following the first black hole merger detection in 2015, Hawking wondered if the merger signature could be used to confirm his theorem. At the time, no one thought it was possible. By 2019, a year after Hawking's death, methods had improved enough that a first tentative confirmation came using techniques developed by Isi, Farr, and colleagues. With four times better resolution, the new data gives scientists much more confidence that Hawking's theorem is correct. In confirming Hawking's theorem, the results also hint at connections to the second law of thermodynamics. This law states that a property that measures a system's disorder, known as entropy, must increase, or at least remain constant, over time. Understanding the thermodynamics of black holes could lead to advances in other areas of physics, including quantum gravity, which aims to merge general relativity with quantum physics. \"It's really profound that the size of a black hole's event horizon behaves like entropy,\" Isi says. \"It has very deep theoretical implications and means that some aspects of black holes can be used to mathematically probe the true nature of space and time.\" Many suspect that future black hole merger detections will only reveal more about the nature of these objects. In the next decade, detectors are expected to become 10 times more sensitive than today, allowing for more rigorous tests of black hole characteristics. \"Listening to the tones emitted by these black holes is our best hope for learning about the properties of the extreme space-times they produce,\" says Farr, who is also a professor at Stony Brook University. \"And as we build more and better gravitational wave detectors, the precision will continue to improve.\" \"For so long this field has been pure mathematical and theoretical speculation,\" Isi says. \"But now we're in a position of actually seeing these amazing processes in action, which highlights how much progress there's been -- and will continue to be -- in this field.\"",

      "content_text": "Scientists have experimentally reshaped quantum uncertainty, achieving precision once thought impossible under Heisenberg\u2019s principle. This breakthrough could fuel ultra-sensitive sensors for navigation, medicine, and astronomy. Credit: Shutterstock Physicists in Australia and Britain have reshaped quantum uncertainty to sidestep the restriction imposed by the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle - a result that could underpin future ultra-precise sensor technology used in navigation, medicine and astronomy. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, introduced in 1927, says that you can't know certain pairs of properties - such as a particle's position and momentum - with unlimited precision at the same time. In other words, there is always a trade-off in uncertainty: the more closely one property is pinned down, the less certainty there is about the other. In research published Sept. 24\u00a0in Science Advances , a team led by Dr Tingrei Tan from the University of Sydney Nano Institute and School of Physics has shown how to engineer a different trade-off to precisely measure position and momentum at the same time. \"Think of uncertainty like air in a balloon,\" said Dr Tan, a Sydney Horizon Fellow in the Faculty of Science. \"You can't remove it without popping the balloon, but you can squeeze it around to shift it. That's effectively what we've done. We push the unavoidable quantum uncertainty to places we don't care about (big, coarse jumps in position and momentum) so the fine details we do care about can be measured more precisely.\" The researchers also use the analogy of a clock to explain their findings (see image). Think of a normal clock with two hands: the hour hand and the minute hand. Now imagine the clock only has one hand. If it's the hour hand, you can tell what hour it is and roughly what minute, but the minute reading will be very imprecise. If the clock only has the minute hand, you can read the minutes very precisely, but you lose track of the larger context - specifically, which hour you're in. This 'modular' measurement sacrifices some global information in exchange for much finer detail. \"By applying this strategy in quantum systems, we can measure the changes in both position and momentum of a particle far more precisely,\" said first author Dr Christophe Valahu from the Quantum Control Laboratory team at the University of Sydney. \"We give up global information but gain the ability to detect tiny changes with unprecedented sensitivity.\" Quantum computing tools for a new sensing protocol This strategy was outlined theoretically in 2017. Here, Dr Tan's team performed the first experimental demonstration by using a technological approach they had previously developed for error-corrected quantum computers, a result recently published in Nature Physics . \"It's a neat crossover from quantum computing to sensing,\" said co-author Professor Nicolas Menicucci, a theorist from RMIT University. \"Ideas first designed for robust quantum computers can be repurposed so that sensors pick up weaker signals without being drowned out by quantum noise. The Sydney team implemented the sensing protocol using the tiny vibrational motion of a trapped ion - the quantum equivalent of a pendulum. They prepared the ion in \"grid states,\" a kind of quantum state originally developed for error-corrected quantum computing. With this, they showed that both position and momentum can be measured together with precision beyond the 'standard quantum limit' - the best achievable using only classical sensors. \"We haven't broken Heisenberg's principle. Our protocol works entirely within quantum mechanics,\" said Dr Ben Baragiola, co-author from RMIT. \"The scheme is optimised for small signals, where fine details matter more than coarse ones. Why it matters The ability to detect extremely small changes is important across science and technology. Ultra-precise quantum sensors could sharpen navigation in environments where GPS doesn't work (such as submarines, underground or spaceflight); enhance biological and medical imaging; monitor materials and gravitational systems; or probe fundamental physics. While still at the laboratory stage, the experiment demonstrates a new framework for future sensing technologies targeted towards measuring tiny signals. Rather than replacing existing approaches, it adds a complementary tool to the quantum-sensing toolbox. \"Just as atomic clocks transformed navigation and telecommunications, quantum-enhanced sensors with extreme sensitivity could enable whole new industries,\" said Dr Valahu. A collaborative effort This project united experimentalists at the University of Sydney with theorists at RMIT, the University of Melbourne, Macquarie University and the University of Bristol in Britain. It shows how collaboration across institutions and borders can accelerate progress and strengthen Australia's quantum research community. \"This work highlights the power of collaboration and the international connections that drive discovery,\" Dr Tan said.",

      "content_text": "Superheavy charged gravitinos may finally crack the Dark Matter mystery\u2014and bring us closer to unifying the forces of nature. Credit: Shutterstock Dark Matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in fundamental physics. Many theoretical proposals (axions, WIMPs) and 40 years of extensive experimental search failed to provide any explanation of the nature of Dark Matter. Several years ago, in a theory unifying particle physics and gravity, new, radically different Dark Matter candidates were proposed, superheavy charged gravitinos. Very recent paper in Physical Review Research by scientists from the University of Warsaw and Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, shows how new underground detectors, in particular JUNO detector starting soon to take data, even though designed for neutrino physics, are also extremely well suited to eventually detect charged Dark Matter gravitinos. The simulations combining two fields, elementary particle physics and very advanced quantum chemistry, show that the gravitino signal in the detector should be unique and unambiguous. In 1981 Murray Gell-Mann, Nobel Prize laureate for the introduction of quarks as fundamental constituents of matter, noticed the intriguing fact that the particles of the Standard Model, quarks and leptons, are contained in a theory formulated purely mathematically 2 years earlier, N=8 supergravity, distinguished by its maximal symmetry. N=8 supergravity contains, besides Standard Model matter particles of spin 1/2, also gravitational part: graviton (of spin 2) and 8 gravitinos of spin 3/2. If the Standard Model is indeed related to N=8 supergravity, the relation may possibly point to a path to solve the most difficult problem of fundamental theoretical physics -- unifying gravity with particle physics. N=8 supergravity in the spin \u00bd sector contains exactly 6 quarks (u,d,c,s,t,b) and 6 leptons (electron, muon, taon and neutrinos) and forbids the presence of any other matter particles. After 40 years of intensive accelerator research failing to discover any new matter particles the N=8 supergravity matter content is not only consistent with our knowledge but remains the only known theoretical explanation of the number of quarks and leptons in the Standard Model! However, direct connection of N=8 supergravity with the Standard Model had several drawbacks, the main one being that the electric charges of quarks and leptons were shifted by \u00b11/6 with respect to the known values, for example electron had charge -5/6 instead of -1. Several years ago Krzysztof Meissner from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw, Poland and Hermann Nicolai from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute/AEI), Potsdam, Germany returned to the Gell-Mann's idea and were able to go beyond N=8 supergravity and modify the original proposal obtaining correct electric charges of the Standard Model matter particles. The modification is very far reaching pointing to an infinite symmetry K(E10), little known mathematically and replacing the usual symmetries of the Standard Model. One of the surprising outcomes of the modification, described in papers in Physical Review Letters and Physical Review, is the fact that the gravitinos, presumably of the extremely large mass close to the Planck scale i.e. billion billion proton masses, are electrically charged: 6 of them have charge \u00b11/3 and 2 of them \u00b12/3. The gravitinos, even though they are extremally massive, cannot decay since there are no particles they could decay into. Meissner and Nicolai proposed therefore that 2 gravitinos of charge \u00b12/3 (the other 6 have much lower abundance) could be Dark Matter particles of very different kind than anything proposed so far. Namely, the widely advertized usual candidates, either extremely light like axions or intermediate (proton) mass like WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) were electrically neutral, in compatibility with the name 'Dark Matter'. However, after more than 40 years of intensive search by many different methods and devices no new particles beyond the Standard Model were detected. However, gravitinos present a new alternative. Even though they are electrically charged, they can be Dark Matter candidates because being so massive they are extremely rare and therefore observationally 'do not shine on the sky' and avoid the very tight constraints on the charge of Dark Matter constituents. Moreover, the electric charge of gravitinos suggested a completely different way of trying to prove their existence. The original paper in 2024 in Eur. Phys. J. by Meissner and Nicolai pointed out that neutrino detectors, based on scintillators different from water, could be suitable for the detection of Dark Matter gravitinos. However, the search is made enormously difficult by their extreme rarity (presumably only one gravitino per 10,000 km3 in the Solar System), which is why there is no prospect of detection with currently available detectors. However, new giant, oil or liquid argon underground detectors, are either constructed or planned and realistic possibilities for searching for these particles are now opening up. Among all detectors, the Chinese Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) now under construction, seems predestined for such a search. It aims to determine the properties of neutrinos (actually antineutrinos) but since neutrinos interact extremely weakly with matter the detectors must have very large volumes. In the case of the JUNO detector, this means 20,000 tons of an organic, synthetic oil-like liquid, commonly used in chemical industry, with special additions, in a spherical vessel with a diameter of approximately 40 meters with more than 17 thousand photomultipliers around the sphere. JUNO is scheduled to begin measurements in the second half of 2025. The recently published paper in Physical Review Research by Meissner and Nicolai, with collaborators Adrianna Kruk and Michal Lesiuk from the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Warsaw, presents a detailed analysis of the specific signatures that events caused by gravitinos could produce at JUNO and in future liquid argon detectors such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) in the United States. The paper describes not only the theoretical background both on the physics and chemistry sides but also very detailed simulation of the possible signatures as a function of the velocity and track of a gravitino traveling through the oil vessel. It required very advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry and intensive CPU-time consuming calculations. The simulations had to take into account many possible backgrounds - decay of radioactive C14 present in the oil, dark count rate and efficiency of photomultipliers, absorption of photons in oil etc. The simulations show that, with the appropriate software, passage of a gravitino through the detector will leave a unique signal impossible to be wrongly identified with a passage of any of the presently known particles. The analysis sets new standards in terms of interdisciplinarity by combining two different areas of research: theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics on one hand and very advanced methods of modern quantum chemistry on the other. The detection of the superheavy gravitinos would be a major step forward in the search for a unified theory of gravity and particles. Since gravitinos are predicted to have masses on the order of the Planck mass, their detection would be the first direct indication of physics near the Planck scale and could thus provide valuable experimental evidence for a unification of all forces of nature.",

      "content_text": "A face captured in the infrared. Credit: Shlok J. Paul Manufacturers of infrared cameras face a growing problem: the toxic heavy metals in today's infrared detectors are increasingly banned under environmental regulations, forcing companies to choose between performance and compliance. This regulatory pressure is slowing the broader adoption of infrared detectors across civilian applications, just as demand in fields like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging and national security is accelerating. In a paper published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, researchers at NYU Tandon School of Engineering reveal a potential solution that uses environmentally friendly quantum dots to detect infrared light without relying on mercury, lead, or other restricted materials. The researchers use colloidal quantum dots which upends the age-old, expensive, and tedious processing of infrared detectors. Traditional devices are fabricated through slow, ultra-precise methods that place atoms almost one by one across the pixels of a detector -- much like assembling a puzzle piece by piece under a microscope. Colloidal quantum dots are instead synthesized entirely in solution, more like brewing ink, and can be deposited using scalable coating techniques similar to those used in roll-to-roll manufacturing for packaging or newspapers. This shift from painstaking assembly to solution-based processing dramatically reduces manufacturing costs and opens the door to widespread commercial applications. \"The industry is facing a perfect storm where environmental regulations are tightening just as demand for infrared imaging is exploding,\" said Ayaskanta Sahu, associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) at NYU Tandon and the study's senior author. \"This creates real bottlenecks for companies trying to scale up production of thermal imaging systems.\" Another challenge the researchers addressed was making the quantum dot ink conductive enough to relay signals from incoming light. They achieved this using a technique called solution-phase ligand exchange, which tailors the quantum dot surface chemistry to enhance performance in electronic devices. Unlike traditional fabrication methods that often leave cracked or uneven films, this solution-based process yields smooth, uniform coatings in a single step -- ideal for scalable manufacturing. The resulting devices show remarkable performance: they respond to infrared light on the microsecond timescale -- for comparison, the human eye blinks at speeds hundreds of times slower -- and they can detect signals as faint as a nanowatt of light. \"What excites me is that we can take a material long considered too difficult for real devices and engineer it to be more competitive,\" said graduate researcher Shlok J. Paul, lead author on the study. \"With more time this material has the potential to shine deeper in the infrared spectrum where few materials exist for such tasks.\" This work adds to earlier research from the same lead researchers that developed new transparent electrodes using silver nanowires. Those electrodes remain highly transparent to infrared light while efficiently collecting electrical signals, addressing one component of the infrared camera system. Combined with their earlier transparent electrode work, these developments address both major components of infrared imaging systems. The quantum dots provide environmentally compliant sensing capability, while the transparent electrodes handle signal collection and processing. This combination addresses challenges in large-area infrared imaging arrays, which require high-performance detection across wide areas and signal readout from millions of individual detector pixels. The transparent electrodes allow light to reach the quantum dot detectors while providing electrical pathways for signal extraction. \"Every infrared camera in a Tesla or smartphone needs detectors that meet environmental standards while remaining cost-effective,\" Sahu said. \"Our approach could help make these technologies much more accessible.\" The performance still falls short of the best heavy-metal-based detectors in some measurements. However, the researchers expect continued advances in quantum dot synthesis and device engineering could reduce this gap. In addition to Sahu and Paul, the paper's authors are Letian Li, Zheng Li, Thomas Kywe, and Ana Vataj, all from NYU Tandon CBE.

      "content_text": "Scientists may have found the first practical way to catch a glimpse of quantum warmth from empty space. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com Researchers at Hiroshima University have developed a realistic, highly sensitive method to detect the Unruh effect -- a long-predicted phenomenon at the crossroads of relativity and quantum theory. Their novel approach opens new possibilities for exploring fundamental physics and for developing advanced technologies. The work was recently published in Physical Review Letters . The Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect, or simply the Unruh effect, is a striking theoretical prediction at the profound intersection of Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Quantum Theory. \"In quantum theory, even the vacuum seethes with tiny energy fluctuations, where particles and antiparticles briefly appear and vanish. Remarkably, the Unruh effect shows how these 'vacuum ripples' are perceived depends on the observer's motion. A stationary observer sees nothing, but an observer undergoing acceleration perceives them as real particles with a thermal energy distribution -- a 'quantum warmth',\" said Noriyuki Hatakenaka, professor emeritus at Hiroshima University. The counterintuitive result emphasizes the important connection between these two pillars of modern physics. If scientists could experimentally verify the Unruh effect, it would not only bridge the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics but also provide profound insights into the nature of spacetime itself. Yet the experimental verification of the Unruh effect has been a long-standing and significant challenge in fundamental physics. \"The core problem has been the extraordinarily large accelerations -- on the order of 10 20 m/s 2 -- required to make this effect detectable, rendering its observation practically impossible with current technology at least in linear acceleration systems,\" said Haruna Katayama, assistant professor at Hiroshima University. The researchers at Hiroshima University have proposed a promising approach to observe the Unruh effect. \"Our work aims to overcome this fundamental hurdle by proposing a novel and feasible experimental method. We utilize the circular motion of metastable fluxon-antifluxon pairs within coupled annular Josephson junctions,\" said Hatakenaka. Advances in superconducting microfabrication allow the creation of circuits with extremely small radii, enabling immensely high effective accelerations and producing an Unruh temperature of a few kelvin -- high enough to be experimentally detectable with current technology. \"We have proposed a realistic, highly sensitive, and unambiguous method to detect the elusive Unruh effect. Our proposed system offers a clear pathway to experimentally observe this 'phantom heat' of acceleration for the first time,\" said Katayama. In their innovative setup, the \"quantum warmth\" induced by the circular acceleration causes fluctuations that trigger the splitting of the metastable fluxon-antifluxon pairs. Crucially, this splitting event manifests as a clear, macroscopic voltage jump across the superconducting circuit. This voltage jump serves as an undeniable and easily measurable signal, providing a direct and robust signature of the Unruh effect's presence. By statistically analyzing the distribution of these voltage jumps, the researchers can precisely measure the Unruh temperature with high accuracy. \"One of the most surprising aspects is that microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce sudden, macroscopic voltage jumps, making the elusive Unruh effect directly observable. Even more striking, the switching distribution shifts solely with acceleration while all other parameters remain fixed -- a clear statistical fingerprint of the Unruh effect itself,\" said Hatakenaka. Looking ahead, Katayama said, \"Our immediate next step is to conduct a detailed analysis of the decay processes of the fluxon-antifluxon pairs. This includes thoroughly investigating the role of macroscopic quantum tunneling, a quantum-mechanical phenomenon where particles can pass through potential barriers, which was not extensively explored in this initial work. Understanding these intricate decay mechanisms will be crucial for refining the experimental detection of the Unruh effect.\" Their ultimate goal in this research is multifaceted. Beyond the immediate detection, they aim to investigate potential connections between this phenomenon and other quantum fields coupled to their detector. \"By deepening our understanding of these novel quantum phenomena, we hope to contribute significantly to the search for a unified theory of all physical laws,\" said Hatakenaka. The researchers note that the highly sensitive and broad-range detection capabilities developed in this research hold immense promise for paving the way for future applications, particularly in the field of advanced quantum sensing technologies. \"We aspire for this work to open new avenues in fundamental physics and to inspire further exploration into the true nature of spacetime and quantum reality,\" said Katayama.

      "content_text": "Scientists found that the faint magnetic fields born in the early Universe still influence the cosmic web today. Their findings, backed by massive simulations, redefine the strength of these fields and their role in cosmic evolution. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com The magnetic fields that formed in the very early stages of the Universe, may have been billions of times weaker than a small fridge magnet, with strengths comparable to magnetism generated by neurons in the human brain. Yet, despite such weakness, quantifiable traces of their existence still remain in the cosmic web, the visible cosmic structures connected throughout the Universe. These conclusions emerge from a study using around a quarter of a million computer simulations, conducted by a team from SISSA (the International School for Advanced Studies based in Trieste) in collaboration with the Universities of Hertfordshire, Cambridge, Nottingham, Stanford, and Potsdam. Observational data were subsequently used to validate these findings. The research, recently published in Physical Review Letters , specifies both possible and maximum values for the strengths of primordial magnetic fields. It also offers the possibility of refining our knowledge of the early Universe and the formation of the first stars and galaxies. A magnetic cosmic web \"The cosmic web, of which much remains to be discovered, is a filamentary structure connecting the galaxies that permeates the Universe. One of its many unsolved mysteries is why it is magnetized, not only near galaxies, where this might be expected, but also in distant regions that are sparsely populated and constitute the bulk of the cosmic web. This is harder to explain.\" These comments come from Mak Pavi\u010devi\u0107, a SISSA PhD student and lead author of the research, and Matteo Viel, his supervisor and co-author of the study. \"Our hypothesis was that this could be a legacy of events occurring in cosmic epochs during the birth of the Universe, and that magnetism was linked essentially to physical processes in the primordial Universe. For example, the filaments would have become magnetized during the inflation process before the so-called \"Big Bang\" or through events in later epochs, called phase transitions. This is what we sought to ascertain with our work. We also wished to assess the magnitude of these primordial magnetic fields through our investigations, establishing an upper limit and attempting to measure their strengths.\" At the origin of the Universe with a quarter of a million simulations The international team used over 250,000 computer simulations to study the cosmic web and better understand the influence of primordial magnetic fields. Vid Ir\u0161i\u010d from University of Hertfordshire, and a co-author of the study, emphasizes that \"these are the most realistic and largest suite state-of-the-art simulations of the influence of primordial magnetic field on the intergalactic cosmic web.\" Pavi\u010devi\u0107 and Viel explain: \"By comparing these simulations with observational data, we saw that our hypotheses were correct. When the influence of primordial fields is included in the picture, the cosmic web looks different and more in agreement with observed data. In particular, we can say that a standard model of the Universe with a very weak magnetic field of around 0.2 nano-gauss actually fits experimental data much better.\" The magnitude of primordial magnetic fields: a new upper limit The scientists have derived a particularly low value for the magnitude of the primordial magnetic fields, establishing a new upper limit several times lower than previously estimated. Pavi\u010devi\u0107 and Viel continue: \"Our research thus places strict limits on the intensity of magnetic fields formed in the very early moments of the Universe and is consistent with recent results obtained in independent data and studies on the cosmic microwave background. The two scientists explain: \"This evidence will help us to improve our understanding of events in the early Universe. The magnetic field would have increased the density of the cosmic web, in turn accelerating the process of star and galaxy formation. It will be possible to further validate our results through observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope.\" Vid Ir\u0161i\u010d concludes: \"Not only will these new limits help us understand the impact of the primordial magnetic fields on the evolution of the Cosmo, but they also hold important implications for other theoretical models that enhance structure formation.\"",

This image depicts the density of neutrinos within the remnant as varying textures, and the colors represent energy densities of different neutrino flavors. Credit: David Radice research group / Penn State The collision and merger of two neutron stars -- the incredibly dense remnants of collapsed stars -- are some of the most energetic events in the universe, producing a variety of signals that can be observed on Earth. New simulations of neutron star mergers by a team from Penn State and the University of Tennessee Knoxville reveal that the mixing and changing of tiny particles called neutrinos that can travel astronomical distances undisturbed impacts how the merger unfolds, as well as the resulting emissions. The findings have implications for longstanding questions about the origins of metals and rare earth elements as well as understanding physics in extreme environments, the researchers said. The paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters , is the first to simulate the transformation of neutrino \"flavors\" in neutron star mergers. Neutrinos are fundamental particles that interact weakly with other matter, and come in three flavors, named for the other particles they associate with: electron, muon and tau. Under specific conditions, including the inside of a neutron star, neutrinos can theoretically change flavors, which can change the types of particles with which they interact. \"Previous simulations of binary neutron star mergers have not included the transformation of neutrino flavor,\" said Yi Qiu, graduate student in physics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and first author of the paper. \"This is partly because this process happens on a nanosecond timescale and is very difficult to capture and partly because, until recently, we didn't know enough about the theoretical physics underlying these transformations, which falls outside of the standard model of physics. In our new simulations, we found that the extent and location of neutrinos mixing and transforming impacts the matter that is ejected from the merger, the structure and composition of what remains after the merger -- the remnant -- as well as the material around it.\" The researchers built a computer simulation of a neutron star merger from the ground up, incorporating a variety of physical processes, including gravity, general relativity, hydrodynamics and the neutrino mixing. They also accounted for the transformation of electron flavor neutrinos to muon flavor, which the researchers said is the most relevant neutrino transformation in this environment. They modeled several scenarios, varying the timing and location of the mixing as well as the density of the surrounding material. The researchers found that all of these factors influenced the composition and structure of the merger remnant, including the type and quantities of elements created during the merger. During a collision, the neutrons in a neutron star can be launched at other atoms in the debris, which can capture the neutrons and ultimately decay into heavier elements, such as heavy metals like gold and platinum as well as rare earth elements that are used on Earth in smart phones, electric vehicle batteries and other devices. \"A neutrino's flavor changes how it interacts with other matter,\" said David Radice, Knerr Early Career Professor of Physics and associate professor astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and an author of the paper. \"Electron type neutrinos can take a neutron, one of the three basic parts of an atom, and transform it into the other two, a proton and electron. But muon type neutrinos cannot do this. So, the conversion of neutrino flavors can alter how many neutrons are available in the system, which directly impacts the creation of heavy metals and rare earth elements. There are still many lingering questions about the cosmic origin of these important elements, and we found that accounting for neutrino mixing could increase element production by as much as a factor of 10.\" Neutrino mixing during the merger also influenced the amount and composition of matter ejected from the merger, which the researchers said could alter the emissions detectable from Earth. These emissions typically include gravitational waves -- ripples in space time -- as well as electromagnetic radiation like X-rays or gamma rays. \"In our simulations, neutrino mixing impacted the electromagnetic emissions from neutron star mergers and possibly the gravitational waves as well,\" Radice said. \"With cutting-edge detectors like LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA and their next generation counterparts, such as the proposed Cosmic Explorer observatory that could start operations in the 2030s, astronomers are poised to detect gravitational waves more often than we have before. Better understanding how these emissions are created from neutron star mergers will help us interpret future observations.\" The researchers said modeling the mixing processes was similar to a pendulum being turned upside down. Initially, many changes occurred on an incredibly rapid timescale, but eventually the pendulum settles to a stable equilibrium. But much of this, they said, is an assumption. \"There's still a lot we don't know about the theoretical physics of these neutrino transformations,\" Qiu said. \"As theoretical particle physics continues to advance, we can greatly improve our simulations. What remains uncertain is where and how these transformations occur in neutron star mergers. Our current understanding suggests they are very likely, and our simulations show that, if they take place, they can have major effects, making it important to include them in future models and analyses.\" Now that the infrastructure for these complex simulations has been created, the researchers said they expect other groups will use the technology to continue to explore the impacts of neutrino mixing. \"Neutron star mergers function like cosmic laboratories, providing important insights into extreme physics that we can't replicate safely on Earth,\" Radice said. In addition to Qiu and Radice, the research team includes Maitraya Bhattacharyya, postdoctoral scholar in the Penn State Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos, and Sherwood Richers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

The advance could revolutionize security screening, manufacturing precision, and cancer detection. Credit: Shutterstock When German physicist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovered X-rays in the late 1800s while experimenting with cathode ray tubes, it was a breakthrough that transformed science and medicine. So much so that the basic concept remains in use today. But a team of researchers at Sandia National Laboratories believes they've found a better way, harnessing different metals and the colors of light they emit. \"It's called colorized hyperspectral X-ray imaging with multi-metal targets, or CHXI MMT for short,\" said project lead Edward Jimenez, an optical engineer. Jimenez has been working with materials scientist Noelle Collins and electronics engineer Courtney Sovinec to create X-rays of the future. \"With this new technology, we are essentially going from the old way, which is black and white, to a whole new colored world where we can better identify materials and defects of interest,\" Collins said. The team found they could achieve this using tiny, patterned samples of varied metals such as tungsten, molybdenum, gold, samarium and silver. The Basics of X-ray Creation To understand the concept, one must understand the basics of X-ray creation. Traditional X-rays are generated by bombarding a single metal target, or anode, with high-energy electrons. Those X-rays are channeled into a beam and directed at a subject or material. Denser tissues, like bone, absorb more X-rays, while less dense tissues, like muscles and organs allow more to pass through. A detector records the pattern, creating an image. While X-ray technology has advanced over time, the basic concept remains the same, which limits resolution and clarity. A New Type of X-Ray Image The Sandia team set out to solve that limitation by making the X-ray focal spot smaller. The smaller the spot, the sharper the image. They achieved this by designing an anode with metal dots patterned to be collectively smaller than the beam, effectively reducing the focal point. But the team decided they wanted to push the limits and took the concept a step further. \"We chose different metals for each dot,\" Sovinec said. \"Each metal emits a particular 'color' of X-ray light. When combined with an energy discriminating detector, we can count individual photons, which provide density information, and measure the energy of each photon. This allows us to characterize the elements of the sample.\" The result is colorized images with what the team calls revolutionary image clarity and a better understanding of an object's composition. \"We get a more accurate representation of the shape and definition of that object, which is going to allow us to make unprecedented measurements and unprecedented observations,\" Jimenez said. Far-reaching applications The team sees this as a major advancement for X-ray technology with a wide range of uses, from airport security and quality control to nondestructive testing and advanced manufacturing. They also hope its impact will improve medical diagnostics. \"With this technology, you can see even slight differences between materials,\" Jimenez said. \"We hope this will help better identify things like cancer and more effectively analyze tumor cells. In mammography you are trying to catch something before it grows. In breast tissue, it's hard to identify the different dots, but with colorization you have a sharper beam and higher resolution image that increases the system's capability to detect a microcalcification. It's really exciting to be a part of that.\" \"From here we will continue to innovate,\" Collins said. \"We hope to identify threats faster, diagnose diseases quicker and hopefully create a safer, healthier world.\" The team was recently awarded an R&D 100 award for their technology.

      "content_text": "A rare cosmic configuration: An Einstein Cross with five points of light, instead of the usual four, has been discovered by scientists. Credit: Nicol\u00e1s Lira Turpaud (ALMA Observatory) & adapted from Cox et al. 2025 When Rutgers theoretical astrophysicist Charles Keeton first saw an unusual picture shared by his colleague, he was intrigued. \"Have you ever seen an Einstein Cross with an image in the middle?\" his colleague Andrew Baker asked, referring to a rarely seen cosmic configuration. Keeton hadn't. The implications were enormous. \"I said, well, that's not supposed to happen,\" said Keeton, the Vice Provost for Experiential Learning at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. \"You can't get a fifth image in the center unless something unusual is going on with the mass that's bending the light.\" An \"Einstein Cross\" is a rarely seen cosmic configuration, in which the light from a distant galaxy is bent by the gravity of galaxies in front of it, creating four images. But the extra image in this Einstein Cross pointed to \"something unusual,\" which turned out to be a massive, hidden halo of dark matter. The existence of this invisible structure could only be inferred through careful computer modeling and analysis. The discovery, made by an international team that includes Keeton, Baker and Rutgers graduate student Lana Eid, is now being published in The Astrophysical Journal . Dark matter makes up most of the matter in the universe, but it can't be seen directly. \"We only know it's there because of how it affects the things we can see, like the way it bends light from distant galaxies,\" said Baker, a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the School of Arts and Sciences and a co-author of the study. \"This discovery gives us a rare chance to study that invisible structure in detail.\" The first step toward that discovery was taken in France. \"We were like, 'What the heck?'\" said Pierre Cox, a French astronomer, Research Director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the study's lead author, who first spotted the anomaly in data from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) of radio telescopes in the French Alps. \"It looked like a cross, and there was this image in the center,\" Cox said. \"I knew I had never seen that before.\" The team was studying a distant, dusty galaxy called HerS-3. Using NOEMA and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, they saw that the light from HerS-3 split into five rather than four images. At first, they thought it might be a glitch in the data. But the fifth image wouldn't go away. \"We tried to get rid of it,\" Cox said. \"We thought it was a problem with the instrument. But it was real.\" Computer modeling of the gravitational lens by Keeton and Eid showed that the four visible foreground galaxies causing the gravitational bending couldn't explain the details of the five-image pattern. Only with the addition of a large, invisible mass, in this case, a dark matter halo, could the model match the observations. \"We tried every reasonable configuration using just the visible galaxies, and none of them worked,\" said Keeton, also a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and a co-author of the study. \"The only way to make the math and the physics line up was to add a dark matter halo. That's the power of modeling. It helps reveal what you can't see.\" The unusual configuration doesn't just look cool: the scientists said it's scientifically valuable. The lensing effect magnifies the background galaxy, allowing astronomers to study its structure in greater detail than usual. It also offers a rare chance to learn about the dark matter that surrounds the foreground galaxies. \"This system is like a natural laboratory,\" Cox said. \"We can study both the distant galaxy and the invisible matter that's bending its light.\" Eid, a Rutgers graduate student pursuing her doctoral degree and a co-author of the study, said her involvement in the research project has been exciting from beginning to end. \"I was thrilled to join this project as a graduate student, especially since it involved a fascinating lensing system that grew more intriguing as our models evolved,\" Eid said. \"Collaborating across continents and time zones taught me the value of diverse expertise and research styles in fully understanding a new discovery.\" The team has even predicted that more features, such as outflowing gas from the galaxy, could be visible in future observations. If those predictions are confirmed, it would be a powerful validation of their models. If not, it would still teach them something new. \"This is a falsifiable prediction,\" Keeton said. \"If we look and don't see it, we'll have to go back to the drawing board. That's how science works.\" Baker said the discovery was critically enabled by both international collaboration and U.S. federal support for science. \"ALMA in Chile and the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico are supported by the National Science Foundation, and the Hubble Space Telescope is supported by NASA; all played vital roles in this work,\" he said. \"We hope they will continue to enable such discoveries well into the future.\"",

      "content_text": "Physicists have unveiled QROCODILE, a groundbreaking detector capable of probing ultralight dark matter with unprecedented precision. The results hint at unexplained signals and push science closer to solving one of its greatest mysteries. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com A new experiment called QROCODILE, led by the University of Zurich and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has achieved record sensitivity in the hunt for light dark matter. Using superconducting detectors cooled to near absolute zero, the team set world-leading limits on how dark matter interacts with ordinary matter -- opening the door to future breakthroughs in one of physics' greatest mysteries. [Hebrew University of Jerusalem]- Dark matter, the elusive substance that makes up about 85% of the universe's mass, remains one of the greatest mysteries in physics. Invisible and undetectable by ordinary means, it neither emits nor absorbs light, leaving scientists with only indirect evidence of its existence. For decades, researchers have tried in vain to catch a glimpse of these elusive particles. Now, an international collaboration of scientists has unveiled promising first results with a novel experiment called QROCODILE (Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy). The project, led jointly by the University of Zurich and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, involving also Cornell University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and MIT, has demonstrated a new path in the search for \"light\" dark matter particles. At the heart of QROCODILE is a cutting-edge superconducting detector capable of measuring incredibly faint energy deposits -- down to just 0.11 electron-volts, millions of times smaller than the energies usually detected in particle physics experiments. This sensitivity opens an entirely new frontier: testing the existence of extremely light dark matter particles, with masses thousands of times smaller than those probed by previous experiments. In a science run lasting more than 400 hours at temperatures near absolute zero, the team recorded a small number of unexplained signals. While these events cannot yet be confirmed as dark matter -- they may stem from cosmic rays or natural background radiation -- they already allow researchers to set new world-leading limits on how light dark matter particles interact with electrons and atomic nuclei An additional strength of the experiment is its potential to detect the directionality of incoming signals. Since the Earth moves through the galactic halo, dark matter particles are expected to arrive from a preferred direction. Future upgrades could allow scientists to distinguish between true dark matter signals and random background noise, a crucial step toward a definitive discovery. Prof. Yonit Hochberg of the Racah Institute of Physics at the Hebrew University, one of the project's lead scientists, explains: \"For the first time, we've placed new constraints on the existence of especially light dark matter. This is an important first step toward larger experiments that could ultimately achieve the long-sought direct detection.\" The next stage of the project, NILE QROCODILE, will further enhance the detector's sensitivity and move the experiment underground to shield it from cosmic rays. With improved shielding, larger detector arrays, and even lower energy thresholds, the researchers aim to push the boundaries of our understanding of the dark universe.",

      "content_text": "Artist\u2019s impression of a black hole star (not to scale). Mysterious tiny pinpoints of light discovered at the dawn of the universe may be giant spheres of hot gas that are so dense they look like the atmospheres of typical nuclear fusion-powered stars; however, instead of fusion, they are powered by supermassive black holes in their center that rapidly pull in matter, converting it into energy and giving off light. Credit: T. M\u00fcller/A. de Graaff/Max Planck Institute for Astronomy Tiny red objects spotted by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are offering scientists new insights into the origins of galaxies in the universe -- and may represent an entirely new class of celestial object: a black hole swallowing massive amounts of matter and spitting out light. Using the first datasets released by the telescope in 2022, an international team of scientists including Penn State researchers discovered mysterious \"little red dots.\" The researchers suggested the objects may be galaxies that were as mature as our current Milky Way, which is roughly 13.6 billion years old, just 500 to 700 million years after the Big Bang. Informally dubbed \"universe breakers\" by the team, the objects were originally thought to be galaxies far older than anyone expected in the infant universe -- calling into question what scientists previously understood about galaxy formation. Now, in a paper published on Sept. 12 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics , the international team of astronomers and physicists, including those at Penn State, suggest that the dots may not be galaxies but an entirely new type of object: a black hole star. They said their analysis indicates that the tiny pinpoints of light may be giant spheres of hot gas that are so dense they look like the atmospheres of typical nuclear fusion-powered stars; however, instead of fusion, they are powered by supermassive black holes in their center that rapidly pull in matter, converting it into energy and giving off light. \"Basically, we looked at enough red dots until we saw one that had so much atmosphere that it couldn't be explained as typical stars we'd expect from a galaxy,\" said Joel Leja, the Dr. Keiko Miwa Ross Mid-Career Associate Professor of Astrophysics at Penn State and co-author on the paper. \"It's an elegant answer really, because we thought it was a tiny galaxy full of many separate cold stars, but it's actually, effectively, one gigantic, very cold star.\" Cold stars emit little light due to their low temperatures compared to normal stars, Leja explained. Most stars in the universe are low-mass, colder stars, but they are typically harder to see as they are washed out by rarer, more luminous massive stars. Astronomers identify cold stars by their glow, which is primarily in the red optical or near-infrared spectrum, wavelengths of light that are no longer visible. While the gas around supermassive black holes is typically very hot, millions of degrees Celsius, the light from these \"red dot\" black holes was instead dominated by very cold gas, the researchers said, similar to the atmospheres of low-mass, cold stars, based on the wavelengths of light they were giving off. The most powerful telescope in space, JWST was designed to see the genesis of the cosmos with infrared-sensing instruments capable of detecting light that was emitted by the most ancient stars and galaxies. Essentially, the telescope allows scientists to see back in time roughly 13.5 billion years, near the beginning of the universe as we know it, Leja explained. From the moment the telescope turned on, researchers around the world began to spot \"little red dots,\" objects that appeared far more massive than galaxy models predicted. At first, Leja said, he and his colleagues thought the objects were mature galaxies, which tend to get redder as the stars within them age. But the objects were too bright to be explained -- the stars would need to be packed in the galaxies with impossible density. \"The night sky of such a galaxy would be dazzlingly bright,\" said Bingjie Wang, now a NASA Hubble Fellow at Princeton University who worked on the paper as a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State. \"If this interpretation holds, it implies that stars formed through extraordinary processes that have never been observed before.\" To better understand the mystery, the researchers needed spectra, a type of data that could provide information about how much light the objects emitted at different wavelengths. Between January and December 2024, the astronomers used nearly 60 hours of Webb time to obtain spectra from a total of 4,500 distant galaxies. It is one of the largest spectroscopic datasets yet obtained with the telescope. In July 2024, the team spotted an object with a spectrum that indicated a huge amount of mass, making it the most extreme case of such an early and large object. The astronomers nicknamed the object in question \"The Cliff,\" flagging it as the most promising test case to investigate just what those \"little red dots\" were. \"The extreme properties of The Cliff forced us to go back to the drawing board, and come up with entirely new models,\" said Anna de Graaff, a researcher for the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and corresponding author on the paper, in a Max Planck Institute press release. The object was so distant that its light took roughly 11.9 billion years to reach Earth. The spectra analysis of that light indicated it was actually a supermassive black hole, pulling in its surroundings at such a rate that it cocooned itself in a fiery ball of hydrogen gas. The light that Leja and his colleagues spotted was coming not from thick clusters of stars, but from one giant object. Black holes are at the center of most galaxies, Leja explained. In some cases, those black holes are millions or even billions of times more massive than our solar system's sun, pulling in nearby matter with such strength that it converts to energy and shines. \"No one's ever really known why or where these gigantic black holes at the center of galaxies come from,\" said Leja, who is also affiliated with Penn State's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. \"These black hole stars might be the first phase of formation for the black holes that we see in galaxies today -- supermassive black holes in their little infancy stage.\" He added that JWST has already found signs of high-mass black holes in the early universe. These new black hole star objects, which are essentially turbocharged mass-builders, could help explain the early evolution of the universe -- and may be a welcome addition to current models. The team is planning future work to test this hypothesis by examining the density of gas and strength of these early black hole stars, Leja said. Of course, the mysterious \"little red dots\" are great distance away in both time and space -- and their small size makes it especially challenging to get a clear picture. \"This is the best idea we have and really the first one that fits nearly all of the data, so now we need to flesh it out more,\" Leja said. \"It's okay to be wrong. The universe is much weirder than we can imagine and all we can do is follow its clues. There are still big surprises out there for us.\" A full list of authors is available in the paper. The Penn State aspects of this work were funded by NASA.",

      "content_text": "This artwork imagines the ultimate front-row seat for GW250114, a powerful collision between two black holes observed in gravitational waves by the US National Science Foundation LIGO. It depicts the view from one of the black holes as it spirals toward its cosmic partner. Ten years after LIGO's landmark detection of gravitational waves, the observatory's improved detectors allowed it to \"hear\" this celestial collision with unprecedented clarity. The gravitational-wave data enabled scientists to distinguish multiple subtle tones ringing out like a cosmic bell across the universe (imagined here as intertwining musical threads spiraling toward the center). Though only LIGO was online during GW250114, it now routinely operates as part of a network with other gravitational-wave detectors, including Europe's Virgo and Japan's KAGRA. Credit: Aurore Simonnet (SSU/EdEon)/LVK/URI On September 14, 2015, a signal arrived on Earth, carrying information about a pair of remote black holes that had spiraled together and merged. The signal had traveled about 1.3 billion years to reach us at the speed of light -- but it was not made of light. It was a different kind of signal: a quivering of space-time called gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein 100 years prior. On that day 10 years ago, the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) made the first-ever direct detection of gravitational waves. The LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced it to the world in February 2016, after six months of analysis and verification. The historic discovery meant that researchers could now sense the universe through three different means. Light waves, such as X-rays, optical, radio, and other wavelengths of light, as well as high-energy particles called cosmic rays and neutrinos had been captured before, but this was the first time researchers had witnessed a cosmic event through its gravitational warping of space-time. For this achievement, first dreamed up more than 40 years prior, three of the LIGO founders won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics: MIT's Rainer Weiss, professor of physics, emeritus (who recently passed away at age 92); Caltech's Barry Barish; and Caltech's Kip Thorne. LIGO, which consists of detectors in both Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, the Virgo detector in Italy and KAGRA in Japan operate in coordination and currently are routinely observing roughly one black hole merger every three days. Together, the gravitational-wave-hunting network, known as LVK (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA), has captured a total of more than 300 black hole mergers, most of which are already confirmed while others await further analysis. During the network's current science run, the fourth since the first run in 2015, the LVK has discovered about 230 candidate black hole mergers, more than doubling the number caught in the first three runs. The dramatic rise in the number of LVK discoveries over the past decade is owed to several improvements to their detectors -- some of which involve cutting-edge quantum precision engineering. These gravitational-wave interferometers remain by far the most precise rulers for making measurements ever created by humans. The space-time distortions induced by gravitational waves are incredibly minuscule. To sense them, LIGO and Virgo must detect changes in space-time smaller than 1/10,000 the width of a proton. That's 700 trillion times smaller than the width of a human hair. The Clearest Signal Yet The improved sensitivity of the instruments is exemplified in a recent discovery of a black hole merger referred to as GW250114 (the numbers denote the date the gravitational-wave signal arrived at Earth: January 14, 2025). The event was not that different from the first-ever detection (called GW150914) -- both involve colliding black holes about 1.3 billion light-years away with masses between 30 to 40 times that of our Sun. But thanks to 10 years of technological advances reducing instrumental noise, the GW250114 signal is dramatically clearer. \"We can hear it loud and clear, and that lets us test the fundamental laws of physics,\" says LIGO team member Katerina Chatziioannou, Caltech assistant professor of physics and William H. Hurt Scholar, and one of the leading authors of a new study on GW250114 published in the Physical Review Letters. By analyzing the frequencies of gravitational waves emitted by the merger, the LVK team was able to provide the best observational evidence captured to date for what is known as the black hole area theorem, an idea put forth by Stephen Hawking in 1971 that says the total surface areas of black holes cannot decrease. When black holes merge, their masses combine, increasing the surface area. But they also lose energy in the form of gravitational waves during the phenomenon. Additionally, the merger can cause the combined black hole to increase its spin, which leads to it having a smaller area. The black hole area theorem states that, despite these competing factors, the total surface area must grow in size. Later, Hawking and physicist Jacob Bekenstein concluded that a black hole's area is proportional to its entropy, or degree of disorder. The findings paved the way for later groundbreaking work in the field of quantum gravity, which attempts to unite two pillars of modern physics: general relativity and quantum physics. In essence, the detection (made just by LIGO, since Virgo was undergoing routine maintenance and KAGRA was offline during this particular observation) allowed the team to \"hear\" two black holes growing as they merged into one, verifying Hawking's theorem. The initial black holes had a total surface area of 240,000 square kilometers (roughly the size of United Kingdom), while the final area was about 400,000 square kilometers (almost the size of Sweden) -- a clear increase. This is the second test of the black hole area theorem; an initial test was performed in 2021 using data from the first GW150914 signal, but because that data was not as clean, the results had a confidence level of 95 percent as compared to 99.999 percent for the new data. Kip Thorne recalls Hawking phoning him to ask whether LIGO might be able to test his theorem immediately after he learned of the 2015 gravitational-wave detection. Hawking died in 2018 and sadly did not live to see his theory observationally verified. \"If Hawking were alive, he would have reveled in seeing the area of the merged black holes increase,\" Thorne says. The trickiest part of this type of analysis had to do with determining the final surface area of the merged black hole. The surface areas of pre-merger black holes can be more readily gleaned as the pair spiral together, roiling space-time and producing gravitational waves. But after the black holes merge, the signal is not as clearcut. During this so-called ringdown phase, the final black hole vibrates like a struck bell. In the new study, the researchers were able to precisely measure the details of the ringdown phase, which allowed them to calculate the mass and spin of the black hole, and subsequently determine its surface area. More precisely, they were able, for the first time, to confidently pick out two distinct gravitational-wave modes in the ringdown phase. The modes are like characteristic sounds a bell would make when struck; they have somewhat similar frequencies but die out at different rates, which makes them hard to identify. The improved data for GW250114 meant that the team could extract the modes, demonstrating that the black hole's ringdown occurred exactly as predicted by math models Another study from the LVK, submitted to Physical Review Letters today, places limits on a predicted third, higher-pitch tone in the GW250114 signal, and performs some of the most stringent tests yet of general relativity's accuracy in describing merging black holes. \"Analyzing strain data from the detectors to detect transient astrophysical signals, send out alerts to trigger follow-up observations from telescopes or publish physics results gathering information from up to hundreds of events is quite a long journey -- adds Nicolas Arnaud, CNRS researcher in France and Virgo coordinator of the fourth science run -- Out of the many skilled steps that such a complex framework requires, I see the humans behind all these data, in particular those who are on duty at any time, watching over our instruments. There are LVK scientists in all regions, pursuing a common goal: literally, the Sun never goes down above our collaborations!\" Pushing the limits LIGO and Virgo have also unveiled neutron stars over the past decade. Like black holes, neutron stars form the explosive deaths of massive stars, but they weigh less and glow with light. Of note, in August of 2017, LIGO and Virgo witnessed an epic collision between a pair of neutron stars -- a kilonova -- that sent gold and other heavy elements flying into space and drew the gaze of dozens of telescopes around the world, which captured light ranging from high-energy gamma rays to low-energy radio waves. The \"multi-messenger\" astronomy event marked the first time that both light and gravitational waves had been captured in a single cosmic event. Today, the LVK continues to alert the astronomical community to potential neutron star collisions, who then use telescopes to search the skies for signs of another kilonova. \"The global LVK network is essential to gravitational-wave astronomy,\" says Gianluca Gemme, Virgo spokesperson and director of research at INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). \"With three or more detectors operating in unison, we can pinpoint cosmic events with greater accuracy, extract richer astrophysical information, and enable rapid alerts for multi-messenger follow-up. Virgo is proud to contribute to this worldwide scientific endeavor.\" Other LVK scientific discoveries include the first detection of collisions between one neutron star and one black hole; asymmetrical mergers, in which one black hole is significantly more massive than its partner neutron star; the discovery of the lightest black holes known, challenging the idea that there is a \"mass gap\" between neutron stars and black holes; and the most massive black hole merger seen yet with a merged mass of 225 solar masses. For reference, the previous record-holder for the most massive merger had a combined mass of 140 solar masses. In the coming years, the scientists of LVK hope to further fine tune their machines, expanding their reach deeper and deeper into space. They also plan to use the knowledge they have gained to build another gravitational-wave detector, LIGO India. Looking farther into the future, scientists are working on a concept for even larger detectors.The European project, called Einstein Telescope, plans to build one or two huge underground interferometers with arms of more than 10 kilometers, The US one, called Cosmic Explorer, would be similar to the current LIGO but with arms 40 kilometers long. Observatories on this scale would allow scientists to hear the earliest black hole mergers in the universe and, possibly, the echo of the gravitational shakes of the very first moments of our universe. \"This is an amazing time for gravitational wave research: thanks to instruments such as Virgo, LIGO and KAGRA, we can explore a dark universe that was previously completely inaccessible. -- said Massimo Carpinelli, professor at University of Milano Bicocca and director of the European Gravitational Observatory in Cascina -- The scientific achievements of these 10 years are triggering a real revolution in our view of the Universe. We are already preparing a new generation of detectors such as the Einstein Telescope in Europe and Cosmic Explorer in the US, as well as the LISA space interferometer, which will take us even further into space and back in time. In the coming years, we will certainly be able to tackle these extraordinary challenges thanks to increasingly broad and solid cooperation between scientists, different countries and institutions, both at European and global level.\"",

      "content_text": "Exploding primordial black holes could soon be detected, with researchers predicting up to a 90% chance in the next 10 years. If seen, these rare events could unlock the universe\u2019s hidden particles and confirm long-sought theories. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com Physicists have long believed that black holes explode at the end of their lives, and that such explosions happen -- at most -- only once every 100,000 years. But new research published in Physical Review Letters by physicists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has found a more than 90% probability that one of these black-hole explosions might be seen within the decade, and that, if we are prepared, our current fleet of space and earthbound telescopes could witness the event. Such an explosion would be strong evidence of a theorized but never observed kind of black hole, called a \"primordial black hole,\" that could have formed less than a second after the Big Bang occurred, 13.8 billion years ago. Furthermore, the explosion would give us a definitive catalog of all the subatomic particles in existence, including the ones we have observed, such as electrons, quarks and Higgs bosons, the ones that we have only hypothesized, like dark matter particles, as well as everything else that is, so far, entirely unknown to science. This catalog would finally answer one of humankind's oldest questions: from where did everything in existence come? We know that black holes exist, and we have a good understanding of their life cycle: an old, large star runs out of fuel, implodes in a massively powerful supernova and leaves behind an area of spacetime with such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape. These black holes are incredibly heavy and are essentially stable. But, as physicist Stephen Hawking pointed out in 1970, another kind of black hole -- a primordial black hole (PBH), could be created not by the collapse of a star but from the universe's primordial conditions shortly after the Big Bang. PBHs, like the standard black holes, are so massively dense that almost nothing can escape them -- which is what makes them \"black.\" However, despite their density, PBHs could be much lighter than the black holes we have so far observed. Furthermore, Hawking also showed that black holes have a temperature and could, in theory, slowly emit particles via what is now known as \"Hawking radiation\" if they got hot enough. \"The lighter a black hole is, the hotter it should be and the more particles it will emit. As PBHs evaporate, they become ever lighter, and so hotter, emitting even more radiation in a runaway process until explosion. It's that Hawking radiation that our telescopes can detect,\" says Andrea Thamm, co-author and assistant professor of physics at UMass Amherst. Yet, while we should be able to, no one has ever directly observed a PBH. \"We know how to observe this Hawking radiation,\" says Joaquim Iguaz Juan, a postdoctoral researcher in physics at UMass Amherst. \"We can see it with our current crop of telescopes, and because the only black holes that can explode today or in the near future are these PBHs, we know that if we see Hawking radiation, we are seeing an exploding PBH.\" Though physicists since Hawking's time have thought that the chances of seeing an exploding PBH are infinitesimally slight, Iguaz Juan notes that \"our job as physicists is to question the received assumptions, to ask better questions and come up with more precise hypotheses.\" The team's new hypothesis? Get ready now to see the explosion. \"We believe that there is up to a 90% chance of witnessing an exploding PBH in the next 10 years,\" says Aidan Symons, one of the paper's co-authors and a graduate student in physics at UMass Amherst. In its work, the team explores a \"dark-QED toy model.\" This is essentially a copy of the usual electric force as we know it, but which includes a very heavy, hypothesized version of the electron, which the team calls a \"dark electron.\" The team then reconsidered long-held assumptions about the electrical charge of black holes. Standard black holes have no charge, and it was assumed that PBHs are likewise electrically neutral. \"We make a different assumption,\" says Michael Baker, co-author and an assistant professor of physics at UMass Amherst. \"We show that if a primordial black hole is formed with a small dark electric charge, then the toy model predicts that it should be temporarily stabilized before finally exploding.\" Taking all known experimental data into account, they find that we could then potentially observe a PBH explosion not once every 100,000 years as previously thought, but once every 10 years. \"We're not claiming that it's absolutely going to happen this decade,\" says Baker, \"but there could be a 90% chance that it does. Since we already have the technology to observe these explosions, we should be ready.\" Iguaz Juan adds, \"this would be the first-ever direct observation of both Hawking radiation and a PBH. We would also get a definitive record of every particle that makes up everything in the universe. It would completely revolutionize physics and help us rewrite the history of the universe.\"",

      "content_text": "A glimpse into how hidden geometry shapes the motion of electrons in quantum materials. Electrons flowing upstream feel an extra resistance that reveals the quantum metric. Credit: \u00a9 Xavier Ravinet \u2013 UNIG How can data be processed at lightning speed, or electricity conducted without loss? To achieve this, scientists and industry alike are turning to quantum materials, governed by the laws of the infinitesimal. Designing such materials requires a detailed understanding of atomic phenomena, much of which remains unexplored. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), has taken a major step forward by uncovering a hidden geometry -- until now purely theoretical -- that distorts the trajectories of electrons in much the same way gravity bends the path of light. This work, published in Science , opens new avenues for quantum electronics. Future technologies depend on high-performance materials with unprecedented properties, rooted in quantum physics. At the heart of this revolution lies the study of matter at the microscopic scale -- the very essence of quantum physics. In the past century, exploring atoms, electrons and photons within materials gave rise to transistors and, ultimately, to modern computing. New quantum phenomena that defy established models are still being discovered today. Recent studies suggest the possible emergence of a geometry within certain materials when vast numbers of particles are observed. This geometry appears to distort the trajectories of electrons in these materials -- much like Einstein's gravity bends the path of light. From theory to observation Known as quantum metric, this geometry reflects the curvature of the quantum space in which electrons move. It plays a crucial role in many phenomena at the microscopic scale of matter. Yet detecting its presence and effects remains a major challenge. ''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science. Thanks to recent work, the team led by the UNIGE researcher, in collaboration with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, has detected quantum metric at the interface between two oxides -- strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate -- a well-known quantum material. ''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study. Unlocking Future Technologies Observing this phenomenon makes it possible to characterise a material's optical, electronic and transport properties with greater precision. The research team also demonstrates that quantum metric is an intrinsic property of many materials -- contrary to previous assumptions. ''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.",

      "content_text": "Figure 1. Illustration of the Tunable Metafiber concept. Credit: Sun, J., Huang, W., Lorenz, A. et al. Precise control of light focus is essential for applications ranging from microscopy and laser surgery to quantum optics and telecommunications. However, existing solutions often rely on large, complex external components that limit integration and speed. In a new study published in Light: Science & Applications , researchers led by Professor Markus A. Schmidt from the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology and Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany have introduced a novel solution: the tunable Metafiber. This fully fiber-integrated device uses a 3D nanoprinted phase-only hologram directly on the end face of a dual-core fiber to achieve remote focus control by simply adjusting the relative power between the fiber's guided modes. The hologram is designed to be sensitive to changes in the interference pattern of the light emitted from each core, enabling a shift in the focal spot's position without the need for any moving parts. Experimental results confirm that precise and continuous focus modulation of over 3 microns can be achieved while maintaining high beam quality. This new approach allows for compact, robust, and fast tunable focusing using optical fibers, significantly advancing the field of reconfigurable photonics. Potential applications include high-speed optical trapping, integrated endoscopic tools for minimally invasive diagnostics or surgery, and improved signal routing in fiber communication systems. The Metafiber's tunability arises entirely from power modulation -- a method much faster than traditional mechanical or liquid-crystal-based approaches -- and is compatible with existing fiber systems. This makes it ideal for rapid implementation in both research and industrial applications. The study marks a milestone in on-fiber photonic integration and opens exciting avenues for developing next-generation fiber-based optical systems. An illustrative image of the power-controlled, fully fiber-integrated spatial focusing using a phase-only 3D nanoprinted hologram coupled to a single-mode dual-core fiber is shown in Fig. 1. To illustrate the functional principle, two focusing light beams related to two relative power differences of the guided modes (green and red) are shown by the yellow and red magenta areas (dashed dark blue line: central fiber axis). The middle left inset shows an example of the intensity distribution of the interfered Gaussian beams in the hologram plane when the power in the modes is equal. The top right (scale bar: 20\u00b5m) and center (scale bar: 100\u00b5m) insets show images of the nanoprinted 3D hologram and the expansion section on the end face of the dual-core fiber, respectively. The bottom inset shows the spatial focus tuning with a total focus shift of more than 3 \u00b5m by adjusting the relative power difference of the two fiber cores.",

      "content_text": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a large liquid scintillator neutrino experiment whose main goal is to act as a multipurpose observatory for neutrinos produced by artificial and natural sources. Credit: JUNO Collaboration The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) has successfully completed filling its 20,000-tons liquid scintillator detector and begun data taking on Aug. 26. After more than a decade of preparation and construction, JUNO is the first of a new generation of very large neutrino experiments to reach this stage. Initial trial operation and data taking show that key performance indicators met or exceeded design expectations, enabling JUNO to tackle one of this decade's major open questions in particle physics: the ordering of neutrino masses -- whether the third mass state (\u03bd\u2083) is heavier than the second (\u03bd2). Prof. Yifang Wang, a researcher at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and JUNO spokesperson, said: \"Completing the filling of the JUNO detector and starting data taking marks a historic milestone. For the first time, we have in operation a detector of this scale and precision dedicated to neutrinos. JUNO will allow us to answer fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the universe.\" Located 700 meters underground near Jiangmen city in the Guangdong Province, JUNO detects antineutrinos produced 53 kilometers away by the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants and measures their energy spectrum with record precision. Unlike other approaches, JUNO's determination of the mass ordering is independent of matter effects in the Earth and largely free of parameter degeneracies. JUNO will also deliver order-of-magnitude improvements in the precision of several neutrino-oscillation parameters and enable cutting-edge studies of neutrinos from the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and the Earth. It will also open new windows to explore unknown physics, including searches for sterile neutrinos and proton decay. Proposed in 2008 and approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangdong Province in 2013, JUNO began underground construction in 2015. Detector installation started in December 2021 and was completed in December 2024, followed by a phased filling campaign. Within 45 days, the team filled 60,000 tons of ultra-pure water, keeping the liquid-level difference between the inner and outer acrylic spheres within centimeters and maintaining a flow-rate uncertainty below 0.5%, safeguarding structural integrity. Over the next six months, 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator were filled into the 35.4-meter-diameter acrylic sphere while displacing the water. Throughout, stringent requirements on ultra-high purity, optical transparency, and extremely low radioactivity were achieved. In parallel, the collaboration conducted detector debugging, commissioning, and optimization, enabling a seamless transition to full operations at the completion of filling. At the heart of JUNO is a central liquid-scintillator detector with an unprecedentedly large effective mass of 20,000 tons, housed at the center of a 44-meter-deep water pool. A 41.1-meter-diameter stainless steel truss supports the 35.4-meter acrylic sphere, the scintillator, 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 25,600 3-inch PMTs, front-end electronics, cabling, anti-magnetic compensation coils, and optical panels. All PMTs operate simultaneously to capture scintillation light from neutrino interactions and convert it to electrical signals. Prof. MA Xiaoyan, JUNO Chief Engineer, remarked: \"Building JUNO has been a journey of extraordinary challenges. It demanded not only new ideas and technologies, but also years of careful planning, testing, and perseverance. Meeting the stringent requirements of purity, stability, and safety called for the dedication of hundreds of engineers and technicians. Their teamwork and integrity turned a bold design into a functioning detector, ready now to open a new window on the neutrino world.\" JUNO is hosted by the IHEP and involves more than 700 researchers from 74 institutions across 17 countries and regions. \"The landmark achievement that we announce today is also a result of the fruitful international cooperation ensured by many research groups outside China, bringing to JUNO their expertise from previous liquid scintillator set-ups. The worldwide liquid scintillator community has pushed the technology to its ultimate frontier, opening the path towards the ambitious physics goals of the experiment,\" commented Prof. Gioacchino Ranucci, Deputy spokesperson of JUNO and a Professor at the University of Milano and INFN-Milano. JUNO is designed for a scientific lifetime of up to 30 years, with a credible upgrade path toward a world-leading search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Such an upgrade would probe the absolute neutrino mass scale and test whether neutrinos are Majorana particles, addressing fundamental questions spanning particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, and profoundly shaping our understanding of the universe.",

      "content_text": "Rhagovelia water strider showing fans. Credit: Victor Ortega-Jimenez/UC Berkeley A collaborative team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Ajou University in South Koreahas revealed that the unique fan-like propellers of Rhagovelia water striders -- which allow them to glide across fast-moving streams -- open and close passively, like a paintbrush, ten times faster than the blink of an eye. Inspired by this biological innovation, the team developed a revolutionary insect-scale robot that incorporates engineered self-morphing fans that mimic the agile movements of Rhagovelia bugs. This study highlights how form and function of a biological adaptation shaped by natural selection, can enhance the locomotion and endurance of both water striders and bioengineered robots without incurring additional energy costs. An automatic fan enhances interfacial motion Rhagovelia water striders are unique among water striders because these millimeter-sized semiaquatic insects use specialized fan-like structures on their propulsion legs that enable rapid turns and bursts of speed. \"I was intrigued the first time I saw ripple bugs while working as a postdoc at Kennesaw State University during the pandemic.\" said Victor Ortega-Jimenez an integrative biologist now at the University of California, Berkeley, a lead author of the study. Ortega-Jimenez had previously studied the jumping performance of large Gerridae water striders from unsteady waters, but Rhahovelia bugs were different. \"These tiny insects were skimming and turning so rapidly across the surface of turbulent streams that they resembled flying insects. How do they do it? That question stayed with me and took more than five years of incredible collaborative work to answer it.\" Until now it was believed that these fans were powered solely by muscle action. However, a study published on August 21\u00a0in Science , reports that Rhagovelia's flat, ribbon-shaped fans can instead passively morph using surface tension and elastic forces, without relying on muscle energy. \"Observing for the first time an isolated fan passively expanding almost instantaneously upon contact with a water droplet was entirely unexpected,\" said Dr. Ortega-Jimenez. This remarkable combination of collapsibility during leg recovery and rigidity during propulsion allows the bugs to execute sharp turns in just 50 milliseconds and move at speeds up to 120 body lengths per second, rivaling the rapid aerial maneuvers of flying flies. Collaboration is key When Dr. Ortega-Jimenez joined Georgia Tech in 2020 after leaving KSU, he presented the project and preliminary observations on Rhagovelia bugs to Dr. Saad Bhamla, who became fascinated and eager to explore it further. It was Dr. Bhamla who brought Dr. Je-Sung's group into the collaboration, opening new possibilities to integrate biology, physics, and robotics into the project. \"I saw a real discovery hiding in plain sight. Often, we think science is a lone genius sport, but this couldn't be farther from the truth. Modern science is all about interdisciplinary team of curious scientists working together, across borders and disciplines to study nature and engineer new bioinspired machines\" Said Dr Bhamla This interdisciplinary effort, integrating experimental biology, fluid physics, and engineering design, continued for more than five years. Rhagobot is born: The next generation of water strider robots Creating an insect-size robot inspired by ripple bugs was a major challenge, particularly because the microstructural design of the fan remained a mystery. The breakthrough came when Dr. Dongjin Kim and Professor Je-Sung from Ajou University captured high-resolution images of the fan using a scanning electron microscope, that they were able to uncover the solution to this puzzle. \"We initially designed various types of cylindrical-shaped fans, which we generally think what hair looks like. However, the functional duality of the fan -- rigidity for thrust generation and flexible for collapsibility -- could not be achieved with cylindrical structures. After numerous attempts, we overcame this challenge by designing a flat-ribbon shaped fan. We strongly suspected that biological fans might share a similar morphology, and eventually discovered that the Rhagovelia fan indeed possess a flat-ribbon micro architecture, which had not been previously reported. This discovery further validated the design principle behind our artificial flat-ribbon fan.\" said Dr Dongjin Kim, a postdoctoral researcher at Ajou University and also a lead author of this study. With these insights they were able to decode the structural basis and function of this natural propulsion system and recreate it in a robotic form. The result was the engineering of a one milligram elastocapillary fan that deploys itself, which was integrated into an insect-size robot. This microrobot is capable of enhanced thrust, braking, and maneuverability, validated through experiments involving both live insects and robotic prototypes. \"Our robotic fans self-morph using nothing but water surface forces and flexible geometry -- just like their biological counterparts. It is a form of mechanical embedded intelligence refined by nature through millions of years of evolution. In small-scale robotics, these kinds of efficient and unique mechanisms would be a key enabling technology for overcoming limits in miniaturization of conventional robots.\" said Professor Je-sung Koh, a senior author of the study. The study not only establishes a direct link between fan microstructure and aquatic locomotion control, but also lays the foundation for future design of compact, semi-aquatic robots that can explore water surfaces in challenging, fast-flowing environments. The ripple bug's fan structure, which rapidly collapses and reopens as it enters and exits water, has revealed an unprecedented biomechanical duality -- high flexibility for rapid deployment and high rigidity for thrust. This duality addresses longstanding limitations in small-scale aquatic robotics, such as inefficient stroke recovery and limited maneuvering capacity. Sketching vortices and waves on water It is well known that during propulsion, non-fanned water striders (e.g., those of the Gerridae family) generate characteristic dipolar vortices and capillary waves when stroking their superhydrophobic legs on the water. In contrast, fanned Rhagovelia bugs produce a distinct and complex vortical signature with each stroke, closely resembling the wake produced by flapping wings in air. \"It's as if Rhagovelia have tiny wings attached to their legs, like the Greek god Hermes,\" said Dr. Ortega-Jimenez. \"Future research is needed to determine whether ripple bugs can similarly produce lift-based thrust with their fan-like structures, in addition to drag-based propulsion.\" This possibility is intriguing, because evidence suggests that whirligig beetles and cormorants generate hydrodynamic lift for swimming propulsion via their hairy legs and webbed feet, respectively. In addition to these vortices, Rhagovelia bugs also produce symmetrical capillary waves during leg propulsion, which appear to aid in thrust generation, along with strong bow waves that form at the front of the body. Standing against turbulent waters Natural streams pose a real challenge, especially for tiny animals that live and move at the interface. Ripple bugs, roughly the size of a grain of rice, must navigate highly dynamic, wavy, and turbulent waters, while escaping predators, catching prey and finding mates. The relative levels of turbulence that these insects endure daily far exceed what we typically experience during airplane turbulence. Surprisingly, twenty-four-hour monitoring of these bugs in the lab revealed their remarkable endurance. \"They literally row day and night throughout their lifespan, only pausing to molt, mate, or feed,\" said Ortega-Jimenez. These unsteady conditions found in streams represent also a significant difficulty for designing interfacial micro-robots capable of moving effectively across such unpredictable waters. \"When designing small-scale robots, it's important to account for the specific environment in which they will operate -- in this case, the water's surface. By leveraging the unique properties of that environment, a robot's performance and efficiency can be greatly enhanced. The Rhagobot, for instance, can travel quickly along a flowing stream thanks to its intelligent fan structure, which is powered by surface tension and the drag forces from the water surface.\" said Jesung Koh. Finally, these discoveries can have wide-ranging implications for bioinspired robotics, particularly in the development of environmental monitoring systems, search-and-rescue microrobots, and devices capable of navigating perturbed water-air interfaces with insect-like dexterity.",

      "content_text": "Quantum Cryptography with quantum dot based compact and high rate single photon nano-devices. Credit: Lars Luder Physicists have developed a breakthrough concept in quantum encryption that makes private communication more secure over significantly longer distances, surpassing state-of-the-art technologies. For decades, experts believed such a technology upgrade required perfect optical hardware, namely, light sources that strictly emit one light particle (photon) at a time -- something extremely difficult and expensive to build. But the new approach uses innovative encryption protocols applied to tiny, engineered materials called quantum dots to send encrypted information securely, even with imperfect light sources. Real-world tests show it can outperform even the best of current systems, potentially bringing quantum-safe communication closer to everyday use. A team of physicists has made a breakthrough that could bring secure quantum communication closer to everyday use -- without needing flawless hardware. The research, led by PhD students Yuval Bloom and Yoad Ordan, under the guidance of Professor Ronen Rapaport from theRacah Institute of Physics at Hebrew University in collaboration with researchers from Los-Alamos National Labs, and published in PRX Quantum , introduces a new practical approach that significantly improve how we send quantum encrypted information using light particles -- even when using imperfect equipment. Cracking a 40-Year-Old Challenge in Quantum Communication For four decades, the holy grail of quantum key distribution (QKD) -- the science of creating unbreakable encryption using quantum mechanics -- has hinged on one elusive requirement: perfectly engineered single-photon sources. These are tiny light sources that can emit one particle of light (photon) at a time. But in practice, building such devices with absolute precision has proven extremely difficult and expensive. To work around that, the field has relied heavily on lasers, which are easier to produce but not ideal. These lasers send faint pulses of light that contain a small, but unpredictable, number of photons -- a compromise that limits both security and the distance over which data can be safely transmitted, as a smart eavesdropper can \"steal\" the information bits that are encoded simultaneously on more than one photon. A Better Way with Imperfect Tools Bloom, Ordan, and their team flipped the script. Instead of waiting for perfect photon sources, they developed two new protocols that work with what we have now -- sub-Poissonian photon sources based on quantum dots, which are tiny semiconductor particles that behave like artificial atoms. By dynamically engineering the optical behavior of these quantum dots and pairing them with nanoantennas, the team was able to tweak how the photons are emitted. This fine-tuning allowed them to suggest and demonstrate two advanced encryption strategies: A truncated decoy state protocol : A new version of a widely used quantum encryption approach, tailored for imperfect single photon sources, that weeds out potential hacking attempts due to multi-photon events. A heralded purification protocol : A new method that dramatically improves signal security by \"filtering\" the excess photons in real time, ensuring that only true single photon bits are recorded. In simulations and lab experiments, these techniques outperformed even the best versions of traditional laser-based QKD methods -- extending the distance over which a secure key can be exchanged by more than 3 decibels , a substantial leap in the field. A Real-World Test and a Step Toward Practical Quantum Networks To prove it wasn't just theory, the team built a real-world quantum communication setup using a room-temperature quantum dot source. They ran their new reinforced version of the well-known BB84 encryption protocol -- the backbone of many quantum key distribution systems -- and showed that their approach was not only feasible but superior to existing technologies. What's more, their approach is compatible with a wide range of quantum light sources, potentially lowering the cost and technical barriers to deploying quantum-secure communication on a large scale. \"This is a significant step toward practical, accessible quantum encryption,\" said Professor Rapaport. \"It shows that we don't need perfect hardware to get exceptional performance -- we just need to be smarter about how we use what we have.\" Co-Lead author Yuval Bloom added, \"We hope this work helps open the door to real-world quantum networks that are both secure and affordable. The cool thing is that we don't have to wait, it can be implemented with what we already have in many labs world-wide\"",

      "content_text": "ATLAS researchers have found evidence of the Higgs boson transforming into muons and refined their search for other rare decays, pushing the limits of what we know about this mysterious particle. Credit: Shutterstock The ATLAS Collaboration finds evidence of Higgs-boson decays to muons and improves sensitivity to Higgs-boson decays to a Z boson and a photon. Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, physicists have made major strides in exploring its properties. Does that mean the subject is done and dusted? Far from it! In new results presented at the 2025 European Physical Society Conference on High Energy Physics (EPS-HEP), the ATLAS Collaboration narrowed in on two exceptionally rare Higgs-boson decays using data collected in Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These studies offer deep insights into how closely the Higgs boson's behaviour aligns with the Standard Model. The first process under study was the Higgs-boson decay into a pair of muons (H\u2192\u03bc\u03bc). Despite its scarceness - occurring in just 1 out of every 5000 Higgs decays - this process provides the best opportunity to study the Higgs interaction with second-generation fermions and shed light on the origin of mass across different generations. The second investigated process was the Higgs-boson decay into a Z boson and a photon (H\u2192Z\u03b3), where the Z boson subsequently decays into electron or muon pairs. This rare decay is especially intriguing, as it proceeds via an intermediate \"loop\" of virtual particles. If new particles contribute to this loop, the process could offer hints of physics beyond the Standard Model. Looking for needles in a haystack Identifying these rare decays is quite the challenge. For H\u2192\u03bc\u03bc, researchers looked for a small excess of events clustering near a muon-pair mass of 125 GeV (the mass of the Higgs boson). This signal can be easily hidden behind the thousands of muon pairs produced through other processes (\"background\"). The H\u2192Z\u03b3 decay is even harder to isolate, as the chances of spotting its signal are complicated by the fact that the Z boson only decays into detectable leptons about 6% of the time. Compounding the challenge are the operation conditions of LHC Run 3, which features more overlapping collisions, making it easier for particle jets to mimic real photons. To boost the sensitivity of their searches, ATLAS physicists combined the first three years of Run-3 data (165 fb -1 , collected between 2022-2024) with the full Run-2 dataset (140 fb -1 , from 2015-2018). They also developed a sophisticated method to better model background processes, categorised recorded events by the specific Higgs-production modes, and made further improvements to their event-selection techniques in order to maximize the likelihood of spotting genuine signals. Finding evidence and enhancing sensitivity In the previous search for H\u2192\u03bc\u03bc using the full Run-2 dataset, the ATLAS Collaboration saw its first hint of this process at the level of 2 standard deviations. The comparable CMS result reached an observed (expected) significance of 3 (2.5) standard deviations. Now, with the combined Run-2 and Run-3 datasets, the ATLAS Collaboration has found evidence for H\u2192\u03bc\u03bc with an observed (expected) significance over the background-only hypothesis of 3.4 (2.5) standard deviations. This means that the chance that the result is a statistical fluctuation is less than one in 3000! As for the H\u2192Z\u03b3 process, a previous ATLAS and CMS combined analysis used Run-2 data to find evidence of this decay mode. It reported an observed (expected) excess over the background-only hypothesis of 3.4 (1.6) standard deviations. The latest ATLAS result, combining Run-2 and Run-3 data, reported an observed (expected) excess over the background-only hypothesis of 2.5 (1.9) standard deviations. This outcome provides the most stringent expected sensitivity to date for measuring the decay probability (\"branching fraction\") of H\u2192Z\u03b3. These achievements were made possible by the large, excellent dataset provided by the LHC, the outstanding efficiency and performance of the ATLAS experiment, and the use of novel analysis techniques. With more data on the horizon, the journey of exploration continues!",

      "content_text": "Complex computational methods could solve cosmic mysteries. Credit: Gabriel Fitzpatrick for FQxI, \u00a9 FQxI (2025) We're often told it is \"unscientific\" or \"meaningless\" to ask what happened before the Big Bang. But a new paper by FQxI cosmologist Eugene Lim, of King's College London, UK, and astrophysicists Katy Clough, of Queen Mary University of London, UK, and Josu Aurrekoetxea, at Oxford University, UK, published in Living Reviews in Relativity , in June 2025, proposes a way forward: using complex computer simulations to numerically (rather than exactly) solve Einstein's equations for gravity in extreme situations. The team argues that numerical relativity should be applied increasingly in cosmology to probe some of the universe's biggest questions-including what happened before the Big Bang, whether we live in a multiverse, if our universe has collided with a neighboring cosmos, or whether our universe cycled through a series of bangs and crunches. Einstein's equations of general relativity describe gravity and the motion of cosmic objects. But wind the clock back far enough and you'll typically encounter a singularity-a state of infinite density and temperature-where the laws of physics collapse. Cosmologists simply cannot solve Einstein's equations in such extreme environments-their normal simplifying assumptions no longer hold. And the same impasse applies to objects involving singularities or extreme gravity, such as black holes. One issue might be what cosmologists take for granted. They normally assume that the universe is 'isotropic' and 'homogeneous'-looking the same in every direction to every observer. This is a very good approximation for the universe we see around us, and one that makes it possible to easily solve Einstein's equations in most cosmic scenarios. But is this a good approximation for the universe during the Big Bang? \"You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations,\" explains Lim. \"Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost.\" Beyond the Lamppost Numerical relativity was first suggested in the 1960s and 1970s to try to work out what kinds of gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric of spacetime) would be emitted if black holes collided and merged. This is an extreme scenario for which it is impossible to solve Einstein's equations with paper and pen alone-sophisticated computer code and numerical approximations are required. Its development received renewed focus when the LIGO experiment was proposed in the 80s, although the problem was only solved in this way in 2005, raising hopes that the method could also be successfully applied to other puzzles. \"You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations. Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost,\" says Eugene Lim. One longstanding puzzle that Lim is particularly excited about is cosmic inflation, a period of extremely rapid expansion in the early universe. Inflation was initially proposed to explain why the universe looks the way it does today, stretching out an initially small patch, so that the universe looks similar across a vast expanse. \"If you don't have inflation, a lot of things fall apart,\" explains Lim. But while inflation helps explain the state of the universe today, nobody has been able to explain how or why the baby universe had this sudden short-lived growth spurt. The trouble is, to probe this using Einstein's equations, cosmologists have to assume that the universe was homogeneous and isotropic in the first place-something which inflation was meant to explain. If you instead assume it started out in another state, then \"you don't have the symmetry to write down your equations easily,\" explains Lim. But numerical relativity could help us get around this problem-allowing radically different starting conditions. It isn't a simple puzzle to solve, though, as there's an infinite number of ways spacetime could have been before inflation. Lim is therefore hoping to use numerical relativity to test the predictions coming from more fundamental theories that generate inflation, such as string theory. Cosmic Strings, Colliding Universes There are other exciting prospects, too. Physicists could use numerical relativity to try to work out what kind of gravitational waves could be generated by hypothetical objects called cosmic strings-long, thin \"scars\" in spacetime-potentially helping to confirm their existence. They might also be able to predict signatures, or \"bruises,\" on the sky from our universe colliding with neighboring universes (if they even exist), which could help us verify the multiverse theory. Excitingly, numerical relativity could also help reveal whether there was a universe before the Big Bang. Perhaps the cosmos is cyclic and goes though \"bounces\" from old universes into new ones-experiencing repeated rebirths, Big Bangs and big crunches. That's a very hard problem to solve analytically. \"Bouncing universes are an excellent example, because they reach strong gravity where you can't rely on your symmetries,\" says Lim. \"Several groups are already working on them-it used to be that nobody was.\" Numerical relativity simulations are so complex that they require supercomputers to run. As the technology of these machines improves, we might expect significant improvement in our understanding of the universe. Lim is hoping the team's new paper, which outlines the methods and benefits of numerical relativity, can ultimately help get researchers across different areas up to speed. \"We hope to actually develop that overlap between cosmology and numerical relativity so that numerical relativists who are interested in using their techniques to explore cosmological problems can go ahead and do it,\" Lim says, adding, \"and cosmologists who are interested in solving some of the questions they cannot solve, can use numerical relativity.\"",

      "content_text": "Active flat bands in kagome superconductors have been experimentally proven, opening the door to engineering powerful new quantum materials for future electronics. Credit: AI/ScienceDaily.com Researchers at Rice University and collaborating institutions have discovered direct evidence of active flat electronic bands in a kagome superconductor. This breakthrough could pave the way for new methods to design quantum materials -- including superconductors, topological insulators and spin-based electronics -- that could power future electronics and computing technologies. The study, published in Nature Communications Aug. 14, centers on the chromium-based kagome metal CsCr\u2083Sb\u2085, which becomes superconducting under pressure. Kagome metals, characterized by their two-dimensional lattices of corner-sharing triangles, have recently been predicted to host compact molecular orbitals, or standing-wave patterns of electrons that could potentially facilitate unconventional superconductivity and novel magnetic orders that can be made active by electron correlation effects. In most materials, these flat bands remain too far from active energy levels to have any significant impact; however, in CsCr\u2083Sb\u2085, they are actively involved and directly influence the material's properties. Pengcheng Dai, Ming Yi and Qimiao Si of Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy and Smalley-Curl Institute, along with Di-Jing Huang of Taiwan's National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, led the study. \"Our results confirm a surprising theoretical prediction and establish a pathway for engineering exotic superconductivity through chemical and structural control,\" said Dai, the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy. The finding provides experimental proof for ideas that had only existed in theoretical models. It also shows how the intricate geometry of kagome lattices can be used as a design tool for controlling the behavior of electrons in solids. \"By identifying active flat bands, we've demonstrated a direct connection between lattice geometry and emergent quantum states,\" said Yi, an associate professor of physics and astronomy. The research team employed two advanced synchrotron techniques alongside theoretical modeling to investigate the presence of active standing-wave electron modes. They used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to map electrons emitted under synchrotron light, revealing distinct signatures associated with compact molecular orbitals. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measured magnetic excitations linked to these electronic modes. \"The ARPES and RIXS results of our collaborative team give a consistent picture that flat bands here are not passive spectators but active participants in shaping the magnetic and electronic landscape,\" said Si, the Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Professor of Physics and Astronomy, \"This is amazing to see given that, until now, we were only able to see such features in abstract theoretical models.\" Theoretical support was provided by analyzing the effect of strong correlations starting from a custom-built electronic lattice model, which replicated the observed features and guided the interpretation of results. Fang Xie, a Rice Academy Junior Fellow and co-first author, led that portion of the study. Obtaining such precise data required unusually large and pure crystals of CsCr\u2083Sb\u2085, synthesized using a refined method that produced samples 100 times larger than previous efforts, said Zehao Wang, a Rice graduate student and co-first author. The work underscores the potential of interdisciplinary research across fields of study, said Yucheng Guo, a Rice graduate student and co-first author who led the ARPES work. \"This work was possible due to the collaboration that consisted of materials design, synthesis, electron and magnetic spectroscopy characterization and theory,\" Guo said.

      "content_text": "Scientists finally solved a century-old quantum puzzle, paving the way for revolutionary precision technologies. Credit: Shutterstock A plucked guitar string can vibrate for seconds before falling silent. A playground swing, emptied of its passenger, will gradually come to rest. These are what physicists call \"damped harmonic oscillators\" and are well understood in terms of Newton's laws of motion. But in the tiny world of atoms, things are strange -- and operate under the bizarre laws of quantum physics. University of Vermont professor Dennis Clougherty and his student Nam Dinh wondered if there are systems in the atomic world that behave like the vibrating motion of a guitar string in the Newtonian world. \"If so, can we construct a quantum theory of the damped harmonic oscillator?\" Clougherty wondered. In a study published on July 7, 2025, in the journal Physical Review Research , he and Dinh did just that: found an exact solution to a model that behaves as a \"damped quantum harmonic oscillator,\" they write -- a guitar-string type of motion at the scale of atoms. It turns out that for roughly 90 years, theorists have tried to describe these damped harmonic systems using quantum physics -- but with limited success. \"The difficulty involves preserving Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a foundational tenet of quantum physics,\" says Clougherty, a professor of physics at UVM since 1992. Unlike the human-scale world of, say, bouncing balls or arcing rockets, the famed Heisenberg uncertainty principle shows that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which the position and momentum of a particle can be known simultaneously. At the scale of an atom, the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other can be known. Lamb Chopped The model studied by the UVM physicists was originally constructed by British physicist Horace Lamb in 1900, before Werner Heisenberg was born, and well before the development of quantum physics. Lamb was interested in describing how a vibrating particle in a solid could lose energy to the solid. Using Newton's laws of motion, Lamb showed that elastic waves created by the particle's motion feed back on the particle itself and cause it to damp -- that is, to vibrate with less and less energy over time. \"In classical physics, it is known that when objects vibrate or oscillate, they lose energy due to friction, air resistance, and so on,\" says Dinh. \"But this is not so obvious in the quantum regime.\" Clougherty and Dinh (who graduated from UVM in 2024 with a BS in physics, in 2025 with a master's degree, and is now pursuing a PhD in mathematics at UVM) -- with support from the National Science Foundation and NASA -- reformulated Lamb's model for the quantum world and found its solution. \"To preserve the uncertainty principle, it is necessary to include in detail the interaction of the atom with all the other atoms in the solid,\" Clougherty explains, \"it's a so-called many-body problem.\" Tiny Tools? How did they solve this problem? Hold onto your seat. \"Through a multimode Bogoliubov transformation, which diagonalizes the Hamiltonian of the system and allows for the determination of its properties,\" they write, yielding a state called a \"multimode squeezed vacuum.\" If you missed a bit of that, suffice it to say that the UVM researchers were able to mathematically reformulate Lamb's system so that an atom's oscillating behavior could be fully described in precise terms. And precisely locating the position of one atom could lead to something like the world's tiniest tape measure: new methods for measuring quantum distances and other ultra-precision sensor technologies. These potential applications emerge from an important consequence of the UVM scientists' new work: it predicts how the uncertainty in the position of the atom changes with the interaction to the other atoms in the solid. \"By reducing this uncertainty, one can measure position to an accuracy below the standard quantum limit,\" Clougherty says. In physics, there are some ultimate limits, like the speed of light -- and that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle prevents perfect measurement of a particle. But this uncertainty can be reduced beyond normal limits by certain quantum tricks -- in this case, calculating the particle's behavior in a special \"squeezed vacuum\" state which reduces the noise of quantum randomness in one variable (location) by increasing it in another (momentum). This kind of mathematical maneuver was behind the creation of the first successful gravitational wave detectors, which can measure changes in distance one thousand times smaller than the nucleus of an atom -- and for which the Nobel Prize was awarded in 2017. Who knows what the Vermont theorists' discovery of a new quantum solution to Lamb's century-old model might reveal.",

Credit: Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences How can the behavior of elementary particles and the structure of the entire universe be described using the same mathematical concepts? This question is at the heart of recent work by the mathematicians Claudia Fevola from Inria Saclay and Anna-Laura Sattelberger from the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, recently published in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society . To the point: Bridging mathematics and physics : The study explores how algebraic and one of the key players in the flourishing field of positive geometry unify physics from subatomic particles to galaxies. Beyond Feynman diagrams : Positive geometry offers a complementary perspective to traditional quantum field theory methods -- providing a geometric framework for describing particle interactions alongside Feynman diagrams. From particle collisions to the Big Bang : Tools from algebraic geometry, D-module theory, and combinatorics drive this interdisciplinary progress -- helping to decode the fundamental structures of particle interactions and the universe's earliest states. Mathematics and physics share a close, reciprocal relationship. Mathematics offers the language and tools to describe physical phenomena, while physics drives the development of new mathematical ideas. This interplay remains vital in areas such as quantum field theory and cosmology, where advanced mathematical structures and physical theory evolve together. In their article, the authors explore how algebraic structures and geometric shapes can help us understand phenomena ranging from particle collisions such as happens, for instance, in particle accelerators to the large-scale architecture of the cosmos. Their research is centered around algebraic geometry. Their recent undertakings also connect to a field called positive geometry - an interdisciplinary and novel subject in mathematics driven by new ideas in particle physics and cosmology. This field was inspired by the geometrical concept of positive geometry which expands the standard Feynman diagram approach in particle physics by representing interactions as volumes of high-dimensional geometric objects, such as the amplituhedron , as introduced by the theoretical physicists Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka in 2013. It carries a rich combinatorial structure and offers an alternative, potentially simpler way to compute scattering amplitudes, from which one can derive probabilities of scattering events. This approach has far-reaching implications that go beyond particle physics. In cosmology, scientists are using the faint light of the cosmic microwave background and the distribution of galaxies to infer what shaped the early universe. Similar mathematical tools are now being applied. For instance, cosmological polytopes, which are themselves positive geometries, can represent correlations in the universe's first light and help reconstruct the physical laws that governed the birth of the cosmos. A Geometry for the Universe The article highlights that positive geometry is not a niche mathematical curiosity but a potential unifying language for form branches of theoretical physics. These geometric frameworks naturally encode the transfer of information between physical systems, for example, by mapping concrete, sensory-based concepts to abstract structures, a process that mirrors how humans metaphorically understand the world. The mathematics behind this is sophisticated and spans multiple disciplines. The authors draw on algebraic geometry, which defines shapes and spaces through solutions to systems of polynomial equations, algebraic analysis, which studies differential equations through mathematical objects called D-modules, and combinatorics, which describes the arrangements and interactions within these structures. The formal objects under consideration, such as Feynman integrals, generalized Euler integrals, or canonical forms of positive geometries, are not merely mathematical abstractions. They correspond to observable phenomena in high-energy physics and cosmology, enabling precision computations of particle behavior and cosmic structures alike. Bridging Scales with Mathematics The study presents an approach with broad applicability and scalability. Scattering processes are often illustrated using Feynman diagrams. Feynman's approach in the study of scattering amplitudes boils down to the study of intricate integrals associated to such diagrams. Algebraic geometry provides a range of tools for systematically investigating these integrals. The graph polynomial of a Feynman diagram is defined in terms of the spanning trees and forests of the underlying graph. The associated Feynman integral can be expressed as a Mellin transform of a power of this graph polynomial, interpreted as a function of its coefficients. These coefficients, however, are constrained by the underlying physical conditions. Feynman integrals are therefore closely connected to generalized Euler integrals, specifically through restrictions to the relevant geometric subspaces. One way to study these holonomic functions is via the linear differential equations they satisfy, which are D-module inverse images of hypergeometric D-modules. Constructing these differential equations explicitly, however, remains challenging. In theoretical cosmology, correlation functions in toy models also take the form of such integrals, with integrands arising from hyperplane arrangements. The complement of the algebraic variety defined by the graph polynomial in an algebraic torus is a very affine variety, and the Feynman integral can be viewed as the pairing of a twisted cycle and cocycle of this variety. Its geometric and (co-)homological properties reflect physical concepts such as the number of master integrals. These master integrals form a basis for the space of integrals when the kinematic parameters vary, and the size of this basis is, at least generically, equal to the signed topological Euler characteristic of the variety. A Field in Motion Fevola and Sattelberger's work reflects a growing international effort, supported by the ERC synergy grant UNIVERSE+ of Nima Arkani-Hamed, Daniel Baumann, and Johannes Henn, Bernd Sturmfels. It brings together mathematics, particle physics, and cosmology focusing on precisely these connections between algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. \"Positive geometry is still a young field, but it has the potential to significantly influence fundamental research in both physics and mathematics,\" the authors emphasize. \"It is now up to the scientific community to work out the details of these emerging mathematical objects and theories and to validate them. Encouragingly, several successful collaborations have already laid important groundwork.\" The recent developments are not only advancing our understanding of the physical world but also pushing the boundaries of mathematics itself. Positive geometry is more than a tool. It is a language. One that might unify our understanding of nature at all scales.",

      "content_text": "Caltech scientists have created a hybrid quantum memory that turns qubit data into sound, allowing it to last up to 30 times longer than with current superconducting systems. Credit: Shutterstock While conventional computers store information in the form of bits, fundamental pieces of logic that take a value of either 0 or 1, quantum computers are based on qubits. These can have a state that is simultaneously both 0 and 1. This odd property, a quirk of quantum physics known as superposition, lies at the heart of quantum computing's promise to ultimately solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Many existing quantum computers are based on superconducting electronic systems in which electrons flow without resistance at extremely low temperatures. In these systems, the quantum mechanical nature of electrons flowing through carefully designed resonators creates superconducting qubits. These qubits are excellent at quickly performing the logical operations needed for computing. However, storing information -- in this case quantum states, mathematical descriptors of particular quantum systems -- is not their strong suit. Quantum engineers have been seeking a way to boost the storage times of quantum states by constructing so-called \"quantum memories\" for superconducting qubits. Now a team of Caltech scientists has used a hybrid approach for quantum memories, effectively translating electrical information into sound so that quantum states from superconducting qubits can survive in storage for a period up to 30 times longer than in other techniques. The new work, led by Caltech graduate students Alkim Bozkurt and Omid Golami, supervised by Mohammad Mirhosseini, assistant professor of electrical engineering and applied physics, appears in a paper published in the journal Nature Physics . \"Once you have a quantum state, you might not want to do anything with it immediately,\" Mirhosseini says. \"You need to have a way to come back to it when you do want to do a logical operation. For that, you need a quantum memory.\" Previously, Mirhosseini's group showed that sound, specifically phonons, which are individual particles of vibration (in the way that photons are individual particles of light) could provide a convenient method for storing quantum information. The devices they tested in classical experiments seemed ideal for pairing with superconducting qubits because they worked at the same extremely high gigahertz frequencies (humans hear at hertz and kilohertz frequencies that are at least a million times slower). They also performed well at the low temperatures needed to preserve quantum states with superconducting qubits and had long lifetimes. Now Mirhosseini and his colleagues have fabricated a superconducting qubit on a chip and connected it to a tiny device that scientists call a mechanical oscillator. Essentially a miniature tuning fork, the oscillator consists of flexible plates that are vibrated by sound waves at gigahertz frequencies. When an electric charge is placed on those plates, the plates can interact with electrical signals carrying quantum information. This allows information to be piped into the device for storage as a \"memory\" and be piped out, or \"remembered,\" later. The researchers carefully measured how long it took for the oscillator to lose its valuable quantum content once information entered the device. \"It turns out that these oscillators have a lifetime about 30 times longer than the best superconducting qubits out there,\" Mirhosseini says. This method of constructing a quantum memory offers several advantages over previous strategies. Acoustic waves travel much slower than electromagnetic waves, enabling much more compact devices. Moreover, mechanical vibrations, unlike electromagnetic waves, do not propagate in free space, which means that energy does not leak out of the system. This allows for extended storage times and mitigates undesirable energy exchange between nearby devices. These advantages point to the possibility that many such tuning forks could be included in a single chip, providing a potentially scalable way of making quantum memories. Mirhosseini says this work has demonstrated the minimum amount of interaction between electromagnetic and acoustic waves needed to probe the value of this hybrid system for use as a memory element. \"For this platform to be truly useful for quantum computing, you need to be able to put quantum data in the system and take it out much faster. And that means that we have to find ways of increasing the interaction rate by a factor of three to 10 beyond what our current system is capable of,\" Mirhosseini says. Luckily, his group has ideas about how that can be done. Additional authors of the paper, \"A mechanical quantum memory for microwave photons\" are Yue Yu, a former visiting undergraduate student in the Mirhosseini lab; and Hao Tian, an Institute for Quantum Information and Matter postdoctoral scholar research associate in electrical engineering at Caltech.

      "content_text": "Graphic showing the mysterious objects in the universe that the University of Missouri researchers identified in their study. Credit: Bangzheng \u201cTom\u201d Sun/University of Missouri In a new study, scientists at the University of Missouri looked deep into the universe and found something unexpected. Using infrared images taken from NASA's powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), they identified 300 objects that were brighter than they should be. \"These mysterious objects are candidate galaxies in the early universe, meaning they could be very early galaxies,\" said Haojing Yan, an astronomy professor in Mizzou's College of Arts and Science and co-author on the study. \"If even a few of these objects turn out to be what we think they are, our discovery could challenge current ideas about how galaxies formed in the early universe -- the period when the first stars and galaxies began to take shape.\" But identifying objects in space doesn't happen in an instant. It takes a careful step-by-step process to confirm their nature, combining advanced technology, detailed analysis and a bit of cosmic detective work. Step 1: Spotting the first clues Mizzou's researchers started by using two of JWST's powerful infrared cameras: the Near-Infrared Camera and the Mid-Infrared Instrument. Both are specifically designed to detect light from the most distant places in space, which is key when studying the early universe. Why infrared? Because the farther away an object is, the longer its light has been traveling to reach us. \"As the light from these early galaxies travels through space, it stretches into longer wavelengths -- shifting from visible light into infrared,\" Yan said. \"This stretching is called redshift, and it helps us figure out how far away these galaxies are. The higher the redshift, the farther away the galaxy is from us on Earth, and the closer it is to the beginning of the universe.\" Step 2: The 'dropout' To identify each of the 300 early galaxy candidates, Mizzou's researchers used an established method called the dropout technique. \"It detects high-redshift galaxies by looking for objects that appear in redder wavelengths but vanish in bluer ones -- a sign that their light has traveled across vast distances and time,\" said Bangzheng \"Tom\" Sun, a Ph.D. student working with Yan and the lead author of the study. \"This phenomenon is indicative of the 'Lyman Break,' a spectral feature caused by the absorption of ultraviolet light by neutral hydrogen. As redshift increases, this signature shifts to redder wavelengths.\" Step 3: Estimating the details While the dropout technique identifies each of the galaxy candidates, the next step is to check whether they could be at \"very\" high redshifts, Yan said. \"Ideally this would be done using spectroscopy, a technique that spreads light across different wavelengths to identify signatures that would allow an accurate redshift determination,\" he said. But when full spectroscopic data is unavailable, researchers can use a technique called spectral energy distribution fitting. This method gave Sun and Yan a baseline to estimate the redshifts of their galaxy candidates -- along with other properties such as age and mass. In the past, scientists often thought these extremely bright objects weren't early galaxies, but something else that mimicked them. However, based on their findings, Sun and Yan believe these objects deserve a closer look -- and shouldn't be so quickly ruled out. \"Even if only a few of these objects are confirmed to be in the early universe, they will force us to modify the existing theories of galaxy formation,\" Yan said. Step 4: The final answer The final test will use spectroscopy -- the gold standard -- to confirm the team's findings. Spectroscopy breaks light into different wavelengths, like how a prism splits light into a rainbow of colors. Scientists use this technique to reveal a galaxy's unique fingerprint, which can tell them how old the galaxy is, how it formed and what it's made of. \"One of our objects is already confirmed by spectroscopy to be an early galaxy,\" Sun said. \"But this object alone is not enough. We will need to make additional confirmations to say for certain whether current theories are being challenged.'' The study, \"On the very bright dropouts selected using the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam instrument,\" was published in The Astrophysical Journal .",

      "content_text": "The new approach uses a purely optical technique called stimulated two-photon excitation to generate streams of photons in different polarization states directly from a quantum dot without requiring any active switching components. Credit: University of Innsbruck, edited Quantum dots - semiconductor nanostructures that can emit single photons on demand - are considered among the most promising sources for photonic quantum computing. However, every quantum dot is slightly different and may emit a slightly different color. This means that, to produce multi-photon states we cannot use multiple quantum dots. Usually, researchers use a single quantum dot and multiplex the emission into different spatial and temporal modes, using a fast electro-optic modulator. Now here comes the technological challenge: faster electro-optic modulators are expensive and often require very customized engineering. To add to that, it may not be very efficient, which introduces unwanted losses in the system. The international research team, led by Vikas Remesh from the Photonics Group at the Department of Experimental Physics of the University of Innsbruck and involving researchers from the University of Cambridge, Johannes Kepler University Linz, and other institutions, has now demonstrated an elegant solution that sidesteps these limitations. Their approach uses a purely optical technique called stimulated two-photon excitation to generate streams of photons in different polarization states directly from a quantum dot without requiring any active switching components. The team demonstrated their technique by generating high-quality two-photon states with excellent single-photon properties. \"The method works by first exciting the quantum dot with precisely timed laser pulses to create a biexciton state, followed by polarization-controlled stimulation pulses that deterministically trigger photon emission in the desired polarization,\" explain Yusuf Karli and Iker Avila Arenas, the study's first authors. \"It was a fantastic experience for me to work in the photonics group for my master's thesis, remembers Iker Avila Arenas, who was part of 2022-2024 cohort of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's program in Photonics for Security Reliability and Safety and spent 6 months in Innsbruck. \"What makes this approach particularly elegant is that we have moved the complexity from expensive, loss-inducing electronic components after the single photon emission to the optical excitation stage, and it is a significant step forward in making quantum dot sources more practical for real-world applications,\" notes Vikas Remesh, the study's lead researcher. Looking ahead, the researchers envision extending the technique to generate photons with arbitrary linear polarization states using specially engineered quantum dots. \"The study has immediate applications in secure quantum key distribution protocols, where multiple independent photon streams can enable simultaneous secure communication with different parties, and in multi-photon interference experiments which are very important to test even the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics,\" explains Gregor Weihs, head of the photonics research group in Innsbruck.
