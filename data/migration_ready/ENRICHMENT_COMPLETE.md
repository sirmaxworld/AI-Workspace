## Known Issues

### 83 Incomplete Enrichments (1.51%)
These companies have source data quality issues:
- Missing required fields (name, description, etc)
- Malformed JSON in source data
- NoneType errors in data access

**Recommendation:** These can be manually enriched after fixing source data, or excluded from initial migration.

## Project Timeline

- **Start:** October 17, 2025 (early morning)
- **Completion:** October 17, 2025 (1:00 PM)
- **Total Duration:** ~8 hours (including optimization iterations)

### Key Milestones
1. Initial parallel processing setup (Claude + GPT-4o-mini)
2. Quality comparison and Claude JSON bug fix
3. Model upgrade to GPT-4o
4. Multi-model strategy (80% Claude, 20% GPT-4o)
5. Discovery and testing of Gemini Flash
6. Production run with 200 workers (Gemini Flash)
7. Verification and migration documentation

---

## Conclusion

The Y Combinator enrichment project has been successfully completed with a 98.49% success rate and optimal cost-performance balance. All data is validated and ready for migration to the new PostgreSQL + pgvector + mem0 architecture.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Database Migration**

**DO NOT POPULATE DATABASE YET** - Architecture setup required first.
