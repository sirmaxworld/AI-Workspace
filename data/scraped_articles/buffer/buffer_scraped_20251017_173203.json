      "content_text": "You're spoiled for choice when it comes to Facebook ads \u2014 from images and videos to carousels and collections, there\u2019s a format (and placement) for just about every goal. Advertising on Facebook also gives you the chance to experiment and find just the right approach for your brand. But with so many options, it\u2019s important to keep up with the latest Facebook ad specs. Facebook offers a world of creative opportunities, and getting the specs right is your first step to making the most of them. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself Googling \u201cFacebook ad sizes\u201d or \u201cMeta ad specs\u201d five minutes before launching a campaign, we\u2019ve got you covered. In this fully updated guide, you\u2019ll find all the current Facebook ad dimensions, file types, and technical details you need to create standout ads in 2025.

But take it from a writer: the good news is that you don\u2019t need to be a designer or a tech whiz to create Facebook ads that work. To help you cut through the jargon, here\u2019s a quick rundown of the most common terms you\u2019ll see when reading this article and creating your ads: Audience network: Allows your Facebook ads to appear in apps and websites outside of Facebook and Instagram that are part of Meta\u2019s ad network. Aspect ratio: The shape of your image or video (for example, 1:1 is a square) Aspect ratio tolerance: How much your ad\u2019s shape can be slightly off from the ideal shape and still be OK. GIF: A short, looping animation made from several images that\u2019s good for quick, fun visuals ( Read our Ultimate Guide to GIFS to learn how to create and use them). JPEG: A common type of image file that works well for photos with lots of colours. MOV: A type of video file, mostly used by Apple devices. Facebook accepts it, too. MP4: A popular video file type that Facebook likes because it looks good and loads quickly. Pixels (px): Tiny dots that make up your image or video. More pixels usually means better quality. PNG: Another image file type that\u2019s good for pictures with text, sharp edges, or transparent backgrounds. Resolution: The clarity of your image or video. Higher resolution means it looks sharper and more professional. \ud83d\udca1 Ads are one part of your Facebook strategy, but don\u2019t forget about optimizing your profile. Click here to find out how to create a perfect cover photo . The anatomy of a Facebook ad Every Facebook ad is built around your objective, your conversion location, and your call to action (CTA). Think of them as your ad\u2019s purpose, destination, and invitation, which all work together to move people toward your goal. Objective: This is what you want your ad to do. Do you want more people to visit your website? Watch your video? Download your app? Facebook offers a wide range of ad objectives so you can choose what fits your goal best. Conversion location: This is where you want the action to happen. Depending on your objective, it could be your website, a mobile app, Instagram profile, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or even a physical store. Note: You need to have a Facebook Page to run ads using the Meta Ads manager. You can then link your Page and Instagram account to run ads on Instagram. You can only link one Instagram account to one Facebook Page. Call to action (CTA): This is the button or prompt that encourages people to take the next step. Options include things like \u201cShop Now,\u201d \u201cLearn More,\u201d \u201cSend Message,\u201d or \u201cDownload.\u201d Picking the right one helps set clear expectations and gives your audience a helpful nudge. Once you\u2019ve chosen an objective, you\u2019ll be able to choose a conversion location and a call to action: Here's a table showing relevant conversion locations and call-to-action (CTA) options based on each Facebook ad objective: Ad Objective Conversion Locations Call-to-Action Options Brand Awareness Facebook Instagram Audience network Learn More Reach Facebook Instagram Messenger Audience network Learn More Send Message Call Now Traffic Website App Messenger WhatsApp Learn More Shop Now Sign Up Contact Us Book Now Get Offer Download Engagement Post Page Event Like Page RSVP Comment Share Learn More App Installs App Store (iOS/Android) Install Now Download Video Views Facebook video player Instagram Watch More Learn More Lead Generation Instant form Website Messenger Instagram direct Sign Up Get Quote Subscribe Apply Now Learn More Messages Messenger WhatsApp Instagram direct Send Message Send WhatsApp Message Create the perfect Facebook ad: design specs for different ad types I once uploaded an ad that looked great on desktop but got weirdly cropped in Facebook Stories; lesson learned. Now I always double-check my dimensions. Using the correct Facebook ad sizes and specs is so important. When your creative meets the recommended guidelines, your ads are more likely to look great, perform better, and help you reach your goals. Quick Tip: I like using Canva to get my visuals sized just right, fast. Just set up a custom image or video using the pixel dimensions below. It makes the whole process so much easier. As an added bonus, when you\u2019re creating organic posts, Buffer\u2019s Canva integration allows you to create scroll-stopping images without leaving the platform. Choose the right Facebook ad format Once you select an objective for your ad, you\u2019ll be guided through the process of creating your ad and get to choose one of four ad types to serve your target audience. Meta offers different types of ads for different products, objectives, and goals: Single image ad: Shows one picture with a message to grab attention. Single video ad: Plays one video to tell a story or show a product. Carousel ad: Several images or videos you can swipe through. Collection ad : Shows a big image or video with smaller pictures underneath to explore more. 1. Single image ad specs Want to drive traffic to your website or app? Start with eye-catching, high-quality visuals. You can use your own photos or tap into stock images to help tell your brand\u2019s story in a way that grabs attention and encourages clicks. Design recommendations File type: JPG or PNG Ratio: 1.91:1 to 4:5 Resolution: 1:1 ratio: 1440 x 1440 pixels 4:5 ratio: 1440 x 1800 pixels Text recommendations Primary text: 50-150 characters Headline: 27 characters Technical requirements Maximum file size: 30MB Minimum width: 600 pixels Minimum height: 1:1 ratio: 600 pixels. 4:5 ratio: 750 pixels. Aspect ratio tolerance: 3% 2. Single video ad specs Show off your product\u2019s best features and capture attention with the power of sound and motion. You can upload a video you\u2019ve already created, or use Facebook\u2019s built-in video tools in Ads Manager to put something together. Design recommendations File type: MP4, MOV, or GIF. ( Here\u2019s a complete list of supported video formats ) Ratio: 1:1 (for desktop or mobile) or 4:5 (for mobile only) Video settings: H.264 compression, square pixels, fixed frame rate, progressive scan and stereo AAC audio compression at 128kbps+ Resolution: 1:1 ratio: 1440 x 1440 pixels 4:5 ratio: 1440 x 1800 pixels Video captions: optional, but recommended Video sound: optional, but recommended Text recommendations Primary text: 50-150 characters Headline: 27 characters Technical requirements Video duration: 1 second to 241 minutes Maximum file size: 4GB Minimum width: 120 pixels Minimum height: 120 pixels 360 videos With some objectives, you can use a 360 video.

Carousel ad specs Carousel ads let you showcase up to ten images or videos in a single ad, each with its own link. They're perfect for highlighting different features of the same product, or even creating one long, swipeable image to tell a visual story. Design recommendations Image file type: JPG or PNG Video file type: MP4, MOV or GIF Ratio: 1:1 or 4:5 Resolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels Text recommendations Primary text: 80 characters Headline: 45 characters Description: 18 characters Landing page URL: Required Technical requirements Number of carousel cards: 2 to 10 Image maximum file size: 30MB Video maximum file size: 4GB Video duration: 1 second to 240 minutes Aspect ratio tolerance: 3% \ud83d\udca1 If you\u2019re interested in using video ads across different placements, I highly recommend checking out this video guide provided by Facebook . 4. Collection ad specs Make it easier for people to shop by displaying items from your product catalog, automatically tailored to each person who sees your ad. When people tap on the collection ad, it opens up and they\u2019re taken into an immersive, full-screen experience (known as instant experience) where they can interact with your branded content \u2014 with the option to exit out of the ad at any time, of course.

      "content_text": "As a creator or brand trying to get going with video marketing it can feel like everyone else has a ring light, a script, and a multi-camera setup \u2014 and you\u2019re still figuring out where to start. You know what helps to remember, though? All of those folks started out exactly where you are now. Video is a great format to explore: it helps your audience connect with you more deeply and puts a face to the (brand) name. It\u2019s not a trend; video marketing is here to stay. Can you succeed in your social media marketing strategy with a text-first approach? Of course. We\u2019ve got tons of data to prove it. You don\u2019t need to hop on the video marketing bandwagon just because everyone says so. However, if you\u2019re shying away from video marketing only because speaking to the camera gives you fear tingles, I have a bumper guide here to make it less intimidating. We\u2019ll unpack questions like: How do you get started with video marketing? How to create high-quality videos that perform well? How do you publish video content consistently without burning out? I also share examples of my favorite creators and brands who are acing video marketing, so you have creators to look to for inspiration! How to build a video marketing strategy in 7 steps Video marketing can be overwhelming. But it becomes easier when you take one step at a time. You don\u2019t have to learn and do it all in one day. Here\u2019s a step-by-step process to follow for creating a successful video marketing strategy: 1. Determine how video fits into your overall social media marketing strategy Video marketing has plenty of benefits: It helps you share authentic stories, foster a stronger connection with your audience, and become more memorable. But don\u2019t hop on video marketing just because everyone else is. You need to figure out how video marketing fits into your larger social media marketing strategy. Does it build trust with your social media community ? Does it help build awareness by showing your products in action? Does it add a touch of human connection to your social profile? Does it help you repurpose content at scale and stay consistent with your social efforts? Your video marketing strategy doesn\u2019t work in a silo. Think of video marketing as a conduit to push your overall marketing strategies. Once you determine where video marketing fits in your funnel, it also becomes easier to develop video content ideas. For example, if you\u2019re creating video content to build awareness about your product or service, you\u2019ll focus on how-to videos and explainer videos. If you\u2019re hoping to convert potential customers who are already product-aware, you might want to show off specific features and how they help solve common problems. 2. Decide which social platforms you will use for video marketing Video content is present on almost all popular social media platforms . But that doesn\u2019t mean you should have a video strategy for every social channel that supports it. That\u2019s a quick road to creator burnout . Start by focusing on social media channels where you\u2019re already present. Would you benefit from adding video marketing to them? Beginning from a platform where you\u2019ve already built a foothold also allows for more experimentation and quicker feedback from your audience. Next, look at where your target audience spends most of their time. For example: More than half of Instagram\u2019s users are 34 or younger . X (formerly Twitter) is most popular amongst the 25-34 age group . Facebook\u2019s largest audience is men between the ages of 25 and 34 . YouTube is the most popular social media channel of choice for Gen Alpha. You want to create video content where your target audience is present and watching. If a majority of your target audience uses a social platform, it\u2019s a good choice for your video marketing strategy. Lastly, you want to examine which social platforms are suitable for the kind of videos you want to create. Instagram Reels are suitable for polished short-form videos. Facebook is good for long-form video content that uses storytelling. LinkedIn is best for thought leadership or behind-the-scenes video content. YouTube is best for long-form videos that require an in-depth exploration of a topic. TikTok videos are best for casual, off-the-cuff, and relatable short-form video content. Learn more about which social platforms are right for you in our chat with Lindsay Gamble : But remember that the above are general cultural preferences of the platform and aren\u2019t set in stone. You can easily repurpose your TikTok videos for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and even Facebook Reels. The difference in each social network isn\u2019t so huge that you have to start from scratch for every platform. Create videos for one platform and adapt them for other networks as much as possible. The ideal social platforms for video marketing will be a combination of the above three: Channels where you already have a social presence Channels where your target audience is present Channels that are suitable for your goals For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re growing your Instagram following and have an audience there. Your followers also watch Instagram Reels and TikTok videos, and your goal is to build deeper brand awareness. Then, Instagram Reels is the best choice for you to begin with. \u26a1 Pro-tip : It\u2019s best to go deep, not wide. Start slow and steady with video marketing in terms of how many social networks you should be on. If you can, start with just one platform and repurpose your videos for the remaining platforms (instead of creating different video content for each channel). To take it even further, choose adjacent networks like TikTok and Instagram because you can easily repackage video content made for one network for the other. Creator, consultant, and speaker Jade Beason also recommends following your genuine interest. \u201cI started on YouTube because I naturally gravitate toward long-form, landscape video content. This made it easier for me to stick with it through all of the hard times, the flop errors, etc.,\u201d she says. \u201cGo with the type of format you prefer, and that will tell you which platform to start with,\u201d she adds. \u201cTikTok is for you if you only like sharing short-form video content. If you like to have multiple formats, then maybe it\u2019s Instagram. If it\u2019s long-form, then it\u2019s YouTube.\u201d 3. Plan your content topics, video script, and content production in advance Video campaigns require preparation before you can sit down and create the actual video. You need to figure out: Video production logistics (equipment, setting up your camera, etc.) Your content topics (for the whole video marketing campaign or just one video) A rough video script Let\u2019s break these down one by one. \ud83c\udfa5 Video production logistics Understanding aperture, focus, and other complicated camera terms can be intimidating. But you don\u2019t need fancy equipment to create high-quality videos. All you need is: A camera: A relatively new phone that can shoot high-quality videos is more than enough \u2014 you might also be able to boost your camera's video quality in your mobile settings. You don\u2019t need a high-end camera to begin your video marketing efforts. A backdrop : You can use a simple wall background or a cute corner of your home. A green screen is also a good option if you need it. A microphone : While you can do without a fancy camera, I\u2019d argue that a mic is a must. When your audio is crisp, your content feels more polished and professional \u2014 even if you filmed it on your phone. If you can, invest in microphones like Shure MV7 or a Rode Wireless ME . But even a relatively inexpensive plug-in lapel mic is more than enough. Something is better than nothing. Natural light : You don\u2019t need a ring light right away. Try to shoot in places that get good sunlight, like directly in front of a window. And while you can just place your camera on a stack of books, a tripod can be handy to get the right angle. In the beginning, try to ace just these three aspects of video production \u2014 it\u2019ll ensure you have high-quality visuals and audio. As you get used to creating videos, you can layer more artificial lights, a better backdrop, etc. Jade also advises choosing a comfortable location. \u201cFilm somewhere where you\u2019re comfortable, especially in the beginning. The more comfortable you are, the easier it will be to come off as yourself on camera,\u201d she says. Remember \u2014 you don\u2019t have to figure all of this out right away. You\u2019ll learn as you go. \ud83d\udcda Content topics You might already have some ideas flowing after figuring out your goals, but also try to seek inspiration from: Other brands and creators : What video content are your competitors creating? How is it performing for them? Can you create videos on the same subject with your unique take? For example, creator Aakanksha Monga provided practical tips to make traveling more affordable (a common topic in her niche): View this post on Instagram A post shared by Aakanksha Monga (@aakanksha.monga) Your audience\u2019s comments, questions, and messages : The best source of content ideas is your audience. Are they asking a question or leaving feedback you could create video content about? Like any other content type, an effective video marketing strategy rests on the foundation of your audience\u2019s needs. For example, business owner Anshita Mehrotra answered a question she received in her Instagram Stories in one of her reels. View this post on Instagram A post shared by anshita mehrotra (@anshiq) Trends : Is there any trend going on in your industry or in the social network as a whole that you could participate in? Tweak it to fit your niche so it doesn\u2019t feel out of place. For example, creator Vibha Sree tried a viral Korean skincare product on Indian skin (since most of her audience is Indian).

      "content_text": "If you\u2019ve been on LinkedIn in the past two to five business years, you\u2019ve definitely seen some nifty swipeable carousel posts. It\u2019s an open secret that LinkedIn carousels \u2014 uploaded documents on LinkedIn \u2014 are among the best ways to engage your LinkedIn audience. With some eye-catching designs and clear value, these document posts are a brilliant way to stop the scroll and stand out from the other posts in your followers\u2019 LinkedIn feed \u2014 something I can personally attest to. I\u2019ve been dabbling with LinkedIn carousels for several months as I build my personal brand on LinkedIn, and they\u2019re some of my top-performing posts this year. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen with Buffer\u2019s LinkedIn page , too. But you don\u2019t have to take my word for it: we\u2019ve got Buffer data to back this up. Analyzing over one million LinkedIn posts sent through Buffer in 2023 revealed that document carousels have the third-highest engagement rate on the platform. Best performing post type on Linkedin by engagement rate Video posts \u2014\u00a04.9 percent Photo posts \u2014\u00a04.8 percent PDF carousel posts \u2014 4.2 percent Text-only posts \u2014 3.6 percent Link posts \u2014 2.7 percent In this article, I\u2019ll walk you through the benefits of using LinkedIn documents, plus share a step-by-step guide to creating a carousel post on LinkedIn and schedule it for the best time to post on LinkedIn . \ud83c\udf89 LinkedIn document scheduling is now available in Buffer for both profiles and pages! Scroll on to learn how to use the feature. Different types of LinkedIn carousels If you\u2019re clued up on the goings-on at LinkedIn, you\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cWait, haven\u2019t carousel posts been discontinued?\u201d You\u2019re not wrong \u2014\u00a0LinkedIn did pull functionality for photo carousels in December 2023 \u2014\u00a0but their document carousels are alive and well. The document carousel and photo carousels look similar when published, and most creators used the term \u201ccarousel\u201d to describe both content formats, which is why things are a little confusing. Technically speaking, there were three different kinds of carousels you could publish on LinkedIn: Document carousel posts (the post format we\u2019re digging into in this article). Photo carousel posts (now discontinued). LinkedIn carousel ads (paid-for or sponsored posts, which you can read more about here ). Unlike photo carousels, document carousel posts are here to stay, and unlike LinkedIn carousel ads, you can publish them for free \u2014 and they\u2019re what we\u2019ll be exploring here. Why you should be tapping into LinkedIn carousel posts Carousel-style posts are top performers on most social media platforms , and LinkedIn is no different. It makes sense that a well-crafted carousel document post will fly on LinkedIn. The LinkedIn algorithm likely registers a scroll or click to view the next slide in a carousel as engagement \u2014 the more engagement a post has, the more likely it is to be shown to more LinkedIn users. And, with a good hook or headline on your first slide to draw your followers in, it will be irresistible for them to click that right arrow. More engagement = greater reach. Some more benefits of leaning into LinkedIn carousels in your content marketing or personal brand building: Stand out in a text-heavy LinkedIn feed. Create content that is high-value but low-effort for your followers to engage with. Build brand awareness and recognition with the ability to use your brand fonts, colors, and style. Easily repurpose content \u2014 blog posts, videos, or even older LinkedIn text posts will do! How to create a carousel post on LinkedIn Creating a carousel post for LinkedIn is pretty straightforward. Here\u2019s a tutorial for creating one from scratch, right through to publishing (scroll on to learn more about LinkedIn PDF scheduling). 1. Create your content Beautiful designs are an important part of LinkedIn carousel posts \u2014\u00a0but I\u2019d argue the actual content is even more so. The eye-catching design of your carousel is what will draw your target audience in, but it\u2019s high-quality content that will make them click over to your page and follow you, visit your landing page, sign up for your newsletter, fill out your lead-gen form or whatever your ultimate call-to-action (CTA) is. That\u2019s why I always focus on the content before even thinking about design. A simple Google Doc or even the Notes app on your phone will work just fine for this, but I like to map out the exact copy or text I want to use on the carousel in Buffer\u2019s Create space . Some tips for your LinkedIn carousel content: Start with a great hook or headline: Draw your reader in with an enticing opening line or title for your carousel. Don\u2019t overthink this \u2014 you can always come back to this once you\u2019ve written up the rest of your pages. Keep it short and simple: Too much text on carousels can be overwhelming (and make it more likely your audience will scroll on past rather than engage). Remember that links won\u2019t work: While links will work in a PDF document, your carousel won\u2019t be clickable on LinkedIn. 2. Design your document Once you\u2019ve created your high-value content, it\u2019s time for that scroll-stopping design I\u2019ve been banging on about. Not a designer? No problem. The beauty of the LinkedIn carousel is that even the most minimal designs will draw the eye because they stand out in the newsfeed by default. Eddie Shleyner is an excellent example of a creator who keeps things simple, relying on simple black-and-white text in his highly engaging carousels. Another option (and my go-to) is to use a template for your document design. Canva has thousands of options specifically designed for LinkedIn posts, and Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides have several dozen themes you can tap into, too. Don\u2019t feel you must stick to text-only carousel cards \u2014\u00a0experiment with graphs, infographics, stock images , and memes. GIFs are great, too, but they will remain stationary when viewed on LinkedIn. \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f Hot tip: Choose a design style and stick to it. Maintaining consistent branding will help your audience recognize posts from you in their feeds and \u2014 if your content resonates \u2014 make sure they engage. 3. Save it as a PDF LinkedIn carousel posts are uploaded documents, usually PDFS, not photos or images. In other words, any image file formats (like JPGs and PNGs) will not work in a carousel-style post. Files types that work for these kinds of posts are: PDF files (.pdf) Microsoft Word or Google Docs documents (.doc and .docx) Powerpoint or Google Slides documents (.ppt and .pptx) Whatever tool you use to create your document, save it as one of the file types above. If you plan to schedule the post with Buffer, be sure to save it as a PDF. Linkedin carousel specs Beyond making sure your document is a PDF or one of the other supported file types, you also need to ensure that your document is less than 300 pages (I\u2019d recommend steering well clear of that!) and a file size no greater than 100MB. Unlike with an image, you don\u2019t need to worry about pixels for a LinkedIn document upload. However, a portrait or square aspect ratio will display best on the platform. \u261d\ufe0f A note on accessibility: Avoid scanning hardcopy documents or converting photos to PDFs for your carousels. These will create image-based (rather than text-based) PDFs that screen readers can\u2019t read. 4. Upload to LinkedIn To share your post right away on the social media platform, log in and make sure you\u2019re on the home page. From there, click the Start your post box and enter a caption for your carousel. Click on the three dots at the bottom of the pop-up window to open more upload options.

Click on the LinkedIn profile or page you want to publish to in the Channels bar on the left, then click the Create Post button or choose the desired publish time in your Queue. If your LinkedIn idea is ready and waiting in Buffer\u2019s Create space , click on the idea card and choose the Create Post button. If you went with option two or three above, choose the LinkedIn profile or page/s you want to publish to at the top of the LinkedIn profile or page window.

      "content_text": "If you\u2019re not an experienced content creator, it might be difficult to determine the best length for Instagram Reels to get the best results. And knowing the ideal number isn\u2019t everything \u2013 your metrics might tell you something entirely different. In this article, we explore everything you need to know about the ideal length of Instagram Reels and other Instagram content \u2013 according to the team themselves. How long can Instagram Reels be? Instagram Reels can be anywhere from 15 seconds to 3 minutes in length. Previously, Reels were capped at 90 seconds, until Instagram increased the length of video uploads in January 2025. \"We\u2019ve heard a lot of feedback from a lot of you creators out there that 90 seconds is just too short,\" Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in a video , \"So we\u2019re hoping that upping that limit up to three minutes will help you tell the stories that you really want to tell.\u201d Technically speaking, you can upload videos as long as 15 minutes on Instagram. However, Instagram sets very clear boundaries for how long a reel should be to perform well (this is an important caveat). When filming a video within the Instagram app, users can choose from various specific durations \u201415 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 90 seconds. Everything from the reel templates to the ideas you\u2019re shown all cap at the 90-second mark, and you won\u2019t be able to film additional clips.\u00a0(At the time, of writing, the 3-minute update had not yet rolled out to all users.) But while you can\u2019t make reels longer than 90 seconds within the app, you can upload longer videos than the available time limits in the content uploading section of your app. The video will just be cut off after the allowed time elapses. \ud83d\udca1 Plan, organize, and schedule your Instagram Reels with Buffer. Here\u2019s how \u2192 Once you\u2019re done editing your video, add eye-catching graphics, a call-to-action (CTA), and hashtags to increase your content\u2019s discoverability in the Instagram feed. Can you upload longer Instagram Reels? Yes, you can upload any video up to 15 minutes, and it will automatically be turned into a reel. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instagram\u2019s @Creators (@creators) When you upload a video filmed or edited outside the Instagram camera, there\u2019s no need to choose a specific video length. You\u2019ll have access to most of the same editing tools and functionality of the reels process (no music or extra clips, so make sure to add that before you upload). Make sure your video fits the expected Instagram Reels dimensions of 1080 x 1920 pixels so it fits neatly into the feed and gives the full-screen experience. If you want to upload a longer reel, simply go to your camera roll and select the video or videos you\u2019d like to upload and they\u2019ll pop up in the editing area. \u26a0\ufe0f Note that these videos are not prioritized by the Instagram algorithm and will not be recommended in the reels tab, but they can be viewed on the Feed and on your profile. How long should an Instagram Reel be? Adam Mosseri , CEO of Instagram, has previously shared that uploading reels longer than 90 seconds could hurt distribution (though we expect this to extend to up to 3 minutes once the update is fully rolled out). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instagram\u2019s @Creators (@creators) However, length is not the only factor you have to consider \u2013 things like high-quality visuals and effective messaging are also vital when it comes to social content and holding user attention. Many creators work around the suggested limit for video lengths by directing their followers to \"read more\" in the captions. They create very short videos that are pleasing to watch in a loop while their audience reads through the captions or engages in the comments. View this post on Instagram A post shared by @designteamofone How long can an Instagram Story be? An Instagram Story can be up to 60 seconds long and will disappear after 24 hours. You can add multiple 60-second videos if you want. Previously, longer videos were broken down into 15-second clips as they were uploaded to Stories, but now the maximum length is 60 seconds, and it remains as a single video. They also won\u2019t appear in your main feed, other users' For You Pages, or following feeds. Your Stories will only be visible when followers tap on your profile photo, either while viewing your profile or within the DMs or messages tab. Here\u2019s a quick tutorial to film or upload content to your Story on Instagram: Tap the Create button \u2013 the + icon at the bottom center of the screen when you open the app Swipe to the Story option, which is the second option in the bottom center Record your Story or upload your content by tapping the bottom left of your screen Add your stickers, music, or text. Hit the \u2192 button to upload! How long can Instagram carousels be? Instagram carousels can have up to 10 photos or videos. Users on mobile can view carousel posts by swiping left, while desktop users can click through using the arrow button on the right-hand side of a post. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instagram\u2019s @Creators (@creators) To create an Instagram carousel post, choose Post in the creation area and hit the overlapping squares in the middle right of the screen to select multiple images and videos. You can add trending sounds or music to your Instagram carousel by clicking on the music symbol in the top right corner of your screen. Make sure your track of choice doesn\u2019t run out before the user has finished swiping through the carousel. The length of Instagram Reels vs. TikToks vs. YouTube Shorts TikTok videos can be up to 30 minutes long , depending on your region. The maximum video length for YouTube Shorts is 3 minutes (any new videos longer than that will be published as regular YouTube videos but keeping the portrait aspect ratio). And of course, the  ideal time limit for Instagram Reels is also 3 minutes seconds, but you can upload videos of up to 15-minutes in length. Reels was Instagram\u2019s response to the rise of TikTok\u2019s short-form content , although TikTok seems to be leaving the short-form space behind to compete with longer-form YouTube videos. The platforms don\u2019t feel all that different. In fact, it\u2019s common for creators to use Instagram Reels on TikTok and YouTube Shorts \u2014 we even recommend doing so for more visibility on your posts. \ud83d\udca1 It\u2019s important to remember that the Instagram algorithm penalizes content with a watermark from other platforms, which is something to consider when cross-posting video content. Refine your social media strategy for short-form video While crossposting your content is the smart choice, especially to ease the content creation process, it\u2019s wise to pick a primary social media platform for your videos and create your content with your target audience\u2019s needs and preferences in mind. If you\u2019re stuck on which short-form video platform is best for you, you might want to create a social media marketing strategy. Everyone from influencers to social media managers finds this process helpful. This social strategy guide will get you started and guide you through some questions to help you make the best choice for your social media goals. Finally, instead of focusing solely on the length of your videos, remember you have to produce quality content on Instagram, too. Your videos should perform well as long as you\u2019re making reels that users find interesting and useful.

      "content_text": "I\u2019m no stranger to a certain amount of time-eating scrolling on social media, but TikTok is something else . I\u2019ve been engrossed by the social media app for hours on end \u2014 and the TikTok algorithm is to blame. But the secret sauce that makes the app so addictive to users is exactly what has content creators and marketers tearing their hair out. Why do certain TikTok videos gain meteoric popularity while others, seemingly of equal quality, barely get a glance? The answer isn't just in the dance moves or trending sounds. The answers lie in a host of signals weighed and analyzed by the TikTok algorithm. The uncannily accurate recommendations are powered by an algorithm that delivers hyper-relevant video content that\u2019ll make you wonder if they\u2019re tracking you. Many creators find it mystical and feel the need to \u2018hack\u2019 or \u2018game\u2019 the algorithm, but that\u2019s unnecessary. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into the TikTok algorithm, how it works, and how you can work with it to enhance your visibility and engagement on the platform and, with any luck, grow your TikTok follower count . \u26a1 Work smarter, not harder: plan, organize, and schedule your TikTok content with Buffer. Here\u2019s how \u2192 Jump to a section: What is the TikTok algorithm? How does TikTok's algorithm work? Does TikTok use a \u201cpoint system\u201d? 5 ways to work with the TikTok algorithm Leverage TikTok SEO Use all the tools in TikTok\u2019s toolbox Publish content consistently Niche down to reach your target audience Balance creativity with conformity Go beyond virality to build genuine connections What is the TikTok algorithm? The TikTok algorithm is the recommendation system that decides which videos appear on a user\u2019s For You Page (FYP) \u2014 the default homepage that surfaces content tailored to each person\u2019s interests. It\u2019s designed to keep users engaged by showing them videos they\u2019re most likely to enjoy based on a wide range of signals. Unlike a chronological or follower-based feed, TikTok\u2019s algorithm prioritizes content relevance over creator popularity . That means even new users with zero followers can have their content pushed to large audiences \u2014 if it aligns with what the algorithm thinks people want to see. At its core, the algorithm is built around one goal: maximize watch time and engagement by showing the right content to the right person at the right time. How does TikTok's algorithm work? TikTok\u2019s algorithm works by analyzing thousands of signals by a user to determine what kind of content they most want to see. These signals \u2014 things like likes, comments, follows, and how long they spend on a particular video \u2014 determine what videos appear on their \u2018For You\u2019 page and in what order. TikTok's For You page, often abbreviated as FYP , has undeniably transformed how we consume content. The For You page is the first page you encounter on TikTok and is filled with recommended content and videos that get more accurate as you spend time on the platform. Unlike the algorithms of YouTube and Instagram (but similar to LinkedIn ), TikTok\u2019s recommendation system serves a mix of quality content from creators you follow and those you've yet to discover from one page. The blend of familiar and new content is tailored meticulously to user preferences, making the social network addictive and fresh. Many other social media platforms have taken a page out of TikTok\u2019s book \u2014\u00a0like Instagram\u2019s Reels feed and Threads\u2019 own For You feed. TikTok does seem particularly good at getting users hooked on the app, leading folks to believe there\u2019s some hidden secret behind the algorithm \u2014 which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. \u201cThere seems to be some perception that they\u2019ve cracked some magic code for recommendation, but most of what I\u2019ve seen seems pretty normal,\u201d says Julian McAuley, a professor of computer science at the University of California San Diego. After viewing some internal documentation on the TikTok algorithm, he spoke to the New York Times . What sets TikTok apart, he said, is that they have \u201cfantastic volumes of data, highly engaged users, and a setting where users are amenable to consuming algorithmically recommended content (think how few other settings have all of these characteristics!). Not some algorithmic magic.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look at how TikTok\u2019s algorithm works for a new user: The user joins TikTok, sharing some basic information as they sign up like age and location. When they first open their brand-new TikTok account, their For You page will show them some of the platform's most popular recent videos, particularly among users who fit their demographic profile. As the user scrolls through the stream of videos, they may like a certain clip, follow a creator, or even tap over to that TikToker\u2019s profile to watch more of their content. Every one of these tiny actions carries a certain amount of weight in the algorithm and signals how much the user liked the content. The more the user is active on TikTok, the more info the TikTok algorithm learns about them, and the better able it is to predict what they want to see. At its core, the TikTok algorithm prioritizes a few key elements, or ranking factors: Engagement This includes likes, shares, saves, comments, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 video watch time. While we don\u2019t know for certain, a fascinating analysis by the Washington Post uncovered that the time users spend lingering on a specific post can have a huge impact on what kind of content is served to them as they continue to use the app. TikTok uses engagement like this as a signal that your content is valuable and worth showing to more users. The more engagement a video gets, the higher its chances of appearing in more FYPs. \ud83d\udc40 Wait \u2014 does engagement really boost reach? It\u2019s a little more nuanced. TikTok doesn\u2019t promote content just because it has a lot of likes or comments \u2014 those metrics serve as signals within a much larger recommendation system. If a video performs well with a small initial audience, TikTok may test it with a larger one. But that next boost depends on how that new audience reacts, not just the engagement numbers alone. User interactions Who your audience follows and engages with can influence the content they see. Video information Details like whether the video was created natively on TikTok, the information in the caption, and any embedded details within the video. Device & account settings Factors like location, language preference, and device type also play a (less important) role. Each one of these factors is in pursuit of one goal: to help users discover new, relevant content . One of the standout features of TikTok's algorithm is its emphasis on content relevance over creator popularity. This means that even if you're new to TikTok, your content can still get significant visibility if it resonates with users. Key tools in this discovery process include: Relevant hashtags Keywords Common search phrases Finally, TikTok won\u2019t recommend certain content on your For You page if: It\u2019s too graphic or endangers the safety of users, It\u2019s tagged as \u201cnot interested\u201d You\u2019ve seen it already This focus on ensuring its users get the most relevant content is one of the best (or not great) things about TikTok because audience size doesn\u2019t matter for your discoverability. Whether you have an existing platform or not, TikTok is an equal playing field for creators. \u23f0 Want to know when you should be scheduling your content for maximum engagement? We analyzed millions of videos to help pinpoint the best times to post on TikTok . Does TikTok use a \u201cpoint system\u201d? You may have come across viral posts or YouTube videos that reference a so-called TikTok algorithm point system \u2014 a scoring model that supposedly ranks user interactions (like likes, shares, and rewatches) with different values to determine whether your video should be shown to more users. While TikTok hasn\u2019t publicly confirmed an exact points-based ranking model, it\u2019s clear that some engagement actions carry more weight than others . For example, a rewatch or share may signal stronger interest than a like or follow, and could result in your video being tested with a larger audience. It\u2019s helpful to think of these actions not as literal \u201cpoints,\u201d but as signals. The more valuable the signal (like someone sharing your video or watching it multiple times), the more the algorithm understands that your content resonated \u2014 and the more likely it is to recommend your video to others. Bottom line: Whether or not there\u2019s a point system under the hood, focusing on engagement that reflects genuine interest (rewatches, saves, shares) is one of the most consistent ways to earn reach on TikTok. 5 ways to work with the TikTok algorithm Understanding the TikTok algorithm is the first step, but how does it translate into actionable advice for creators or tactics that can be worked into a marketing strategy? Here are some ways to harness the algorithm's nuances to enhance your content's reach and engagement. Leverage TikTok SEO It\u2019s no secret that TikTok users treat the platform like the short-form video version of Google. Gen Z, in particular \u2014\u00a0TikTok\u2019s largest demographic \u2014\u00a0uses TikTok like a search engine . As a result, SEO (search engine optimization) should be a key part of any TikTok social media marketing plan can be a powerful way to get more views and followers on TikTok. You\u2019ll find our comprehensive guide to TikTok SEO here , but here\u2019s a quick-start guide: Understand what your audience is searching for: Look at what hashtags are popular on TikTok within your niche and the questions you and other creators in your niche get in the comments. Search for keywords that match your content ideas, and check out the 'Others searched for' keywords in the results. TikTok\u2019s Creative Center is also a brilliant source of popular content, from trending songs to up-and-coming creators. You can also try keyword research tools like Google Trends , Answer the Public , or Exploding Topics . Identify your keywords: Choose 2-3 ke",

      "content_text": "I\u2019m willing to bet that Pinterest isn\u2019t the first platform that comes to mind when you think of monetizing your social media presence. Sure, TikTok , Instagram , and YouTube all offer excellent ways to make money online, but few other platforms have users with the buying intent that Pinterest does. The main reason people use Pinterest is to shop. More than a third (36.6 percent) of Pinterest\u2019s 498 million global active users use the app to follow or research brands and products. Pinterest has capitalized on that, creating helpful tools and features that make it easy for pinners to discover and buy the items or services they want \u2014 making the visual search engine a marketer's, business's, and creator\u2019s paradise. In this article, we'll dig into all of these features and how they can help you make money on Pinterest as a business or creator. \u26a1 Now you can schedule your pins with Buffer whether you have a business or personal account! Find out how to use Buffer with Pinterest \u2192 1. Brand partnerships Partnering with brands on Pinterest works a lot like other social media platforms (perhaps even better, thanks to Pinterest\u2019s paid partnership features ). A paid partnership is a collaboration between a creator and a brand that aligns with their content. These partnerships can take many forms, but often, the creator will feature the brand in their content, whether it\u2019s an unboxing, a review, or just placement within a pin. How to kickoff a paid partnership on Pinterest Pitch yourself: Don\u2019t wait for brands to come to you \u2014 approach them with an idea to feature their product. Include a media kit or pitch deck detailing your audience demographics, saves, impressions, pin clicks, and outbound clicks. (Check your Pinterest Analytics for these numbers and more.) Seal the deal: Once you\u2019ve agreed on a contract with a brand, be sure to be clear on the nitty-gritty details upfront, like whether they have the right to approve your content before you post it, whether they can share it on their social media profiles, and when you can expect to be paid. Post your pins: Retain audience trust by clearly marking sponsored content. Pinterest makes this easy with their paid partnerships tool for creators (more on this below!). Idea ads: Once a creator publishes a pin with the paid partnership label, the brand can promote the pin as an Idea ad. How to use the Pinterest paid partnership tool You\u2019ll need to use the Pinterest app to leverage their partnership features. To do so: Open the Pinterest app on your mobile device. Tap the plus icon at the bottom of the screen, then select Pin. Choose photos or videos from your camera roll, and tap Next . Add your title, pin description, and link, choose a Pinterest board and topic tags, and so on. Tap Advanced settings. Toggle on Add paid partnership label , then Add a brand partner. Search for and select the brand you\u2019re working with. Tap Add on the Approval Needed pop-up window. Tap the back arrow on the top right, then double-check your pin and tap Create to publish. The request will be shared with the brand after you publish your pin. For their name to appear, they must accept the tag. If they don't, the paid partnership label will still appear on the pin, but not the brand's name. Idea ads for paid partnerships Once your paid partnership pin is published, the brand can boost the pin\u2019s reach by turning it into an Idea ad. (Creators can\u2019t create Idea ads for sponsored posts.) When the Idea ad is published, it will appear with the creator\u2019s profile and the 'Paid partnership' label. Here\u2019s a deep dive into how Idea pin ads for paid partnerships work . \ud83d\udca1 When creating pin titles, pin descriptions, and even Pinterest board names, don\u2019t forget to include SEO (search engine optimized) keywords to make it more likely your target audience will discover your content when they search on Pinterest. 2. Affiliate links Affiliate marketing is an excellent way for creators to make a (mostly) passive income with social media platforms, newsletters, and communities \u2014\u00a0anywhere they can share links to products they love with their audience. As I mentioned above, Pinterest is a particularly great place for this because users primarily use the platform to discover and shop for new products. With affiliate marketing programs, creators will get unique links from sellers. If an audience member clicks on that link and goes on to purchase the item, the creator will get a percentage of the sale. Some brands have huge affiliate programs that you can set up on your own and start sharing links right away, like Amazon Associates or the eBay Partner Network . If you\u2019re looking to work with a smaller brand on a long-term affiliate relationship, it might be worth pitching the idea to them. In the pin below, creator Austen Tosone is using a Like To Know affiliate link, which is a program creators must apply for. Once you have your unique product links, Pinterest's product tagging feature makes it easy to share them with your target audience. How to tag affiliate products on Pinterest Create a new pin by clicking the plus icon at the bottom of the Pinterest app, then tap Create Pin . Choose an image or video from your camera roll, then tap Next. Add your pin title, description, and link, choose a board and topic tags, and so on. Tap Tag products , then tap the Add icon . Paste your affiliate link into the URL field. Pinterest will pull through an image of the product. Tap Done. Double-check your pin and tap Create to publish to start earning. 3. Product pins More than 85 percent of Pinterest users have made a purchase based on pins from brands, Pinterest says . \u201cPeople use Pinterest for inspiration, ideas, and shopping. When you add your products to Pinterest as product pins, you make it easy for customers to bring their inspiration and ideas home.\u201d This is why, if you\u2019re a business owner, marketer, or content creator with products to sell, setting up a shop on Pinterest is a no-brainer. The easiest way to get started is by creating product pins , which allow users to shop right in the app. As long as you have an online store that meets Pinterest merchant requirements , it doesn\u2019t matter if these products are physical or digital (say, courses, templates, and guides). Pinterest automatically pulls information about the item onto the pin so your followers can see pricing, availability, and more. In some cases, a pin might even earn labels like \u2018Bestseller\u2019 or \u2018Popular\u2019 if it\u2019s one of the most purchased or clicked items in a product category on Pinterest. Creating product pins requires you to check a few boxes upfront, like making sure you have a Pinterest Business account , claiming your website , and ensuring your e-commerce site adheres to Pinterest\u2019s merchant guidelines . (If you aren\u2019t able to meet these requirements right now, the platform does offer some helpful shop alternatives .) There are two ways to create product pins: Pinterest product catalogs: Uploading your product catalog is your best bet for sharing products on Pinterest in bulk. This will allow you to organize your product pins into groups and run Pinterest ads. Here\u2019s how to upload your product catalog on Pinterest \u2192 Product rich pins: By adding meta tags to your website, people can pin products directly from your site as a type of rich Pin. The pins will always feature the most up-to-date information (like availability or price) on your site. Here's how to create rich pins \u2192 \u2757 Many of the Pinterest features in this article, like paid partnership tools, Idea ads, and product pins, are only available in specific regions. If you get stuck, visit the Pinterest Business or Creator hubs. 4. Drive traffic Platforms like TikTok or Instagram don\u2019t want users to leave their apps and have limited external link options. But Pinterest is the polar opposite \u2014 every single post is created with click-throughs in mind. This is why, whether you\u2019re an online business owner, a marketer, a blogger, a creator, or an influencer, Pinterest marketing can be a powerful tool in helping new audience members discover you. With every pin you post, you can include a URL to an external site \u2014 use it strategically to drive people to the center of your monetization efforts. Whether that is a monetized YouTube channel or a business website, Pinterest can help you make money indirectly by sending users who like your content straight there. Here's a great example from Creating with Kaya , who chose to link out to her blog rather than share products directly on Pinterest. (This is a great option for Pinterest Creators who don't yet have access to product tagging features in their region.) Of course, your Pinterest content must be valuable enough for users to take the extra step and click on the link. Our guide to growing on Pinterest offers useful tips for creating high-quality, click-worthy content that drives conversions \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s well worth reading! 5. Creator Inclusion Fund The Creator Inclusion Fund is a powerful stepping stone for creators in underrepresented communities. Along with a \u201cgrant in the form of cash,\u201d Creator Inclusion program alumni go on to become important creator partners for the platform and are offered \u201cexclusive opportunities, creator events, and more,\u201d Pinterest says. The immersive, six-week program is exclusively for underrepresented communities. The platform launched the Inclusion program in 2021 to \u201cuplift creators from communities that have been disproportionately underrepresented\u2014including Black, Latin\u00e9, LGBTQIA+, Asian, Indigenous people, and people with disabilities.\u201d Once accepted into the program, creators are required to commit to six sessions (1 hour per week) and create 20-25 pieces of content. To be eligible, creators must: Identify as being part of an underrepresented community Have a Pinterest business account in certain regions Be 18+ years old Create content in the fashion, beauty, art, lifestyle, home, or food niches Have between 500 - 10,000 followers on ",

      "content_text": "As a creator or influencer, I\u2019m willing to bet a good chunk of your content involves sharing products, tools, and services you love. This happens organically and authentically when you give your followers a peek behind the curtain of your life. [insert infomercial voice here] What if I told you that you could make money from doing this? OK, I promise I\u2019m not trying to scam you. But it does sound too good to be true, right? Thankfully, for millions of full-time creators around the world, it\u2019s not. According to a survey of 2,270 affiliate marketers by Authority Hacker, the \u201caverage\u201d affiliate marketer earns over $8,000 monthly, and 35 percent of respondents use social media platforms to sell. Affiliate programs offer a low-risk (and low-cost) way for creators to earn commission from recommending products they love. It\u2019s a win-win for both the brand and the creator \u2014 a way for the former to leverage influencer marketing to find new customers and for the latter to make money from content they\u2019re likely already sharing. Let\u2019s get into how affiliate marketing works, how you can join an affiliate program as an influencer, and some tips to kickstart your affiliate marketing strategy. What is affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing is performance-based online marketing, where a business pays another business or person for referring a sale or new customer. In influencer affiliate programs, a creator or influencer earns commission from products or services sold via a unique tracking link or discount code. There are many different types of affiliate or referral programs and entire digital marketing businesses built off the model (like review sites, coupon sites, or email marketing and email lists). In this article, we\u2019ll focus on affiliate networks for social media influencers or creators. So, what exactly does an affiliate marketer do in this case? Here\u2019s how it works: Most often, affiliates create social media content related to the product or service they have an affiliate link for (ideally, one they genuinely use and love). They will include that unique shopping link in their content so followers can click through and buy that product. When they do, the creator will earn a percentage of the profit of that sale. In many popular affiliate programs, the customer eyeing the product doesn\u2019t even need to click \u2018add to cart\u2019 immediately. If they purchase the product within a specific time frame (say, 30 days after first visiting the product page via the affiliate link), the original creator will still earn a commission from that sale. It\u2019s worth noting that affiliate commission rates are usually not huge \u2014 mostly under five percent of the cost of the item. Affiliate income probably won't replace your regular income unless you have a large, highly engaged following or inspire some high-ticket affiliate sales. If \u201cfull-time creator\u201d is your goal, you\u2019ll want to have other income streams, too. (Scroll on for resources that will help.) The benefits of affiliate marketing as a route to monetization Affiliate marketing programs are a great way to diversify your income streams as a creator or influencer looking to monetize your social media presence. Here\u2019s a look at some of the ways it can work for you: Greater creative control: Unlike brand partnerships, most affiliate programs don\u2019t stipulate the kind of marketing campaigns influencers must create to promote their products. You\u2019re free to share your recommendations in a way that aligns with your social media strategy and target audience. A route to passive income: Earning commissions from sales doesn\u2019t mean constantly sharing products and links with your followers. On platforms where content has a little more longevity and social media SEO (search engine optimization) comes into play (like YouTube, Pinterest, and, to an extent, TikTok), users searching for specific products may come across your older content. Using a link-in-bio tool like Buffer\u2019s Start Page to share products you recommend is also a great way to keep things ticking over. Performance-based earnings: The more effective your content marketing is, the higher your earning potential. It\u2019s as simple (and complex!) as that. \u26a1 Still working on growing an engaged social media following ? Buffer can help, with planning, scheduling, and analytics tools for Instagram , Facebook , TikTok , YouTube , Pinterest , and more. How do I get into affiliate marketing? Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to becoming an influencer affiliate marketer. 1. Explore affiliate programs Kickstart your affiliate marketing with some good old-fashioned research into the plethora of affiliate sites that run programs. (Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve done some of the work for you \u2014 see the list of the best affiliate programs below.) When exploring affiliate networks and retailers, consider the following: Commission rates: How much can you earn sharing the program\u2019s affiliate products? Will your earnings cap at a particular amount? Product relevance: Choose affiliate products that make sense for you and your audience. At the bare minimum, you\u2019ll need to be familiar with the products or services you\u2019re recommending. Ideally, you want the affiliate partner company\u2019s products to be items you use and love. Brand reputation: Don\u2019t throw away the trust you\u2019ve built with your audience. Be sure to do your research on any companies you\u2019re looking to partner with to ensure they align with your brand and values. 2. Apply or set up your profile Every affiliate program application process is different. Amazon, for example, requires you to complete a form, though most brands will vet your content and profile somehow. Be sure to share working links and accurate metrics. If you don\u2019t already have one, a simple website or landing page is a requirement for many affiliate programs. Again, Buffer\u2019s Start Page can be a great place to, well, start. It\u2019s free to use and won\u2019t take more than a few minutes to set up. 3. Reach out to brands that don\u2019t have an official program It might be the case that your most beloved brand isn\u2019t part of a formal program like the ones listed below. This doesn\u2019t mean an affiliate partnership is off the table, however. Consider reaching out to the brand to pitch a collaboration. Make sure the pitch is professional, details how you love and use the product or service, and includes some examples of how your audience aligns with their ideal customer. Be sure to attach your influencer media kit , too. You may find that many brands are more open to these kinds of deals because you\u2019ll be required to actually generate some sales before you\u2019re paid (again, win-win). 4. Create authentic content about the products Unlike some scammy TikToks and YouTube videos will have you believe, affiliate marketing is not simply just dumping products on Pinterest and hoping for payouts. It requires an intentional affiliate marketing strategy that won't alienate your current followers. You\u2019ll find the word \u201cauthentic\u201d in this article repeatedly, with good reason. Your followers engage with your content because they trust you and you provide some value to their lives. Sharing salesy content with them is a surefire way to lose their trust (and follow, too). Weave your affiliate marketing content into your content calendar sparingly, especially at first. Think candid product reviews, tutorials, and product round-ups \u2014\u00a0your affiliate marketing efforts should look and feel just like your regular, quality content. Here\u2019s a great example from @me.and.my.curls , who shares all the haircare products she uses in her styling routine in this video, along with tips and tricks for the routine. The latter ensures the content is still valuable to her followers, even if they don\u2019t go on to buy the affiliate products \u2014 Sandi retains her audience's trust, a key for successful affiliate marketing. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sandi \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Curly Hair Care, Clean Beauty (@me.and.my.curls) This TikTok by @julianna_claire , a creator who specializes in finding gems on Amazon, is another great example. @julianna_claire It\u2019s giving \u2728 overachiever \u2728 vibes. #amazonfinds #amazonfinds2023 #travelfavorites #travelfavorites #travelmusthaves #travelmusthave #travelgadgets #travelgadget #travelessentials #airportessentials #travelessentialsfromamazon #amazontravel #travelorganization #travelorganizing #travelorganizer \u266c original sound - Julianna\u2002|\u2002Amazon\u2002Finds Beyond that, always disclose that you are sharing an affiliate link with your followers. Again, this comes back to maintaining the trust of your audience, but in many countries, this disclosure is also legally required. How do affiliates get paid? That depends on the affiliate program in question, though the standard practice for payouts is to offer the affiliate a direct deposit or a discount or voucher for their own purchases. Amazon Associates, for example, offers affiliates the option of being paid by direct deposit, with a gift certificate, or by check. It\u2019s worth noting that many programs have a minimum payment threshold in order to trigger the payout (for example, you\u2019ll need to earn at least $50 before the program will pay you). This can be frustrating for affiliates just starting out, so it\u2019s worth exploring all the Ts&Cs before you sign up for a program. 4 best affiliate programs for influencers and creators There are thousands of affiliate programs out there, some run by the brands themselves, others facilitated by product marketplaces or affiliate intermediaries. Here\u2019s a look at some of the best ones to join if you\u2019re an affiliate marketing beginner. 1. Amazon Associates and Influencer Program Thanks to the huge variety of products the e-commerce giant offers, Amazon Associates is perhaps the most popular affiliate program. The program caters to influencers, content creators, publishers, podcasts , and bloggers and offer up to 10 percent commission on some products. Amazon has a robust system to manage this, too, such as Associates Central",

      "content_text": "There's no doubt about it: Threads is here to stay. After a record-breaking start, Threads is fast proving that it was no fly-by-night fad but a force to be reckoned with among the other social media giants. Threads by Instagram now has 150 million monthly active users and counting. To put that into perspective, that's a little over a third of X's (formerly Twitter) monthly active users of 550 million \u2014 and X has a good 16 years on Threads. There have been some growing pains, sure. Engagement bait is an issue the Threads app team is \"working to get under control,\" Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri recently shared on Threads , along with some gaps in its content moderation system. \"We\u2019re fixing this so they can make the better calls and we can make fewer mistakes,\" Mosseri wrote. \"Thanks for your patience and keep the feedback coming.\" Teething pains aside, the platform has become incredibly popular in certain niches (more on this below). Threads bears a striking resemblance to X, but fans are quick to point out the community-building focus. A clever tags system \u2014 a bit like a marriage between hashtags and subreddits \u2014 and a host of handy new Threads features have been a catalyst for growth in recent months, with more to come. Buffer users are big fans of the platform, too. Plenty of Bufferoos have become regular users of the tool, with a handful of teammates finding success (and building a Threads community) in some niches. Head of Communications and Content Hailley Griffis has loved connecting with other moms. Staff Product Manager Amanda Marochko has been growing a following by sharing more about how Buffer builds in public. Staff Product Manager and alt-rock musician Brandon Green has gained over 2,000 followers in just a few months Threads \u2014 which is particularly impressive, considering he wasn't active on Instagram and didn't have a following he could migrate over. Successful as it may be, Threads is still in its infancy, so it's difficult to predict a guaranteed path to help you gain followers \u2014 though with social media algorithms constantly evolving, we can't really say that about any! Still, in our time on the Threads app, we've picked up some patterns, along with some helpful insider tips from the Threads team. On that note, be sure to check out our conversation with Etienne Blanc , Product Marketing Manager at Threads, below. It's a must-watch for creators and brands looking to learn more about how to get more followers on Threads. In this article, I'll share nine tips for doing exactly that. Here's how to grow on Threads, with advice from the Threads team, along with Bufferoos doing just that. Ass we've seen with social media platforms like Instagram and, more recently, TikTok, growing a following early, before the space becomes too crowded, is often a little easier \u2014 so it's worth investing in now. 1. Let your other followers know you're on Threads The good news: When you first set up your Threads account, you probably won't be at 0 followers for long. Your Instagram followers who are already on Threads will get a notification when you sign up and prompt them to follow you \u2014 this is how both Hailley and I built up sizeable chunks of our Threads followings at the outset. Unsurprisingly, Threads and Instagram integrate really well, so it's easy to cross-post from one platform to the other. Tap the paper plane icon below any threads you post to share it to your Instagram Stories or straight to your feed. Your content will appear over a Threads background like the one below (but note that any media you add won't be automatically shared as a regular feed post). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kirsti Lang (@itsmekirsti) Tapping on the thread in an Instagram Story will send your followers straight to your Threads feed, so if you're looking to drive traffic there, Stories may be your best bet. It's worth letting your followers on other social platforms know they can find you on Threads, too \u2014 especially if you're leaving those platforms to focus on Threads. Social Media Consultant Matt Navarra , a formerly avid tweeter, ditched X in favor of Threads several months back and ensured his X followers knew how to find him by amending his bio and handle. News you're active on Threads doesn't have to be quite as all-or-nothing, but the occasional tweet or LinkedIn post reminding people they can find you on Threads \u2014\u00a0and what you'll be sharing there \u2014 can help grow your following. 2. Find your niche Brandon has found particular success from \u201cleaning hard into a niche,\u201d he says. The beauty of Threads is that even the nichest of niches are finding a home and target audience. For Brandon, that's being a \u201cmusic theory nerd with specific tastes, but also working in tech.\u201d \u201cBeing vulnerable about those things seems to resonate strongly,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis shows up not just in likes and follows but also in the types of replies, which are often much more conversational.\u201d Not sure where to focus your attention? Follow these steps to identify your content pillars , which can be a helpful starting point for your Threads social media strategy Once you've found your niche (or a few) to focus on, it's time to tap into tags. Threads tags are hashtags \u2014 with a twist. Unlike on other platforms, Threads tags function more like topics than just a filtered search. The goal, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri shared in an update , was to \u201chelp us build a space that really fosters healthy conversation.\u201d The feature seems to be working as intended. It's a great way to find other people in your niches (and, in turn, grow your following). \u201cUsing tags has helped me connect with like-minded individuals in specific spaces,\u201d Amanda says. \u201cI'm being more intentional about who I'm following on Threads versus how I've approached it on other networks, really looking to follow other individuals in the Product Management space or those who work in social media.\u201d Hailley agrees. She sees tags as a way to \u201cposition a thought to an intended audience.\u201d \u201cThis seems to yield wider reach and engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cI know if I post something with a tag, I'll get folks who also interact with that tag to engage.\u201d 3. Spark conversations Comments are currency on Threads. Creators and brands hoping to gain followers on Threads should remember that Threads is \"a real-time conversation app,\" Emily Dalton Smith, a VP of product management at Meta and the head of Threads, told Business Insider. Threads posts that \"drive conversations are more likely to get recommended,\" the company says. In my chat with Etienne Blanc, Product Marketing Manager at Threads, this is something that came up a lot. \"Really try sparking conversations by sharing your everyday thoughts,\" he said. \"Ask other people to weigh in, react, and give their opinion.\" He also pointed out that it's crucial to respond to replies you get on your Threads posts to keep the conversations going, but also to weigh in on other's posts where you have something thoughtful to add. \"Threads is a public conversation app \u2014 it's not only about top-level posts but also replies. This might be even more important in terms of building community.\" Net-new content is not always the answer, which is something I can personally attest to. I\u2019ve found that jumping into the comments and (thoughtfully!) weighing in on threads in my niche can be just as effective at growing my following as sharing original content. For example, while the comment below didn't get much engagement, I woke up to find a flurry of notifications after sharing my thoughts on a thread started by one of my favorite creators. And it took far less effort and brainpower than creating something new! 4. Keep your finger on the pulse Tied to the advice above is the fact that, like X, Threads is where many people go to get and share opinions on newsworthy topics. \"Most of the content will be distributed in just a few hours over the course of the day,\" Dalton Smith said. \"Making sure that you're talking about things that are happening now and that are really timely and relevant will go a long way.\" Etienne advised that creators \"chime in on cultural moments where discussions are happening to give your own take,\" so that you're meaningfully contributing to those discussions. 5. Be authentic and helpful I've often seen people talk about how different Threads feels different from other social media platforms. Of course, it'll depend on what the Threads algorithm predicts you'll like, but my experience on Threads has been a lot more wholesome than I've found elsewhere. Designer and Threads user Dannielle Cresp agreed \u2014 she shared some valuable insights with me about it in a great chat (you guessed it) on Threads. \u201cFor me, it's about interacting with a sense of community and choosing to be both kind and helpful. It can be a friendly and welcoming space if you curate with that in mind.\u201d As Brandon touched on above, vulnerability and authenticity have benefited him too or, in his words: \u201cPosting things that are thought-provoking and showing (the weirder sides of) my personality. Threads definitely feels like a people-first platform, at least for now.\u201d As Brandon touched on above, vulnerability and authenticity have benefited him too or, in his words: \u201cPosting things that are thought-provoking and showing (the weirder sides of) my personality. Threads definitely feels like a people-first platform, at least for now.\u201d 6. Post consistently While posting daily or even a couple of times a week seems to work well when it comes to increasing followers on LinkedIn or growing on Instagram , Threads seems to require a higher volume of posts for growth than other social media platforms. \u201cI'm probably posting 10-12 times a day right now on most days, and I can see my follower count increases loosely correlating with how much I'm posting,\u201d Brandon says. Hailley, too, has found success in being active more often. \u201cPosting regularly absolutely helps grow my threads. I've seen a noticeable ",

      "content_text": "The creator economy is \u201cbeautiful,\u201d Bluesky says \u2014\u00a0and they\u2019re going to be a part of it. This according to the decentralized social platform \u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Rose Wang , who shared details about the company\u2019s plans to create a way for creators to monetize, along with a subscription model, in the coming months. Rose shared more about what these systems might look like for the rapidly growing Bluesky user base, now at over 25 million, in an episode of Buffer Chat: The Podcast. With the platform promising not to turn to advertising \u2014 \u201cThat's not what we believe in at Bluesky,\u201d Rose says \u2014 they\u2019re looking at other ways to make money, and share it with the creators, too. Here\u2019s a look at all the news Rose shared: Subscriptions on Bluesky: What to expect Rose revealed that subscriptions are slated to launch in 2025 \u2014 emphasizing that this doesn\u2019t mean Bluesky will be pay-to-play. \u201cWe would never put features like posting or bookmarks or like actual core features of the app behind a paywall,\u201d she says. \u201cThat's just not the point of the subscriptions.\u201d So what will users be paying for, then? \u201cIt\u2019s a way for users to get more what we call \u2018self-expression tools\u2019,\u201d she says. Here\u2019s a sneak peek at what the subscription model will include: Custom icons: Personalize your profile with unique visual elements. More for custom domains: Bluesky already offers custom domains , but Rose hinted that there were \"more interesting\" things coming for subscribers. Extended video uploads: Share longer, higher-quality video content. Monetization for creators on Bluesky It looks like some sort of monetization for creators and curators will form part of their payment model, though this feature won\u2019t be dropping quite as soon as early 2025. Rose shared how the small team is setting the stage for a creator monetization system. \u201cRight now, we're seeing a lot of creators, developers, and curators who are getting paid on Patreon and Ko-fi for the feeds or a little bot that they created that people really love,\u201d Rose says. \u201cAnd so what we want to do is follow that.\u201d The plan is to build a system where creators can get paid right on Bluesky and any other platforms built on their open AT Protocol ecosystem. \u201cAnd then we'll increase the volume of those transactions, and the creators and folks take home most of it, and we just take a percentage of the transaction fee,\u201d Rose says. \u201cAs they make more money, we should make money \u2014 but if they aren\u2019t, we shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d Rose shared that, due to the complicated nature of payment systems, monetization probably won\u2019t be coming to Bluesky for the next 12 months at least. \u201cIt takes time \u2014 payments just take a while. But absolutely, it\u2019s one of the things that we are prioritizing.\u201d \ud83d\udca1 Want to get started on Bluesky but wary of adding another platform into the mix? With Buffer, you can test the waters by crossposting content you\u2019re already sharing on X, Threads, LinkedIn, Instagram, and more. Here\u2019s how \u2192 What sets Bluesky apart It\u2019s clear that Bluesky hopes to welcome creators from other networks. Along with promises of monetization, there are some pretty unique perks that come with building a following \u2014 or rather, community \u2014 on Bluesky as a creator. Your audience is yours One of Bluesky\u2019s strongest selling points is the idea of portability. That\u2019s because Bluesky\u2019s AT Protocol is open-source, and available for any developer to build their own social platform on. So, if you decide to leave Bluesky for another platform, you don\u2019t have to leave your audience behind and start from scratch. Rose described this as \u201cvoting with your feet\u201d: \u201cIf you like another app more, you can leave Bluesky, and your audience can come with you. The data lives in a shared, open system, not on a single app.\u201d Sharing links won\u2019t affect your reach Bye-bye, link in bio. It\u2019s no secret that other social platforms want to keep their users on-platform, and so creators who might want to direct their audience elsewhere \u2014 say, a website, an article, or an affiliate store \u2014 have to get really creative about how they share links to other sites. \u201cIf I\u2019m a stand-up comedian,\u201d Rose says by way of example, \u201cand I\u2019m posting funny posts all the time, but then I want to send people to my show, I should be able to do that and reach my entire audience. But that\u2019s not happening.\u201d As soon as you post the link for your stand-up show, what we\u2019re seeing is that people are getting de-promoted. So their posts that are funny and get 1,000 likes \u2014 because it helps people stay on the platform \u2014 then when they try to ask folks to leave to go to see a show, they get 60 likes. They\u2019re like, something\u2019s wrong, right?\u201d \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the promise of Bluesky. You get to own that relationship with your audience. And so it\u2019s flexible. You can go create a feed or a list, and you can directly reach your folks. There\u2019s no de-promoting links on Bluesky.\u201d No \u2018black box\u2019 algorithm Another very strong point in Bluesky\u2019s favor: creators won\u2019t have to grapple with an unpredictable algorithm. Instead of relying on a single algorithm to determine what users see, Bluesky lets users build and share their own feeds and \u2018Starter Packs\u2019, and create moderation labels. \u201cSo many people are starting to create livelihoods online, and we want to enable that,\u201d Rose says. \u201cWe think the creator economy is beautiful and only growing. \u201cImagine if you're no longer tied to the algorithm, and you can reach your audience.

      "content_text": "Timing can make or break many things: Heating leftover pizza in the microwave, delivering a punchline for a joke, canceling a free trial \u2014 and it\u2019s no less important when it comes to the best time to post on Twitter. OK, OK: Posting your tweets at the right time might not be as critical as, say, preventing soggy pizza, but it\u2019s still an important consideration when it comes to your social media marketing strategy . I hear what you\u2019re thinking: X no longer has a chronological feed \u2014 how can the time you post matter so much when X\u2019s algorithm is in the driver\u2019s seat? Posting times might not be as vital as they were in Twitter\u2019s early days, but they still seem to affect content performance on X. Remember: X/Twitter\u2019s algorithm values engagement \u2014 which is why we used engagement rate as the metric to measure the success of more than 1 million tweets sent through Buffer. Our findings were fascinating. We uncovered definite patterns in what posting times, days, and content types tend to get more engagement than others, helping us make some recommendations about not only the best time to post on Twitter, but the best day and the best content format to post as well. Let\u2019s take a closer look. Jump to a section: The best time to post on Twitter/X The best time to post on Twitter/X on Monday The best time to post on Twitter/X on Tuesday The best time to post on Twitter/X on Wednesday The best time to post on Twitter/X on Thursday The best time to post on Twitter/X on Friday The best time to post on Twitter/X on Saturday The best time to post on Twitter/X on Sunday The best time to post on Twitter/X for each day of the week The best and worst days of the week to post on Twitter/X The best type of content to post on Twitter/X The best time for you to post on Twitter/X Your checklist for high-performing X/Twitter posts The best time to post on Twitter/X The best time to post on Twitter or X is 9 a.m. on Wednesday. Tweets posted at those times tend to have the highest engagement rates, according to our analysis of more than 1 million tweets. The next best time to post on Twitter is Tuesday at 8 a.m., followed by Monday at 8 a.m. \ud83c\udf05\u00a0Tweeting during mid-morning every weekday tends to yield solid engagement. Other notable posting times are all during this morning period. The darkest slots represent the time slots with the highest engagement rates and, we extrapolate, the best time to post on Facebook. The light to white blocks are the time slots with the lowest engagement \u2014 times that are perhaps left out of your posting schedule. According to demographic data from Statista , 36.6% of Twitter users are between 25 and 34. The second-largest age group of users, 34.2%, are between 18 and 24. This suggests that Twitter users are likely logging on to check their feeds as they arrive and settle in at work in the morning. On most weekdays, the peak hours for social media engagement are similar. Engagement tends to climb from the early morning on weekdays, peaking at around 9 a.m., then slowly petering out in the early afternoon, towards the end of the workday. \ud83c\udf0f Wait, what time zone? To make this data easier to understand, our data scientist Bufferoo has done some mathematical magic to make the recommended time zones universally applicable. In other words, no need to convert \u2014\u00a0consider all the recommendations local time. Whether you're in EST (Eastern Standard Time), PST (Pacific Standard Time), or IST (Indian Standard Time), the times apply to you. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Monday The best time to post on Twitter on Monday for maximum engagement is 8:00 a.m., with other optimal posting times at 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Early morning tweets tend to perform well as our data suggests Twitter users tend to check their feeds before diving into work. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Tuesday The best time to post on Twitter or X on Tuesday is 8 a.m., followed closely by 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. This makes sense \u2014 Tuesday is one of the highest engagement days on the platform, with users settling into their weekly routines. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Wednesday The best time to post on Twitter on Wednesday is 9 a.m., with 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. also being strong posting windows. Midweek engagement peaks as people look for fresh content while taking a break from work. Wednesday is definitely worth adding to your posting schedule, too, as these slots were among the peak times in our analysis. High engagement time slots tend to go slightly later on Wednesday too, with some early afternoon times offering good results. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Thursday On Thursday, the best time to post on Twitter is 9 a.m., with 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. also performing well. As the weekend approaches, engagement remains high as users look for updates and trending conversations. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Friday The best time to post on Friday is 8 a.m., with 9 a.m. and 7 a.m. also being optimal posting times for maximum engagement. Morning tweets tend to do best as people check Twitter before winding down for the weekend. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Saturday Saturday engagement is lower overall, but the best time to post on Twitter is 8 a.m., with other peak hours at 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. Even on the weekend, early-morning posting times tend to perform better than later in the day. The best time to post on Twitter/X on Sunday Sunday has the lowest engagement levels, but if you must tweet on Sunday, the best time to post on Twitter is 8 a.m., with 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. also being peak times to post for maximum engagement on this slower day. The best time to post on Twitter/X for each day of the week Monday: 8 a.m., 9 a.m., 10 a.m. Tuesday: 8 a.m., 9 a.m., 10 a.m. Wednesday: 9 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m. Thursday: 9 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m. Friday: 8 a.m., 9 a.m., 7 a.m. Saturday: 8 a.m., 7 a.m., 9 a.m. Sunday: 8 a.m., 7 a.m., 9 a.m. \ud83d\udca1 Just as there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all best time to post, there\u2019s no single best time to post across all social media platforms. Here\u2019s the best time to post on Instagram , the best time to post on LinkedIn , the best time to post on Facebook , and the best time to post on TikTok . The best and worst days of the week to post on Twitter/X The best day of the week to tweet is Tuesday . Wednesday comes in second place in terms of engagement on the platform, and Thursday comes third (though, as you\u2019ll see from the graph below, Monday and Friday aren\u2019t too far behind). The worst day of the week to post on Twitter is Sunday, with Saturday only slightly better. While some posting times seem to see solid engagement on the weekend, you\u2019re probably better off sticking to tweeting on weekdays. If you prefer to batch-prep content for your Twitter account during downtime on the weekends (high five for that), you might want to schedule posts for weekdays instead. This is where\u00a0social media scheduling tools like Buffer really shine. Experiment by systematically going through the times on the list above, scheduling posts in those slots, and then tracking their social media performance to see what works best for your specific target audience. The best type of content to post on Twitter/X Despite X\u2019s ongoing push for video \u2014 rolling out longer uploads, higher resolution options, and even revenue-sharing for video creators \u2014 our data shows that text-based posts still reign supreme when it comes to engagement. Text posts received 30.04% more engagement than video posts and 37.10% more engagement than image or photo posts . It makes sense when you think about what sets X apart from other social platforms. While TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are battling for video dominance, X has always been a text-first platform \u2014 a place for real-time updates, hot takes, and punchy one-liners. That said, video did outperform image posts, earning 5.43% more engagement than pictures . On the other end of the spectrum, posts with links and retweets were both poorer performers. The former makes sense \u2014 social media platforms tend to want to keep users there, rather than having them click out to other content and sites. The performance of retweets (which includes quote tweets, too) is also worth noting. While it\u2019s a great way to show support for other creators, retweets shouldn\u2019t be a primary focus if you\u2019re looking to grow your following on X. The best time for you to post on Twitter/X While tweeting at specific times may yield brilliant results right out the gate, it\u2019s not a given that some timing tweaks will supercharge your content\u2019s performance on X. How come? Well, all target audiences are different. The timing that works to engage one cohort may not work for another. While the general best times to post on Twitter are a great jumping-off point, it\u2019s important to fine-tune your social media strategy and figure out what gets the best results for you. Now, how do you do that? Especially now that, unlike other social media platforms, Twitter analytics are behind the paywall of X Premium. A social media management tool like Buffer can help. Buffer\u2019s X analytics compares the performance of all your tweets and connects the dots for you.

      "content_text": "If you scroll through your email inbox, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re subscribed to some kind of newsletter. And while plenty of those subscriptions may be for companies and brands , there\u2019s recently been a surge in the popularity of individual newsletters. Substack , a platform dedicated to free and paid email newsletters, received over 24.57 million visits in September 2021. Journalists flocked to the site in 2020 , leaving newsrooms to become their own bosses. And that\u2019s the great thing about creating your very own newsletter \u2013 the autonomy it provides. A newsletter can become an unfiltered channel for all of your ideas, personal and professional updates, and any other musings you may want to share with the world. This flexibility makes it a great medium for individuals in all fields, not just journalists and writers. If you\u2019re interested in building community and establishing yourself as an expert on a certain topic, an individual newsletter may be perfect for you. The benefits of having an email newsletter Writing a regular newsletter is a great way to network with like-minded people while also connecting with a new audience. As you share your perspective, you can even become a thought leader and build up your personal brand and credibility with readers. In fact, if your audience feels like they\u2019re benefiting from your words enough, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll be willing to pay for your newsletter. In this way, a newsletter can even become your very own business, something you\u2019ll see in the below examples. 5 successful newsletters from people we admire There\u2019s no right or wrong way when it comes to setting up an email newsletter. These examples of newsletters from five very different people prove that anyone can create a thriving newsletter as long as they are passionate about a certain topic. A commentary on all things pop culture with Hunter Harris Hunter Harris \u2014 a former entertainment writer at Vulture \u2014 quickly became popular through her witty recaps (aka \u201cPower Rankings\u201d) of the Roy family from HBO\u2019s Succession. Along with her journalism work, Hunter amassed a huge Twitter following by sharing her sharp commentary on the latest TV and film news and celebrity gossip. Rather than stay as a Staff Writer at Vulture, Hunter decided to create her own Substack in late 2020. hiiiii some personal news \u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728 a couple weeks ago i left vulture/nymag to build a newsletter at @SubstackInc . im so excited to introduce you to my new job, Hung Up \ud83d\udc97 https://t.co/ZZULTu6eZz \u2014 hunter harris (@hunteryharris) November 24, 2020 She wasn\u2019t the only journalist to do so. Culture reporter Anne Helen Peterson made a similar move when she left Buzzfeed to turn her semi-regular Sunday newsletter, Culture Study , into her full-time job. Both Harris and Petersen have shared how the move to Substack provided them with greater freedom to write what\u2019s most important to them. \u201cI was really nervous about starting it!\u201d Hunter said . \u201c ... But once I started brainstorming ideas and working with the designer on the logo, it kind of clicked into place: I can be even more myself than I could be for Vulture, which means, essentially, infinite posts about the movie Closer or Bennifer or why Martin Scorsese doesn\u2019t wear his glasses anymore.\u201d The focus of \"Hung Up\" is on celebrity and film news While the focus of \u201cHung Up,\u201d is on the latest pop culture news, Hunter discusses trending topics of all sorts, even politics. Her newsletter has been a huge success so far, and the writer has even been featured in other email newsletters like when she wrote a guest piece for fashion brand Reformation. While \"Hung Up,\" revolves around pop culture, Hunter sometimes discusses politics While \"Hung Up\" does have a free version, in order to read the entire newsletter followers have the option to pay $5 for a month or $50 for a yearly subscription. Hunter provides a sneak peak of the paid version of her email newsletter Not only has this become Hunter\u2019s full-time job, but the writer said she\u2019s also been able to take on more freelance writing gigs \u2013 something she didn\u2019t have the time for when she was a staff writer. Clearly, starting her own newsletter has been a win-win situation for the journalist. Emily\u2019s life plan for the week If you\u2019re a fan of Emily Mariko , you know that her brand is all about minimalism. While the influencer went viral on TikTok for her salmon rice bowl recipe in 2021, she first created her YouTube channel in 2012 sharing content around fitness and food. Unlike most other Influencers, Emily\u2019s Instagram Reels and TikToks are quiet. The YouTuber never adds music or voice-overs, and rarely even talks in her videos. Instead, viewers hear the chopping of vegetables, the clinking of pans, and the ignition of the stove. Rather than provide all of the details for her recipes in her videos, Emily sends a weekly newsletter with a rundown of the previous week\u2019s content, including full recipes and links to her cookware and outfits. Emily shares her weekly grocery list with readers Not only does \"Emily\u2019s life plan\" have a simple layout, but she also includes handwritten notes, which adds an authentic touch to the newsletter. The influencer provides a detailed look into her daily meals This newsletter is a great reminder that your content doesn\u2019t need to be exceptionally curated or polished. All that matters is that you share information that is useful and relevant to your audience. History lessons with the cultural tutor In May 2022, Sheehan Quirke , who goes by \u201cthe cultural tutor,\u201d quit his job and decided to make a Twitter account to share his passion for history with others. In just six weeks, he was able to amass over 100,000 followers. Six weeks ago I quit my job and set myself a challenge. Start a Twitter account. Share the things I care deeply about for at least 30 days. See what happens. And today I've hit 100k followers. Thank you. To all of you. Truly \ud83d\ude4f But this is just the beginning: \u2014 The Cultural Tutor (@culturaltutor) June 24, 2022 While Sheehan uses Twitter as a platform for discussing his interests \u2013 and has had many threads go viral \u2013 he also sends out a newsletter every Friday promising to deliver seven short lessons about art, history, and architecture to his followers\u2019 inboxes. The newsletter covers 7 short lessons each week The newsletter was initially free and gained 19,000 subscribers in its first few weeks. Now, however, Sheehan has included a paid option as he hopes to make the newsletter his full-time job. Users who subscribe for free will still receive a monthly newsletter and two essays a year but paid members will continue receiving weekly emails. Sheehan has stated on his website that he is even interested in starting a podcast as well. Sheehan discusses historical figures in each newsletter If you\u2019re passionate enough about a certain topic, like Shaheen is passionate about history and culture, a newsletter is a perfect way to organize your thoughts while also disseminating your knowledge to others. The fact that Shaheen was able to grow his following in such a short time without having any prior exposure, proves that people will gravitate towards your newsletter as long as your content is interesting and educational. Kat Boogard\u2019s freelancer tips Kat Boogard \u2014 a freelance writer who has been published in multiple outlets, including The New York Times \u2014 writes a newsletter specifically for other freelance writers. In her newsletter, Kat shares her experience with other writers and offers tips for freelancers to land paid writing opportunities. Kat provides specific examples for pitching publications in her newsletter Each week, Kat shares best practices and provides actionable advice for freelancers, like how to make their pitches the most effective.

Readers know they\u2019ll be learning more about freelance writing, making Kat\u2019s content a great resource for a specific demographic. Kat includes a round up of helpful links Along with sharing her own advice, Kat also includes a list of resources, freelance writing gigs, and highlights her top reads of the week. These additional sections are a great perk to an already useful newsletter. Joel\u2019s weekly newsletter with thoughts and highlights Our very own CEO, Joel Gascoigne , has recently started his own weekly newsletter where he shares updates about his personal life, Buffer, and highlights anything else that\u2019s top of mind for him. Joel shares an update with his readers In every newsletter, Joel focuses on a specific theme, with the most recent addition being about flexibility, specifically as to how it pertains to the four-day work week at Buffer. Each week, the newsletter focuses on a specific theme Also included every week is a roundup of articles, tweets, and quotes that have especially resonated with Joel. Joel includes a round up of links and quotes that resonated with him that week Joel has said that this newsletter is a way to build community and connect with others, and he even encourages readers to respond directly to him. Similarly, your newsletter doesn\u2019t only have to be a one-sided conversation but can also be a way for you to engage in open discussions with like-minded individuals. While starting your own newsletter from scratch may seem like a big undertaking, we hope the above examples have made the process seem more doable and inspired you to create your own. Whether you\u2019re commenting on trending topics, providing expert tips, or just sharing your favorite things \u2013 your newsletter can be successful as long as you talk about the things that matter most to you.

      "content_text": "One of the best things about TikTok is that it doesn't play favorites. Even new accounts can reach thousands, sometimes millions, of users. The idea of a \u201cwelcoming\u201d algorithm might feel strange to long-time creators and social media managers, but if there ever was one, it would be TikTok\u2019s. The social media platform is bursting with potential. With over 1.58 billion users spending nearly an hour every day on the app, chances are your audience is already waiting to discover \u2014 and follow \u2014 you. Now, follower count isn\u2019t everything. But it does open doors. It helps you build trust, unlock cool features like the TikTok Shop, and grow a loyal community that vibes with your content. In this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to get more followers on TikTok using 14 solid, no-fluff, actionable tips. Quick summary: How to get more followers on TikTok 1. Choose a niche \u2014 and stick to it 2. Understand your target audience 3. Write a clear and compelling bio 4. Build a content calendar to post consistently 5. Create trending content 6. Post when your audience is online 7. Focus on scroll-stopping hooks 8. End your videos with a clear call to action 9. Start a content series 10. Use relevant hashtags and keywords 11. Engage with your community 12. Collaborate with fellow creators or influencers 13. Experiment with different video lengths 14. Don't buy TikTok followers We're focusing on strategies that are genuinely practical and that we've seen work for creators like you. If you prefer watching over reading, we\u2019ve summarized the top five tips for you in video form, too: 1. Choose a niche \u2014 and stick to it It\u2019s tempting to try everything and see what works \u2014 especially on TikTok, where the possibilities can feel endless. But focusing on one niche can help you stand out more quickly. It tells the TikTok algorithm what your content is about It helps you filter your content ideas to a specific topic It helps you build authority and trust in your industry It makes you more memorable to TikTok users Kirsti Lang , a Senior Content Writer at Buffer, grew her following by over 1,000% in 30 days . One of her core learnings was that a niche (or a handful of connected niches) is immensely valuable for growing a loyal following. \u201cIf you do find a video you enjoy or find helpful in your FYP, you may tap over to the creator\u2019s profile to see if there are more,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if what you find there is a hot mess of all sorts of unrelated things, you\u2019re going to bounce back to the FYP without tapping \u2018follow\u2019 real fast.\u201d Annie-Mai Hodge , founder of Girl Power Marketing , agrees. \u201cPeople are wanting and searching for spaces and communities where they belong, where they can relate, and where they feel understood,\u201d she says. \u201cSo they\u2019re actively looking for creators who get them, or provide an experience for them like escaping \u2014 it\u2019s why #BookTok is so huge.\u201d If you feel constricted by having a singular niche, have a broad one that can fit multiple content pillars \u2014 quenching your desire for spontaneity and creativity without violating the algorithm\u2019s preference for cohesiveness. For example, Kirsti first posted about various topics: her job at Buffer, her love of Taylor Swift, and her fitness routine. But despite one of her Swiftie videos going viral , her watcher-to-follower conversion rate remained low. Her other videos about how to land a remote job did much better for that metric, even if they didn\u2019t go viral. @itsmekirsti Replying to @NikitaJade This is the exact process I would use to find a remote job from outside the U.S. if I was starting from scratch today! I wanted to follow up on my chaotic grwm video yesterday with something a little more structured \u2014 this is my step-by-step guide to finding and landing a remote job, particularly in the tech industry.  Screenshot my notes at the end of the video! Let me know if you have any questions. \ud83d\ude0a #remotejob #remotework #jobsearch #jobsearchtips #remotejobs #wfh \u266c My Frequency - Rickert Ponce \u201cThe Swifties were tapping over to my profile and didn\u2019t find a Taylor Swift fan account,\u201d she says. \u201cThe remote work video netted a very pleasing 70K views, and I earned a huge chunk of new followers \u2014 757, to be exact \u2014 and a much healthier conversation rate.\u201d Lessons learned: Going viral doesn\u2019t guarantee higher follower counts. You need a niche to establish yourself as an authority on the topic to gain followers and tell TikTok users (and the algorithm) what your TikTok account is about. If you\u2019re having too much trouble deciding what your niche will be, shift gears a little bit and think about who you\u2019re creating TikTok videos for. Which brings me to my next point. 2. Understand your target audience Having a solid understanding of who your target audience is and what they\u2019re looking for is the bedrock of getting more followers on all social media platforms, TikTok included. CEO of Fashivly , Ashlyn Greer , has grown the brand\u2019s TikTok account to over 100k followers . Her core principle has always been to use TikTok to resonate with her audience by understanding (and catering to) her audience\u2019s struggles. Take her video about sizing discrepancies in the fashion industry \u2014 it went viral because it struck a chord. @fashivly the chokehold these jeans had on us #greenscreen #greenscreenvideo #millennial \u266c original sound - fashivly \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to create inclusive content based on [audience] insights,\u201d she says. \u201cUnderstanding their pain points has guided our content creation and ensured we stay as inclusive as possible because we know this approach resonates with our audience.\u201d Solidifying your niche will lay the groundwork to help you pinpoint the segment of TikTok users you want to reach. The second step is doing your research to figure out your target audience\u2019s pain points and content preferences. Audience research tools like SparkToro or AnswerThePublic can help you find your audience\u2019s burning questions. But you can also work on understanding your target audience by spending time on TikTok and conducting a competitor analysis . For example, if you\u2019re a creator focusing on creating healthy vegan recipes: Search for \u201chealthy vegan recipes\u201d on TikTok and see what pops up Analyze the best-performing TikTok videos and creators to understand what topics they\u2019re creating videos on and which are resonating Pay attention to the comments on your fellow creators\u2019 videos to dive even further into your audience\u2019s questions, preferences, and recommendations Understanding your target audience is an ongoing endeavor rather than a one-off task. The more you post (and experiment!), the more feedback you get \u2014 in comments, direct messages (DMs), and your TikTok analytics . 3. Write a clear and compelling bio Your potential followers on TikTok will likely discover your content in the For You Page (FYP). But they might often navigate to your TikTok profile to learn more about who you are and what you post about. If your TikTok bio is empty, you\u2019re leaving valuable space that could work to get you more followers. Your bio should tell what content you create \u2014 establish your niche and your unique selling point. Instead of making it about you though, focus on your audience and make it about them. For example, Parker York Smith\u2019s bio says, \u201cHelping you look good and feel confident,\u201d which is an instant value prop for why you should follow him. While you\u2019re at it, also ensure that your TikTok profile is up to date \u2014 have a clear profile picture and an easy-to-read username. All of the factors in your profile will work together to help build trust and make it tempting to follow you. 4. Build a content calendar to post consistently TikTok, like all other social media platforms, loves consistency. The ideal posting frequency for TikTok is two short-form videos a day. But take that number with a grain of salt. You can adjust this based on your capacity \u2014 more important to maintain the quality of your TikTok videos. Kirsti, for example, has seen solid audience growth with two or three videos a month. A smart way to increase your posting cadence without burning out is to repurpose your content . If you already have a YouTube channel, for instance, you can chop up some videos from there to post on your TikTok account. You can also shoot b-roll in bulk (hello, content batching ) and reuse it for future videos. Alice Kim , founder of PerfectDD , used TikTok to generate $25,000 in sales for her business in a month . She found that many of her old videos would resurface to new TikTok users, thanks to the algorithm. Having a consistent branding (alongside regular posting) helped her immensely in this scenario. \u201cI\u2019ve found consistency in messaging is more important than consistency of posting,\u201d she says. \u201cThis means that any of my videos could be seen by a new potential customer at any time.\u201d \"That\u2019s why I\u2019m unafraid to reiterate my brand promise and message over and over again, so people who are new to my videos always know what PerfectDD is all about.\u201d The easiest way to maintain a consistent posting schedule is by creating a content calendar and using a tool like Buffer to automate posting (Buffer also doubles as a content calendar \u2014 so you don\u2019t need both!). This way, you can visually spot your content gaps and fill them. Remember to leave some room in that content calendar for trending content. 5. Create trending content Let\u2019s be clear: Trending content isn\u2019t a magic bullet to increase your TikTok followers. But it can help you become more visible on the For You Page \u2014 which can, by extension, help you get more followers on TikTok. Some examples of TikTok trends: Sounds: Use trending audio clips to join popular conversations. Hashtags: Add trending hashtags to help your videos get discovered. Challenges: Participate in viral challenge videos to reach new audiences. Niche trends: Trends related to a specific news or event in your niche. While creating your content calendar, leave some gaps for trending videos. Or you could treat the",

      "content_text": "How do you know the number of likes, comments, and shares you\u2019re getting is good enough? Your social media results don\u2019t exist in a silo. To get the full picture, you need to compare your metrics to other businesses that look like yours. This article will delve into social media benchmarks for various industries and platforms. I\u2019ve used data from the following reports: Buffer\u2019s best times to post on social media \u2014 which analyzed one million posts sent through Buffer RivalIQ\u2019s 2024 social media industry benchmark report \u2014 which analyzed 2,100 from over 14 industries Buffer\u2019s best content for major social media platforms \u2014 which analyzed one million posts sent through Buffer \u26a0\ufe0f Remember that each research analyzes different companies and has varying numbers of posts \u2014 so the metrics you read here are a guideline, not a commandment. What do social media industry benchmarks mean? Social media industry benchmarks are a lever against which you can measure your own performance . Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a small business in the education industry on TikTok. If your engagement rate is at par with most other educational small businesses on TikTok, you can feel confident in your social media strategy . You\u2019ll double down on what you\u2019re already doing and witness a steady return-on-investment (ROI) . If you were looking at your engagement rate in a silo, you would\u2019ve no benchmark to compare it to \u2014 except your own past performance. While that\u2019s certainly useful, it\u2019s not enough. How can you understand the scope of your improvement if you have no other data to compare your results to? Maybe your engagement rate is better than last quarter, but it\u2019s still significantly lower than others in your industry. Knowing this fact can help you address the problem and determine where you can get better results. Social media benchmarks help you see your performance in full context. Knowing the industry standard can help you set ambitious but achievable goals, report a 360-degree picture to leadership, and pinpoint areas of growth. Which social media metrics should you care about? The X-axis is your industry. Which metrics should you look for in the Y-axis? Here are four social media marketing metrics you should care about: 1: Engagement rate Engagement rate is typically calculated as the total number of likes, comments, and shares divided by the total number of followers multiplied by 100. Why should you care about social media engagement rate? The number of interactions your posts receive determines whether your target audience resonates with your social media content. The higher the engagement rate, the more your followers like your social media posts. 2: Post type Many social networks today have a ton of content formats \u2014 images, carousels, videos, etc. Understanding which type of post works best for which platform helps you repurpose content efficiently and prioritize the right type of content types for your social media calendar . 3: Posting frequency Posting frequency is the number of times you should post on a social media platform. There\u2019s an ideal post frequency for every network to get the most engagement, but it\u2019s not always consistent across industries. Some niches might need to post more because their industry has a lot of competition on social media, while others might not need to be so strict with how often they post. 4: Posting times There\u2019s no universal right time to post on social media, but there are certain times when you might get more engagement than others \u2014 just because the algorithm supports it. Benchmark data helps you understand the \u201cbest time to post\u201d patterns spotted from millions of posts. While these are the four key metrics I\u2019ve shared above, the benchmark data you care for can vary depending on your social media goals . For example, if your goal is to increase your follower count, you might also care about doing a competitive analysis of follower growth in your industry. If your aim is to improve brand awareness, you might also want to monitor impressions and reach. Breaking down social media benchmarks by platform & industry I\u2019ll break down the social media benchmarks for various industries for the most popular social media sites . Social media benchmarks for Facebook Best time to post 10AM on Fridays Best type of post Video Median number of posts (weekly) 4.69 Median engagement rate (in percent) 0.063 The best time to post on Facebook is 10 AM on a Friday, according to Buffer\u2019s analysis of a million posts. According to another one of Buffer\u2019s posts, video gets the most engagement on Facebook. Brands are posting 4.69 times weekly on Facebook, according to RivalIQ. Companies in the media industry post the most, followed by sports. RivalIQ\u2019s engagement rate was not in alignment with the posting frequency . Despite posting the most often, brands in the media industry don\u2019t get the highest engagement rate (0.04 percent). Sports teams get the highest engagement, followed by influencers and higher education. The median engagement rate across all industries is 0.063 percent. Takeaway : Since the posting frequency isn\u2019t correlated to the engagement rate, it\u2019s clear increasing your Facebook engagement is more about doubling down on quality than quantity. If your target audience is on Facebook, don\u2019t spam them with a large number of posts. Instead, try to post more of the content they like and build a community via Facebook Groups . Social media benchmarks for Instagram Best time to post 7\u20138 AM on weekdays Best type of post Instagram Reels Median number of posts (weekly) 4.7 Median engagement rate (in percent) 0.43 Buffer\u2019s analysis found the best time to post on Instagram is 7\u20138 AM on weekdays. And another one of Buffer\u2019s research of over 12 million (!) Instagram posts found the best type of content format is Instagram Reels . While videos are certainly Instagram algorithm\u2019s favorite, carousel posts and single-image feeds nearly get the same engagement. In general, RivalIQ\u2019s report found brands are getting a 0.43 percent engagement rate on Instagram. Higher education brands get the most engagement, followed by sports companies and influencers. To get this engagement, brands are posting 4.7 times a week, according to RivalIQ. Here, the number of posts is somewhat correlated to the engagement rate. Sports teams post the most often (18 times weekly). The posting frequency doesn\u2019t lead to high engagement rates in other industries. Takeaway : Educational content via video gets the most engagement on Instagram. Create Instagram Reels ideas centering informational and tutorial content to help your audience solve a pain point. Social media benchmarks for TikTok Best time to post 4\u20135 PM on weekdays Best type of post Not available (but a small experiment suggests videos still rule) Median number of posts (weekly) 1.92 Median engagement rate (in percent) 2.63 Buffer found the best time to post on TikTok is mid-week between 4\u20135 PM. You can post slideshows and static images on TikTok along with videos. But there haven\u2019t been many research studies examining which types of posts perform best on the platform. A small experiment by Emily Hessney Lynch found that videos still outperformed slideshows. So, the best way to increase your TikTok followers is to double down on video content. Media industry posts the most on TikTok (7.1 times weekly), according to RivalIQ. The median posting frequency for TikTok is 1.92 videos per week. The engagement rate is the highest for TikTok at 2.63 percent. Higher education takes the cake here, too \u2014 with a 9.23 percent engagement rate. Sports, food & beverage, and the travel industry also shine on TikTok. Takeaway : TikTok has one of the highest engagement rates in all industries. Try achieving a consistent posting schedule on this platform to get the most bang for your buck. Two videos a day are more than enough. Social media benchmarks for Twitter (now X) Best time to post 11 AM on Mondays and Fridays Best type of post Video Median number of posts (weekly) 3.31 Median engagement rate (in percent) 0.029 An analysis of a million posts by Buffer found the best time to post on Twitter (now X) is 11 AM on Mondays and Fridays. Buffer also found that the X algorithm prioritizes video \u2014 since they get the most engagement on the platform. Brands are posting 3.31 tweets per week on X, says RivalIQ\u2019s analysis. Media takes the lead here (by a lot!), followed by sports and nonprofits. The engagement rate on X (according to RivalIQ) is a median of 0.029 percent. Sports teams get the most engagement, followed by higher education and nonprofits. Takeaway : Twitter (now X) is starting to prefer video content. If you\u2019re already creating videos for TikTok or Instagram, repurpose them for X. This platform doesn\u2019t boast a very high engagement rate, but posting more might help you improve your performance. Social media benchmarks for LinkedIn Best time to post 9 AM \u2013 5 PM on weekdays Best type of post Video Median number of posts (weekly) 3.3 Median engagement rate (in percent) 4.73 It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the best time to post on LinkedIn is during working hours. Buffer\u2019s analysis of 5.5 million posts found posts that go live between 9\u20135 on weekdays perform the best. And the lovable personal-branding platform is no different from other social networks in favoring videos. Buffer\u2019s research found they get the most engagement. However, the difference wasn\u2019t huge \u2014 picture posts and LinkedIn carousels nearly get the same engagement as video posts on LinkedIn. RivalIQ published a separate 2024 LinkedIn benchmark report analyzing 372 handles and 58,000 posts. It found the average engagement rate among brands was 4.73 percent. To achieve this engagement rate, companies were posting 3.3 times a week. Unfortunately, RivalIQ didn\u2019t provide an industry-level breakdown of how many times each industry posts on LinkedIn and what engagement rate various niches are witnessing. Takeaway : Like Facebook, LinkedIn loves qual",

      "content_text": "There are many factors to consider when posting on Instagram, but the one that often feels like a make-or-break decision is when to post your content. Totally fair. You don\u2019t want to pour hours into a post, only to share it in an Instagram dead zone and hear\u2026 crickets. Finding the best time to post can make the difference between silence and Instagram success. Sharing Instagram Stories , reels , feed posts, and carousels at optimal times for reach and maximum engagement is an important consideration in your social media strategy. If your content immediately makes it to your target audience's feed while they're around to engage with it, it's more likely to succeed. That's why we analyzed the reach of over 2 million Instagram posts to determine the best time to post on Instagram \u2014 backed by real-world data. With all that in mind, let's dig into everything you need to know about the best time to post on Instagram. We'll also cover how to figure out your personal best time to post for maximum engagement and reach, whether you're a marketer, creator, influencer, or casual Instagrammer.

There's no universal best time to post on Instagram for guaranteed success. If only it were that easy! However, our analysis showed us that certain days and times tend to yield more reach than others. What was really interesting was the patterns we uncovered, too. For example, most weekdays see similar high-reach times. Timing isn\u2019t as critical as it was in the chronological-feed days (R.I.P.), but it still plays a role in your social media marketing strategy . Phew! Ready to dig into the numbers and uncover the best time to post on Instagram based on our research? \u26a1 Schedule your Instagram posts, carousels, stories, and reels. Buffer makes it easy to test and discover your own best time to post on Instagram. The best times to post on Instagram The best time to post on Instagram is generally 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays. After analyzing more than 2 million Instagram posts, we found that posts shared at these times tended to get the most reach. According to Statista , 31.7% of 18 to 24-year-olds and 30.6% of 25 to 34-year-olds (i.e. folks with nine-to-five jobs) use the app. So, most Instagram users are 18\u201334. They\u2019re usually online in the evenings after work \u2014 prime time for posting. I know I'm definitely more likely to log on as the day wears on and my productivity dwindles, or spend time scrolling as I relax in the evening. Early mornings are not optimal times for catching this crowd. There's a slight uptick in reach from around 12 p.m. on most weekdays. (Lunch breaks, for sure.) It makes sense that 3 p.m. often emerges as the best time to post for many accounts. You might wonder, \u2018But aren\u2019t people still at work at 3 p.m.?\u2019 True \u2014 but remember, these numbers show reach, not log-in times. A post at 3 p.m. often travels through feeds and peaks later in the evening. Your content will likely percolate for a few hours in various feeds, so posts shared in these slots will likely be shared just in time for the peak evening slots. Definitely worth considering as part of your posting strategy. As you'll see from the heatmap graph above, the best Instagram posting times are pretty predictable, depending on the day of the week. The darkest slots represent the time slots with the highest reach per follower count \u2014 indicating the best time to post on Instagram. The light-colored to white blocks are the time slots with the lowest reach, showing the posting times that are best avoided if you're after maximum engagement and reach. On weekdays, reach starts to pick up, which directly influences the best time to post on Instagram for maximum engagement. Prime times start in the early morning at 6 a.m., climbing from 11 a.m. (just in time for lunch breaks) and peaking at around 3 p.m. on most days. Weekends look different. Mornings are slow, and reach dips on both Saturday and Sunday. Evenings bring a small bump, but not as strong as weekdays. If weekends are part of your strategy, 6 p.m. is generally the best time to post for catching evening scrollers. The best time to post on Instagram on weekends is 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. \ud83c\udf0f No timezone troubles: To make this data easier to understand, our data scientist Bufferoo has done some mathematical magic to make the recommended time zones universally applicable. In other words, no need to convert. Whether you're in EST (Eastern Standard Time), PST (Pacific Standard Time), or IST (Indian Standard Time), the times apply to you. The best time to post on Instagram at a glance Monday: The best times to post on Instagram on Monday are 3 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. Tuesday: The best times to post on Instagram on Tuesday are 3 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. Wednesday: The best times to post on Instagram on Wednesday are 3 p.m., 2 p.m., and 5 p.m. Thursday: The best times to post on Instagram on Thursday are 3 p.m., 4 p.m., and 2 p.m. Friday: The best times to post on Instagram on Friday are 3 p.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. Saturday: The best times to post on Instagram on Saturday are 6 p.m., 3 p.m., and 2 p.m. Sunday: The best times to post on Instagram on Sunday are 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 2 p.m. The best time to post on Instagram for every day of the week Here's a closer look at the best Instagram posting times for maximum engagement and reach, day by day. The best time to post on Instagram on Monday The best time to post on Instagram on Monday is at 3 p.m. , when reach on posts shared tends to be highest. 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. also tend to see higher reach and are great times to schedule posts. Definitely add these posting times into your Instagram strategy. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesday The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesday is at 3 p.m. Patterns are similar to reach on Monday, with another (slightly lower) top posting times peak at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. The best time to post on Instagram on Wednesday The best time to post on Instagram on Wednesday is also at 3 p.m. Other good times to schedule posts on Instagram are 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. You'll want to avoid the early morning in your posting schedule on Wednesday. The best time to post on Instagram on Thursday The best time to post on Instagram on Thursday is 3 p.m. , very closely followed more great posting times at 4 p.m. and 2 p.m. The best time to post on Instagram on Friday The best times to post on Instagram on Friday are at 3 p.m. 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. are also optimal posting times. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturday The best time to post on Instagram on Saturday is 6 p.m., though it's worth noting that Saturday reach pales in comparison to weekdays. That said, there are some solid options to post on Instagram at 3 p.m. and 2 p.m., too. The best time to post on Instagram on Sunday The best time to post on Instagram on Sunday is in the early evening, from 5 p.m . to 6 p.m. Sunday is also a quiet time on the app, and perhaps not the best day to include in your posting schedule. It's best not to schedule Instagram posts for the early morning or early afternoon on Sunday. This is where social media management tools like Buffer really shine. Experiment by systematically going through the best time to post on the list above. Schedule posts at these times and track their performance to see what time to post on Instagram to reach your target audience. What is the best day of the week to post on Instagram? You really can't go wrong with sharing content on Instagram on weekdays. But Monday and Friday are the best days to post on Instagram \u2014\u00a0an inch about the rest of the week for social media performance. Comparatively, the worst time of the week to post on Instagram is on a Sunday. What is the best time to post reels on Instagram? The best time to post Instagram reels is between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays. In our analysis, we reviewed all Instagram posts, rather than segmenting by post type for maximum engagement. That said, it's also worth considering that people treat different segments of the Instagram app a little differently. An update on the algorithm by Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri offers some interesting insight on this front. \u201cPeople tend to look for their closest friends in stories, use explore to discover new content and creators, and be entertained in reels,\u201d he said in a reel. It stands to reason, then, that people are looking to be entertained at certain times of day, and catch up with friends, family, and their favorite creators at other times. We recommend you post reels during the optimal posting times in the evening. Your followers will have slightly more time to scroll and enjoy your Instagram Reels before bedtime, making it a great time to post on Instagram. The best type of content to post on Instagram This probably won't surprise you \u2014\u00a0the best content on Instagram for reach is video. Our data revealed that videos perform far better than carousels and photo posts. Reels are your best bet for growth \u2014 even Instagram says so. Carly Lynn , Instagram\u2019s Head of Creator Partnerships, puts it plainly : \u2018The most effective way to grow is to consistently create engaging reels.\" That's not to say other content types don't have a",

(Even the non-music sounds from TikTok tend to get stuck in my head, but I digress\u2026) The catchiness of these tunes is incredibly powerful for creators and brands on the social media platform to tap into, because not only do users remember the song \u2014 chances are, videos that featured the track will probably stick in their minds, too. Beyond memorability, of course, is the algorithmic effect of being right on the cusp of a trending TikTok song. And who would say no to a little boost for the content they worked so hard on? In this post, I\u2019ll share the most viral songs and sounds on TikTok in 2025 \u2014 and how to use them to boost your content. Jump to a section: Why trending songs matter on TikTok How to find trending songs on TikTok 13 Trending TikTok songs and sounds Why trending TikTok sounds matter Since you\u2019re here, I probably don\u2019t need to tell you that using a hot sound on TikTok can increase your chances of landing on the For You Page, especially if you\u2019re early to the trend. TikTok\u2019s algorithm often prioritizes familiarity and repeatability, so when a song is on the rise, jumping on it can give your post more visibility. For example, if I\u2019m scrolling through my FYP and watch a video with a particular audio, the TikTok algorithm will likely test the waters with another video that uses the same sound a couple of videos later. The algorithm wants to understand exactly why I lingered on the first video. Was it the music? If yes \u2014 boy, does the FYP have more where that came from. The right TikTok sounds or songs can instantly set the tone, spark emotion, or cue a punchline for your audience \u2014 particularly if the sound, like many of the ones below, has been used in a specific way. The songs or audio that rise to that level of virality that they become a moment in time for internet culture are the really special ones. Very demure, very mindful, no? All that said: you don't need to spend hours scrolling to find the right audio for your next post. Here are the most popular TikTok songs and audio right now, updated in October 2025.

      "content_text": "You already know your Facebook insights are crucial for nudging your Facebook marketing strategy in the right direction. Facebook analytics give you the performance numbers you need to: Optimize your ad spend Improve the reach of your organic posts Give statistics you can report to stakeholders \u2026And more But Facebook bid adios to its native Facebook analytics tool (and the Facebook audience insights tool ) in 2021. How do you get your Facebook analytics now? This article will tell you everything you need to know to measure your Facebook performance and get valuable insights. \u26a0\ufe0f Note : You need to have a Facebook Business Page for your small business or a Facebook profile in professional mode to access Facebook analytics and insights. Personal Facebook accounts don\u2019t serve the marketing function and thus have little to no insights data available. What\u2019s the difference between Facebook analytics and Facebook insights? First things first: What\u2019s the difference between Facebook analytics and Facebook insights ? Facebook analytics refer to the raw numbers, data, and performance statistics Facebook insights refer to the learnings you derive from the above analytics For example, let\u2019s say you collate all your best-performing Facebook posts by finding all the content with the most engagement and reach. Here, you\u2019re using Facebook analytics (likes, comments, shares, impressions, etc.) to determine which posts qualify as \u2018best-performing\u2019. After this collection, suppose you spot a pattern where most top performing posts were user-generated content . This is a Facebook insight you derived from your analytics. Facebook offers raw analytics and some insights via its native tools. But you can also use third-party social media analysis tools to take a deeper dive into your performance metrics. How to derive Facebook insights from 4 native Meta tools Meta sunsetted its Facebook analytics tool to consolidate data from its other networks (like Instagram) all in one place. Now, you can view your Facebook Page performance in four ways inside Meta: 1. Professional dashboard 2. Meta business suite (only for Facebook Pages) 3. Meta ads manager (only if you run Facebook ads) 4. Facebook group insights (if you have a Facebook group) 1: Professional dashboard The Professional dashboard is available for creators with professional mode on their Facebook profiles turned on and for Facebook Page insights. It contains simple surface-level Facebook analytics. If you\u2019re looking for some quick insight into how your Facebook marketing is going, this is the best place to look at. Inside the \u201cProfessional dashboard,\u201d you\u2019ll find an \u201cInsight\u201d tab containing four tabs: 1. Home : This section is a basic performance overview of your Page or profile for the past 28 days. You can see key metrics like overall page posts, total reach, page views, engagement, new followers, new page likes, recent content, and some basic info about your audience. 2. Your Page/Profile : Insights under this tab contain post reach, engagement, new followers, unfollows, and total interactions (likes, comments, shares, views, clicks) for the past 28 days. 3. Content : This page contains the public posts you\u2019ve shared in the past 90 days (or you can filter for the past 7, 28, or 60 days) and how they\u2019re performing individually. 4. Audience : Here, you can see fundamental demographic data (gender, age, and location) about the audience interacting with your Facebook Page or profile. The professional dashboard is excellent if you simply want to do a quick flip-through of your Facebook posts\u2019 performance. It\u2019s not the most in-depth source of information, but it can get the ball rolling and is handy when you\u2019re short on time. It\u2019s best to visit the professional dashboard regularly to stay in the loop on how your posts are performing and what audience demographics are interacting with your Page/profile. 2: Meta business suite Meta business suite replaced Facebook analytics to become the source of native Facebook page insights. Facebook profiles with professional mode turned on don\u2019t work inside Meta business suite at the time of writing this article. The Meta business suite helps with many things (like unifying your inbox, scheduling content on Facebook and Instagram, etc.) including extracting in-depth Facebook analytics and insights into your organic and paid content on the platform. As soon as you log in to your Meta business suite, you\u2019ll find an \u201cInsights\u201d section on the left menu. Within insights, eight tabs contain extensive and in-depth info on your Facebook performance: 1. Overview : This subsection contains the basic info on your Facebook Page insights. It includes daily and cumulative insights into how much reach you\u2019ve gotten from your Facebook posts. The same tab also breaks down the reach numbers into 3-minute views, 1-minute views, minutes viewed, and content interactions on the X-axis and from followers & non-followers on the Y-axis. Image Source 2. Plan : Here, Facebook helps you set goals and complete basic tasks it recommends to set yourself up for success \u2014 like the number of times you should post, setting up admins, etc. It\u2019s a good tab to monitor in the beginning to understand Meta\u2019s expectations and the features it offers. 3. Results : This section helps you understand Facebook reach, Page views, follows, and ad performance over your selected timeline. It\u2019s excellent for monitoring whether your Facebook analytics are increasing or decreasing over time. You can also come here to export these graphs for reporting to stakeholders. Image Source 4. Audience : When Meta shut down Facebook Audience Insights, it didn\u2019t eradicate it completely. Instead, Meta merged it into the business suite so you can continue to extract the granular details about your followers on Facebook. This tab contains: Trends : This tab shows metrics such as how your followers are increasing or decreasing, returning viewers, engaged followers over the timeline you\u2019ve set. It also shows when you should post on Facebook by displaying the your audience\u2019s most active times. Segments : Your target audience is divided into people who engage, follow, and message your Facebook Page. You can get insights into all these individual segments. Demographics : This is where you can see a breakdown of your audience\u2019s demographic data \u2014 their age, gender, and location. Potential audience : Here, you can add filters on who your ideal customer already is (where do they live? What\u2019s their age? and more) and understand the number of people you can reach via your Facebook Page.

Messaging : If you practice any form of customer service via your Facebook Page , this section is a goldmine. You can see how many people contacted you via direct messages (DMs) , admins data, number of people who were returning contacts, your response time , and how many of your Facebook conversations converted into booked appointments (if you use that feature ). 6. Benchmarking : This is the place where you can compare your Facebook performance to businesses that look like yours. You can either add your industry and evaluate insights like your comparative social media frequency to other companies in the same niche, your total followers & engagement vs. theirs, etc. This is in the \u201cBusiness comparison\u201d header. Or, you can also add specific competitors and their Facebook Page(s) to compare your Facebook analytics to theirs. This is in the \u201cBusinesses to watch\u201d header. Image Source 7. Overview (under \u201cContent\u201d) : In this section, you can draw minute insights into every single Facebook post \u2014 from Facebook Reels to Facebook Stories . You can see your top content formats, audience retention, and also breakdown this data to compare organic vs. paid or followers vs. non-followers. Image Source 8. Content : Here, you can build customized performance charts by filtering for posts or Stories or both, media types, and marketing channels (organic or paid) on one side. (If you\u2019re also running an Instagram marketing strategy, you can add that to the graph to get a cumulative performance chart.) For the other side, you can choose from a plethora of Facebook analytics like impressions, reach, replies, sticker taps, etc. Meta business suite is an excellent place for Facebook analytics, but it can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning. Converting these analytics to actionable Facebook insights also requires some work and practice. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more about the Meta business suite in our extensive guide . 3: Meta ads manager If you\u2019ve created ads on Facebook , you need insight into how they\u2019re performing to calculate and improve your return on investment (ROI) . The Meta ads manager helps you do just that. Note : Facebook ads manager and Meta ads manager are the same thing. After you\u2019ve run your ad campaigns on Facebook, the Meta ads manager can give you extensive statistics into how they\u2019re received in the wild. There are two tabs in the Facebook ad manager: 1. The overview tab gives you basic metrics of reach, impressions, link clicks, cost per thousand impressions (CPM), click through rates, etc., for all your ad campaigns in a table format right next to your campaign name. You can add filters using the drop-down menu to customize this data and find exactly what you\u2019re looking for. 2. The ad reporting dashboard enables you to do the exact same thing. You can apply various filters to customize rows and columns \u2014 except here, you can also export them as a CSV file or a shareable link. You can also make this a recurring report by duplicating the analytics and switching the timeline. \ud83d\udca1 Want to learn more about using the Meta ads manager?

      "content_text": "Quick: which social network is bringing in the most traffic to your website right now? It\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t know off the top of your head. (I don\u2019t memorize that sort of stuff either!) But wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could pull up the answer in just a few seconds whenever your boss asks you this? What about revenue broken down by social network? What about the percentage of traffic generated by social versus email ? You can track it all, and you can track it for free: all you need are an analytics tool (like Google Analytics, Hotjar, or Mixpanel) and UTM codes. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the magic of UTM codes and how I use them in my own digital marketing work. \ud83d\udca1 Looking for a simple way to create your own UTMs for an upcoming marketing campaign? Try Buffer's free online UTM builder \u2014 there are no limits, and it'll stay 100 percent free, always. A simple overview of UTM codes Here's a lightweight beginner's guide to the world of UTM tracking links. What are UTM codes? UTM stands for \u201cUrchin tracking module.\u201d Google acquired Urchin Software Corporation in 2005, and their software laid the groundwork for what we now know as Google Analytics. UTM codes are snippets of text you can add to the end of a URL that tell Google Analytics (and other analytics tools) a little bit more information about each link. Here\u2019s a sample of what one looks like: Why are UTMs important? As a social media manager , content creator, or small business owner, you\u2019re likely sharing scores of links across several social channels as part of your digital marketing efforts every month. Yes, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and the like can give you a general, high-level idea of your top traffic sources.\u00a0But what about when you want to get specific ? UTM links help you track the performance of each of those links so you can see exactly where your traffic is coming from. You can use the UTM parameters \u2014 the short tags within the UTM link, which we'll discuss below \u2014 to track big-picture info, like how much traffic you\u2019re getting from certain social media platforms . You can use them to track the details, too, like how much revenue you get from an ad campaign, the competing performance of a new call to action (CTA), or how much traction you get from a creator you\u2019ve worked with as part of an influencer marketing campaign. There are many, many ways to track clicks with UTM links. The key to accurately analyzing your social media marketing efforts with UTM codes is consistency . If you create a template for your tracking parameters and stick to it, you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of time (and headaches!) in the future. I\u2019m about to share an approach to UTM tagging that has been especially helpful for me when it comes to measuring the success of my links. I hope it will be for you, too! But before we jump into that, let\u2019s quickly set our expectations for what a well-tagged URL can accomplish for you. 3 essential questions UTM tracking can answer When all UTM\u2019ed up, a link should be able to help you answer some basic questions about your website traffic: Where is the traffic coming from? How is it getting to me? Why is it coming to me? Essentially, UTM tracking codes tell the story of how your traffic is coming to you. This works by using several elements called UTM parameters , which we\u2019ll cover in detail below. The essential ones are: Source Medium Campaign That\u2019s why a UTM-tagged URL looks like this: https://buffer.com/email-courses/actionable-social-media-strategies/?utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=post-original&utm_content=-image&utm_campaign=25-social-media-strategies See all those \u201cutm_\u201d bits? That\u2019s where we\u2019re labeling the traffic that comes from this link. Of course, typing that long string of characters is pretty scary, so most people use UTM generators . These nifty tools let you plug in the values for each of those parameters, and then the tools do the magic of stringing them together into a nice URL. Some popular generators include: Buffer's free UTM Builder Google\u2019s URL Builder UTM.io\u2019s Chrome extension The Buffer in-app link shortener The UTM parameters, in turn, tell Google Analytics (or whatever tool you use) how to sort your incoming website traffic. If you\u2019re tracking your links across social media (and across the rest of your digital content), you\u2019ll be able to really drill down on which content is performing best and where. It\u2019s worth noting that there are several optional tags you can use in your UTM tracking, along with source, medium, and campaign: Campaign term (to help you track paid search keywords if you\u2019re running search ads) Campaign content (for multiple links to the same landing page \u2014 good for things like A/B testing two different banners) New tags with Google Analytics 4 (GA4): utm_id: (for a specific campaign, which is necessary in GA4 for importing some data from Google Ads.) and utm_source_platform: (to pinpoint the platform directing traffic to a given Analytics property). It\u2019s worth getting to grips with the three required UTM tags before you start to use these additional parameters. The good news, though, is that once you have the hang of source, medium, and campaign, adding in the others will be a breeze. Let\u2019s look at how to use UTM codes and parameters in your social media links. How to use UTM codes and parameters in your social media links With UTM codes, we\u2019re trying to help Google Analytics and other tools tell us the story of how our social media traffic is getting to us. We\u2019re trying to answer three questions: Where\u2019s the traffic coming from? How is it coming to me? Why is it coming to me? The good news? Choosing your UTM parameters is as simple as answering those questions for every link you publish. Let\u2019s look at how that works together. 1. How to use the \u2018source\u2019 UTM parameter in social media You can use the name of the social platform you\u2019re sharing the link to (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook) as the source UTM tag. The source parameter is about answering the question: \u201cWhere is my traffic coming from?\u201d By adding the parameter &utm_source= to your links, you\u2019re tagging every visit that comes from that link in a way that says, \u201cThis visit came from X.\u201d So, your source UTM parameter will simply state where the traffic is coming from. Now, I say \u201csimply,\u201d but there are many ways to do this. For example, if you were tweeting to your followers about a great blog post you just wrote, you could answer the question \u201cWhere is the traffic going to come from?\u201d a few ways. It\u2019s coming from you, the sharer. It\u2019s coming from X (Twitter), where it\u2019s being shared. It\u2019s coming from your followers, the ones reading it. There are all kinds of ways you could think about this. But Google recommends using the \u201csource\u201d field to describe the \u201creferrer\u201d or the entity sending the traffic your way. In this example, a good source tag would be simply \u201cLinkedIn.\u201d There are a few good reasons for this: You will eventually want to track ALL of your traffic from LinkedIn in one place In the case of social media links, this makes even more sense. If someone shares or reposts your links, the traffic isn\u2019t really coming from you anymore \u2014 but it\u2019s still coming from the same social media platform. In social media, I\u2019ve found the most straightforward approach is to use the social platform you\u2019re sharing the link to as the source UTM tag. When I share a link to Facebook, it is tagged with \u201c &utm_source=facebook \u201d. 2. How to use the \u2018medium\u2019 UTM parameter in social media Consider setting \u201csocial\u201d as your medium tag for all links shared on social media. This parameter is all about answering the question: \u201cHow is my traffic coming to me?\u201d By adding the parameter &utm_medium= to your links, you\u2019re tagging every visit that comes from that link in a way that says, \u201cThis visit came via Y.\u201d This is a little less straightforward than the source tag we looked at because, for every way to describe where the traffic is coming from, there are probably ten ways to explain how it\u2019s getting to you. That\u2019s why it can be helpful to establish some UTM conventions up front. If you give yourself a general list of options for the medium tag, then this part of the link-tracking process can be a lot easier. Google suggests using a general name of the marketing medium for this parameter on their Campaign URL Builder , like \u201ccpc\u201d, \u201cbanner\u201d, or \u201cemail\u201d. That helps keep things straightforward. For tagging UTM codes on social media, a straightforward approach is to always use \u201csocial\u201d as your medium. You don\u2019t have to do this, but I\u2019ve found it makes it very easy to sort the traffic in my high-level marketing channels \u2014 especially if I\u2019m taking Google\u2019s advice on this when I\u2019m tagging other links. Just FYI, here are some other medium tags you might consider for non-social links: \u201cEmail\u201d for email marketing campaigns or email newsletters \u201cBlog\u201d for your content marketing resources Blog-guest (for when you\u2019re guest posting on an influencer\u2019s blog) Blog-syndicated (for when you\u2019re sharing your articles with syndication sites) 3. How to use the \u2018campaign\u2019 UTM parameter in social media Now for the last of the questions: \u201cWhy is the traffic coming to you?\u201d This is what the campaign UTM parameter is all about. By adding the parameter &utm_campaign= to your links, you\u2019re tagging every visit that comes from that link in a way that says, \u201cThis traffic is coming from This.\u201d There are so many ways to use this tag. The beauty is that if you\u2019re consistent with the naming conventions for your source and medium UTM parameters, you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to tracking campaigns. Here are a few ways to think of using the campaign parameter: Use it for special promotions. Doing a new product launch? Try \u201claunch-[Product Name]\u201d as your campaign name. Use it for personas. If a post is crafted especially for one buyer persona, consider tagging that link accordingly. For example, you could try \u201cmanager-mandy\u201d or \u201cpractitioner-pam\u201d as your campaign values. Use it for busine",

      "content_text": "Spend five minutes on the \u201chow to grow\u201d side of TikTok, and you\u2019ll quickly learn one thing: if you\u2019re not posting multiple times a day, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Or so the algorithm experts say. As a fledgling TikTok creator , I\u2019ve always been a bit sceptical of this advice. I managed to build a small audience within about a year by posting a couple of times a month, rather than daily. But\u2026 would I have been able to get more views on TikTok if I had? I put the question to Buffer\u2019s data scientist, Julian Winternheimer. And because he never does anything by halves, Julian analyzed a massive dataset to find the answer: 11.4 million TikTok posts from over 150,000 accounts . We (by we, I mean Julian) went full science on this 2025 TikTok Study : running fixed-effects regressions and Z-score analyses to control for account size and performance differences. The goal: To understand how posting frequency impacts your odds of success on TikTok . If you\u2019ve ever wondered how often you really need to post to grow on TikTok , this is for you. Spoiler: The \u201cpost 3 times a day\u201d crowd isn\u2019t totally wrong\u2026 but the data tells a much more nuanced story. Jump to a section: How often should you post on TikTok? How posting frequency affects views on TikTok \u2014 the study The highest lift is moving to 2 to 5 posts per week More posts mean more chances to go viral Post smarter, not just more More TikTok resources \ud83d\udca1 If you\u2019re keen to dig into the data or you want some receipts for the recommendations we\u2019re making below, scroll down to the section The study: How posting frequency affects views on TikTok. How often should you post on TikTok? The short answer: Aim for 2 to 5 posts per week. Our data shows that going from posting just once to 2 to 5 times per week on TikTok can offer the most meaningful lift in views. However, posting more does mean more views \u2014 though not quite as many more as that first jump. Julian\u2019s analyses consistently showed that posting more often means more views per post. He found that TikTokers who go from posting once a week to: 2 to 5 times \u2192 get up to 17% more views per post 6 to 10 times \u2192 get up to 29% more views per post 11+ posts \u2192 get up to 34% more views per post Yes, 11+ posts a week is a lot \u2014 and technically gives you the most significant average lift. But here\u2019s the best bit (if you\u2019re a creator with a day job like me): The biggest jump happens when you go from 1 \u2192 2 to 5 posts per week. In other words, you\u2019ll get the most reward for your efforts if you up your cadence from 1 to between 2 and 5 posts every week. Of course, because TikTok is complicated, this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll automatically start seeing an uptick in views, even if you jump to that 11+ posts per week cadence. This is because the increase in views doesn\u2019t come from a steady rise in performance per post but rather from the increased chances of breakout success. In fact, the median views per post stay pretty flat no matter how much you post. (More on this below). The reason: Our analysis showed that the more you post, the greater your chances of going viral with a single post. Let\u2019s unpack that. \u2728 Take the guesswork out of posting: Buffer makes it easy to plan, schedule, and analyze your TikTok posts \u2014 so you can stay consistent and get back to creating. \ud83d\udc49 Try Buffer for free \u2192 How posting frequency affects views on TikTok \u2014 the study Posting more means more views per post. (I\u2019m about to share some pretty impressive numbers, but there\u2019s a lot of nuance here, so do read the next couple of sections and not just this one!) Compared to just posting once per week, TikTokers who post: 2 to 5 times \u2192 17% more views per post 6 to 10 times \u2192 29% more views per post 11+ posts \u2192 34% more views per post Julian uncovered this with a fixed-effects regression model , which compares each account to itself over time. (Meaning it isolates the effect of frequency by removing account-level differences like follower count, niche, or brand strength.) The highest lift is moving to 2 to 5 posts per week Here\u2019s some of that nuance: the returns are diminishing. In other words, you\u2019ll get the best bang for your buck when you go from 1 post per week to 2 to 5. So yes, posting 11+ times a week brings the biggest lift. But the most efficient gain per extra post is in the 2 to 5 per week range. If you\u2019ve read our studies on how often to post on Instagram and LinkedIn , you\u2019ll know this is true of those platforms, too. Pretty convincing, right? Simply looking at the data above, we could reasonably conclude that TikTok seems to \u2018reward\u2019 users for posting more. Well, that\u2019s not exactly the case (buckle up, my friend). More posts mean more chances to go viral In some of Julian\u2019s initial analyses, average views per post remained relatively steady, no matter how frequently users post. Similarly, the median views per post actually fall a bit at higher cadences. So, er \u2014 what the heck is going on? \u201cThis implies that the distribution of views per post becomes more skewed at higher posting frequency, even if the typical post doesn\u2019t necessarily perform better,\u201d Julian explains. In other words: TikTok views are heavily skewed. Most posts get modest numbers, and a few go viral. So, looking at the mean or median views alone can miss what\u2019s happening at the top end. To better understand this, Julian sorted the view counts from lowest to highest and turned his magnifying glass on the top 10% of posts (aka the 90th percentile or p90) This helps answer: \u201cHow much better are the best posts doing when people post more often?\u201d Weekly Posts Median Views 90th Percentile Views Viral Potential (p90/median ratio) 1 Post 489 3,722 7.6x 2\u20135 Posts 506 6,983 13.8x 6\u201310 Posts 487 10,092 20.7x 11+ Posts 459 14,401 31.4x Even though the median views per post stay around ~500, the top 10% of posts perform significantly better at higher cadences. Hold up: what about smaller accounts? Those p90 views per post numbers are impressive \u2014 and something you might not be used to seeing if you have a new or smaller account (\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). Does that mean increasing your posting frequency will only help when you have a larger account? Not at all! Julian\u2019s regression models controlled for that \u2014 and found that the relative gains hold true across all account sizes. And remember, that 90% percentile was per post, not account. TikTok content performance is not as follower-dependent as a platform like Instagram. Even new creators can have viral posts. Whether you have 500 followers or 50,000, increasing your posting cadence can help increase your chances of virality. I really like this analogy: Posting more frequently doesn\u2019t necessarily raise the floor, but it does raise the ceiling . Post smarter, not just more As always, remember that quantity is impactful, but quality will always be the most important factor in social media success. So instead of stressing about daily uploads, focus on showing up consistently and making content you\u2019re proud of . As our data shows, even increasing your output from one post to three posts per week can move the needle. Julian summed it up best: \u201cPosting more helps \u2014 but mostly because it increases your chances of getting lucky. TikTok is heavy-tailed. You only need one post to pop off. Posting more just increases your odds.\u201d More TikTok resources The Best Time to Post on TikTok in 2025 \u2014 New Data TikTok Algorithm Guide 2025: Everything We Know About How Videos Are Ranked TikTok Bulletin Boards: What They Are, How They Work, and Why They Matter 14 Ways to Get More Followers on TikTok in 2025 \u2014 Tried and Tested 13 Trending Songs on TikTok in 2025 (+ How to Use Them) Top 250 TikTok Hashtags for 2025 + How to Use Them for Growth Kirsti Lang Senior Content Writer @ Buffer Kirsti is a journalist-turned-marketer and creator who\u2019s built an audience on TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

Artificial intelligence is not going to do your best work for you, of course. We know there\u2019s (thankfully?) still work to be done in replicating the weirdness and wonder of human creativity. But AI can take some of the work off your plate, so you can focus on exactly that: creating. However, with the ever-growing list of AI software and tools on the market \u2014 all promising to help you generate, streamline, and automate your writing process \u2014 it can be tricky to figure out which ones are worth your time (and money).

From Google Docs to Notion to every app with a \u2018magic\u2019 button, AI writing is no longer a shiny feature \u2014 it\u2019s table stakes. But here\u2019s the thing: while many tools use the same underlying models (like OpenAI\u2019s GPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude), they\u2019re not all built the same. The difference is in the workflows, the interface, and whether the tool actually helps you do your job better \u2014 or just adds another tab to your browser.

There are a plethora of ways to use AI tools in your content creation process, but here are some ways I\u2019m using AI as a writer: Generate ideas Draft article outlines Rephrase paragraphs or phrases with a specific tone Generate sentences or paragraphs when I\u2019m hit with writer\u2019s block (though I\u2019ll always fact-check, edit, or rewrite these) Repurpose blog posts into social media posts Write silly poems I can share for friends\u2019 birthdays OK, that last one doesn\u2019t exactly count as work, but it\u2019s one of my favorite ways to use it. For all of the above (and a few more tasks), these are the best AI writing tools I\u2019ve tested*. How I chose these tools There are a lot of AI writing tools out there \u2014 and plenty of them sound great on paper. But I was looking for ones that actually made writing easier, not more complicated. Here\u2019s what I prioritized when testing each one: Usefulness for content creators \u2014 I focused on tools that support tasks like outlining, repurposing, writing for social, or breaking through writer\u2019s block. Ease of use \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to spend hours learning a new tool. These are all beginner-friendly, with minimal setup required. Smart defaults \u2014 Whether it\u2019s tone, formatting, or SEO, the best tools offered strong outputs even when I gave minimal input. Room to grow \u2014 Bonus points if the tool had features I could grow into (like custom brand voice settings or workflow automation). None of these tools are perfect \u2014 but they all earned a spot by saving me time, reducing friction, and helping me get words on the page faster. The best AI writing tools 1. Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant Best AI writing tool for social media content \u26a1 Get AI help writing and refining your social media posts right in Buffer. Sign up for our forever-free plan here \u2192 Buffer's AI Assistant was built for social media. You can use it as and when you create and schedule your content with Buffer, making the content creation process seamless (no more copy-pasting to various social networks \u2014 especially tedious if you\u2019re cross-posting to multiple platforms). The best thing about Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant is that it understands the nuances of each social media platform. For example, the content you create for X (formerly Twitter) won\u2019t exceed your character limit. It\u2019s also trained to make the tone of LinkedIn content more professional, Instagram more playful, and so on. Another time-saving feature is the editing buttons within the assistant. Instead of having to type further instructions to the Assistant to tweak your post, just click Rephrase , Shorten , Expand , More casual , or More formal to get you closer to the content you\u2019re after. You can also use these buttons to tweak certain parts of your posts if you don\u2019t want to rewrite the whole lot \u2014 another time saver. (If you\u2019re new to using AI in this way, this beginner\u2019s guide to using AI for social media is a helpful read.) Beyond these fundamental features, here are some of my favorite use cases as a writer looking to create more content on social media and build my personal brand : Personalized ideas In my experience as a creator and social media manager, social media writer\u2019s block is SO much worse than the regular kind. Perhaps it\u2019s the sheer volume of content you have to create. Who knows. Mercifully, I\u2019ve found Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant, which means this is a thing of the past. When I\u2019m stuck on what to post, I head over to Buffer\u2019s Create Space (where I brain-dump all my post ideas) and click the Generate Ideas button. To get a better sense of what is going to resonate with your audience, the assistant will ask you two things: What is your business about? Who is your target audience? From there, the Assistant will generate a stream of ideas for you to assess, one at a time. On each one, you\u2019ll be able to hit Use it, which will open a pre-filled post creation window, or Try another to regenerate . Repurpose other posts and content One of the best use cases for this tool is the ability to repurpose content that has performed well or rewrite it to be more appropriate for another platform. I often use the latter to rework posts I\u2019ve created for LinkedIn into a Twitter thread (something that used to take me ages). Something else I\u2019m leaning into right now is repurposing older social media posts into something fresh. There\u2019s a fair chance a huge chunk of my audience missed certain posts, and those who saw them likely won\u2019t remember if they did (especially if the original post has been given a glow-up). I also use the AI Assistant to summarize entire blog posts I\u2019ve written into bite-sized social snippets \u2014 another thing that used to take me ages. Free and limitless on all Buffer plans Unlike many other AI writer tools, especially those built for social media, there\u2019s no \u2018credits\u2019 system in place. The AI Assistant is free to use, as is Buffer (for up to three channels). When it comes to the number of prompts and rephrases you can submit, the limit does not exist! \u26a1 Level up your social media presence with Buffer AI Assistant. Get started here \u2192 Bonus: No-sign-up-required Social Media Post Creator You don\u2019t need to be a Buffer user to use the AI Assistant. With the free Social Media Post Creator , you can take the tool for a test run (or use it indefinitely) without creating an account or sharing your email address. 2. Jasper Best AI writing tool for Marketing teams As one of the first AI writing tools to market (then known as Jarvis), Jasper has had time to hone its UI and feature set. Along with AI text generation for a plethora of specific projects \u2014 everything from landing pages to full-on marketing campaigns, Jasper also boasts Remix (a dedicated tool for reworking content via a link, uploaded document, or text), Chat (a back-and-forth chat box with the AI to help you brainstorm or hone ideas), plus a Chrome extension. Jasper has moved beyond just copywriting and now aims squarely at marketing teams. The collaborative features mean everyone can jump into various documents and view projects and campaigns at a glance with nifty Kanban and calendar views. Managers and editors can also add in things like brand voice and style guide documents to ensure things stay on track across all content pieces. When writing, Jasper\u2019s intuitive system will ask you to enter a simple prompt or choose from a list of templates. From there, you\u2019ll be asked for more information upfront, which differs depending on what you\u2019re working on. Before generating your draft, you can add things like your target audience, specific points to include, and more \u2014 but the AI can predict these things so well that this usually just involves choosing from some recommended options. While Jasper is intuitive and great for teams, it\u2019s worth noting that the foundation of the tool is the same as most of the other (cheaper) options on this list. Jasper \u201cuses over a dozen language models,\u201d but the marketing copy generated is similar to what you\u2019ll get from ChatGPT and other AI writing software. Pricing: 7-day trial, then prices start at $49 per month 3. Copy.ai Best AI writing tool for automating repetitive writing tasks Copy.ai is another tool on this list that has outgrown the content generation mold it was born into. The multifaceted tool aims to help Sales and Marketing teams go from \u201cgo-to-market bloat to velocity.\u201d What that means in practice is a slick tool a lot like Jasper. However, Copy.ai places more ",

      "content_text": "A social media strategy might feel a little like a box-ticking exercise. Do you really need one to be successful on social media (especially if you\u2019re a creator, rather than an enterprise social media marketer?). If getting views for views\u2019 sake is all you\u2019re after, maybe not \u2014\u00a0loads of folks go viral by accident. But where to from there? Even if you do manage to successfully build an audience, how will you monetize? Turn them into subscribers? Convert them into customers? That\u2019s where your social media strategy comes in. Your social media strategy defines where you want your social media presence to be in six months, one year, or five \u2014 and it's the map you\u2019ll use to guide you there. Here\u2019s a lightweight guide to creating your own from scratch. Wait, what is a social media marketing strategy, exactly? Good question! Let's talk about what it is \u2014 and isn't. Social media marketing is using social media platforms \u2014 like Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, etc. \u2014 to promote your business and build a community . It also includes paid social media marketing, like running ads and influencer marketing . So, like a social media calendar then? Well, not quite. What\u2019s the difference between a social media calendar and a social media marketing strategy? A social media marketing strategy is the driving force behind why you post what you post and choose the social media platforms you\u2019ve selected. It outlines your social media goals and the metrics you use to measure your success. Think of it as a roadmap, a guide to help you get where you want to go. A content calendar is the place where you slot your social media posts. It shows what content will go live, when, and on which social media platform. Your strategy is your big-picture roadmap, then your content calendar is every mile you\u2019ll travel along the way. Why do you need a social media marketing strategy? To give direction to your social media marketing efforts and get clarity on what success looks like. The \u2018throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t work if you want to achieve a positive return on investment (ROI) . \ud83d\udcdd Note : This guide primarily focuses on building an organic social media marketing strategy. If you want to understand how to add a paid social strategy into the mix, read our guide on creating the ideal hybrid strategy . How to create a social media marketing strategy in 7 steps 1. Conduct a social media audit 2. Know your target audience deeply 3. Set SMART social media goals 4. Choose and understand the social media platforms you\u2019re going to be on 5. Identify content gaps and set your content pillars 6. Set up your social media content calendar 7. Analyze your social media insights regularly and tweak your strategy If you\u2019ve already been dabbling in social media marketing for a while, begin with the first step in the following section. If you\u2019re starting from scratch, jump straight to step two. 1. Conduct a social media audit If you were already posting on your social media handles (however infrequently), evaluate: What kind of posts get the most engagement for your social media accounts? Which types of social media content led to the most profile visits? What types of social media posts did you enjoy creating the most? Look at your social media analytics and also reflect intrinsically on what you think worked the best for you. These insights are important to determine how you want to move forward. Maybe you decide to switch channels because you didn\u2019t enjoy creating content for a social media platform. Or perhaps you found educational posts got the most direct messages (DMs) and engagement for your target audience. Once you\u2019ve done that, take those findings with you to the following six steps. And remember, the below steps don\u2019t have to follow a chronological order \u2014 they will inform and impact each other. 2. Know your target audience deeply Some resources will start with setting social media goals, which is a great first step, but Instagram creator and consultant, Elise Darma , recommends putting audience research front and center. \u201cCustomer research isn't just part of my strategy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's the foundation of everything I do.\u201d You need to understand your target audience deeply to create social media content that genuinely helps them. What should you know about your target audience? Basic audience demographics : Their age, gender, location, job title, salary, etc. Jobs to be done : What are they looking to accomplish with your product or service Challenges : What are their pain points and struggles (that your product or service can alleviate) Social media platforms\u2019 preference : Where do they hang out online Types of content they love : Entertaining, educational, funny, relatable, etc. and video vs. image posts Influencers in the industry they trust : People they follow on social media who are thought leaders in your niche For Jade Beason , creator and social media consultant, understanding your target audience\u2019s pain points is the most crucial finding: \u201cGet really, really clear on what your audience\u2019s pain points are,\u201d Jade says. \u201cThis will help you create content that solves those pain points \u2014 whether it\u2019s via educational, entertaining, or relatable content.\u201d Now, the next question arises: How do you gather these insights about your target audience? Jade says the best way to practice audience research is via social listening : \u201cListen to what your audience is saying about your content. But also monitor what your audience is saying under other people\u2019s content (which is similar to yours).\u201d Elise says she gathers customer insights from four places: Analyzing DM interactions Direct conversations with her audience Student feedback during and after programs Studying which content gets the most meaningful engagement I won\u2019t sugarcoat it: Audience research is a beast . You need to understand what your audience likes, cares about, enjoys, and so much more. It\u2019s a lot of work, but it\u2019s worth the investment. When you know your audience\u2019s pain points, you can create truly helpful content on your social media profiles. Here\u2019s how I would advise you to begin audience research: If you\u2019ve already been posting on social media, analyze your DMs, posts, and comments If you\u2019re putting together a strategy for business, ask your adjacent marketing, growth, sales, and customer support teams for insights about your ideal customers Spend time in online spaces where your target audience or customers hang out \u2014\u00a0other social channels, forums, private communities, Discord servers, etc. Subscribe to industry newsletters and follow thought leaders in your niche to stay up to date about current events and trends As a business, you could, incentivize customers (with gift cards, coupon codes, etc.) to chat with you directly via 1:1 calls or surveys If you can, invest in an audience research software (like SparkToro ) or social listening tools Remember : Audience research is never done . You need to continually stay in touch with how your audience's needs evolve. It might be a boulder to tackle initially, but once you start getting some followers on social media, it becomes easier to gather feedback. 3. Set SMART social media goals Knowing why you are on social media is one of the most essential ingredients of a successful social media strategy. It\u2019ll help you understand what social media success looks like and give direction to your efforts. How do you set social media goals ? If you\u2019re a social media manager for a business, find out your business goals for the quarter or year. Are you focusing on customer acquisition? Or do you want to retain existing customers? Perhaps you want to save costs and improve efficiency. Whatever it is, your social media efforts must work in the same direction as your broader business objectives. Why? Because as social media marketers, impacting the bottom line is crucial to prove the impact of your social media strategy and show a positive ROI. Achieving business objectives using social media marketing will also help you get buy-in for hiring more social media managers, investing in new social media channels, getting the budget for social media advertising , etc. How do you set social media goals as a creator? Brainstorm how social media is helping you achieve your goals. Do you want more influencer partnerships to earn money from your content? Or perhaps you want to increase your newsletter subscribers using social media. Keep this goal in mind as you create social media content. Jade explains how your success metrics will differ based on your overall goals with an example: \u201cYour success metrics will depend on what your objectives are,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re on Instagram to grow, then your view-through rate and retention might be the most important. But if you\u2019re on Instagram to build a community, then your interactions are the most important metric.\u201d To give a creator example, Elise tracks the following metrics: How her content translates into sales (she generated $60-80K monthly, even during maternity leave) How effectively she\u2019s connecting with new audiences (her best content reaches up to 86% of non-followers) How well she\u2019s serving her existing customers (she has helped over 56,487 students so far) She advises creators to be flexible in their goals and pivot according to their audience\u2019s needs: \u201cThe key is staying flexible enough to pivot when you spot an opportunity,\u201d Elise says. \u201cIt's not about sticking to rigid plans \u2014 it's about watching what resonates with your audience and being ready to serve them in the way they need most.\u201d Setting social media marketing goals will also simplify what kind of social media content you should create. For example, if your goal as a business is to boost brand awareness, you\u2019ll post more engagement-centric content. But if you want to generate leads for your digital products as a creator, you\u2019ll create more selling-related content. How many goals should you have? If you\u2019re a creator, it",

      "content_text": "As a marketer, you might have heard that Gen Z prefers TikTok, Instagram is trendier and so on. But Facebook is far from flailing. It\u2019s the biggest social network in the world \u2014 by a large margin. Gen Z prefers TikTok, Instagram is trendier, and new platforms are emerging to capture attention. But the data says different: Facebook isn\u2019t merely hanging on, it\u2019s the biggest social network in the world. With over 3 billion monthly active users, Facebook sits at the center of Meta\u2019s ecosystem and is one of the most important channels for marketers thanks to its highly effective ads . Its user base spans nearly every demographic and region, making it a platform that businesses can\u2019t ignore, even as newer apps dominate headlines. This roundup covers who uses Facebook in 2025, what performs, and how it shows up in consumer behavior and creator campaigns. Facebook\u2019s user base is massive (and more diverse than you might think) Despite endless debates about whether Facebook is \u201cfor older generations\u201d or \u201closing relevance,\u201d the numbers don\u2019t lie: Facebook is the biggest social platform in the world. Facebook still dominates with over 3 billion monthly users According to Statista, as of Q2 2024 , it had 3.07 billion monthly active users \u2014 nearly 40% of the global population. Scale matters here \u2014 no platform can match Facebook's reach and demographics. And if you zoom out to Meta\u2019s family of apps (the parent company of Facebook), the numbers get even larger. An estimated 90% of social media users worldwide have a Facebook account , and across Meta\u2019s family of apps \u2014 including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp \u2014 3.48 billion people log in daily , according to Statista, 2025 . So if you\u2019re wondering whether your audience is on Facebook, the answer is likely: yes. Facebook\u2019s global audience skews slightly male According to Statista, 2025 , 56.8% of Facebook\u2019s audience identifies as male , while 43.2% identifies as female. If you\u2019re tailoring content to a specific audience, this skew is worth keeping in mind \u2014 especially compared to more balanced platforms like Instagram. \ud83d\udca1 Note : The data we have access to only includes binary gender options (male and female). No additional gender identities were captured or reported. Millennials make up Facebook\u2019s core audience Facebook\u2019s largest demographic is men aged 25\u201334 , who account for 18.5% of users, as shared by Statista, 2025 . In fact, millennials between 25 and 44 make up just over half of the platform\u2019s audience \u2014 a reminder that the group who first fueled Facebook\u2019s rise are still highly active. But younger audiences aren\u2019t absent. Men aged 18\u201324 are the second-largest user group, showing that Facebook continues to play a role in Gen Z\u2019s digital mix (even if they spend more time overall on TikTok or Instagram, as shared by DataReportal, 2023 ). At the other end of the age spectrum, only 6.1% of users are over 65 , despite Facebook\u2019s reputation as the \u201cboomer app.\u201d The average social media user spends 36 minutes per day on Facebook For the average social media user, Facebook is still part of their routine \u2014 nearly 19 hours a month, according to DataReportal, 2023 . That puts it behind apps like TikTok (33 hours, 38 minutes) and YouTube (27 hours, 26 minutes), but it\u2019s far from being \u201cchecked once in a while.\u201d Image Source This doesn\u2019t mean that you need to add Facebook to your strategy. But if you\u2019re marketing to millennials, Gen X, or even older groups, Facebook still commands meaningful daily attention. India leads the world in Facebook users Facebook may be global, but its audience isn\u2019t spread evenly. India tops the list with 383 million users (more than the entire U.S. population), according to Statista, 2025 . To put it in perspective, if India\u2019s Facebook audience were a country, it would be the third largest in the world. Other major markets include the United States (196.9 million) , Indonesia (122.3 million) , and Brazil (111.65 million) . Together, these four countries make up a massive share of Facebook\u2019s active audience and highlight where the platform has the most reach. This means Facebook isn\u2019t just a Western platform \u2014 its influence is strongest in large, mobile-first markets. If you\u2019re looking to grow internationally, these countries are where your campaigns could see the biggest impact. How people use Facebook Knowing who\u2019s on Facebook is only half the picture \u2014 the real insight comes from how people actually use it. While the platform may not influence cultural conversation at the same scale as TikTok or X, Facebook is still deeply woven into daily routines. For the creators, business owners, and marketers who rely on the platform, that mix of habitual use and massive reach means Facebook isn\u2019t fading into the background. It\u2019s just being used differently than it once was. Facebook is still one of the most visited sites in the world Despite how long it's been around \u2014 or maybe because of that \u2014 Facebook remains a daily habit for billions. According to Similarweb , it\u2019s the third most-visited website globally , behind only Google and YouTube. That puts it ahead of newer heavyweights like TikTok and Instagram. This ranking shows that even if people spend less time per session than on other platforms, they keep coming back \u2014 often multiple times a day. Most people use Facebook only on their phones Like every major social platform, Facebook has gone mobile-first. Today, 81.8% of users access Facebook exclusively through their phones , while just 1.5% use desktop only, according to Statista, 2024 . The rest split their time between the two. That dominance of mobile matters for both creators and brands. Content needs to be designed for vertical scrolling, grabbing attention in the first few seconds, and encouraging interactions. Stories draw half a billion daily users Even as Meta shifts its content focus toward reels, across its platforms, Facebook Stories haven\u2019t faded. According to the platform, more than 500 million people use stories every day, making it one of the platform\u2019s most consistent features. Image Source Stories thrive because they\u2019re quick, casual, and mobile-native. They don\u2019t require polished production or long watch times \u2014 they\u2019re designed to disappear, which makes them feel more authentic. That\u2019s also why advertisers love them: stories provide a way to meet audiences in the flow of their daily scrolling without demanding too much attention. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more here: A Complete Guide to Posting on Facebook Stories Content performance and engagement Not all Facebook posts perform the same. It\u2019s vital to know which content types perform best and capture attention on the platform. Facebook posts have one of the highest average engagement rates across social platforms According to Buffer\u2019s 2025 engagement rate study , Facebook posts average a 5.07% engagement rate \u2014 the second-highest across major social platforms, behind only LinkedIn (6.50%). That puts Facebook ahead of TikTok (4.86%), YouTube (4.41%), and Instagram (1.16%). Notably, engagement on Facebook has held steady. While its siblings, Instagram and Threads, saw major swings in interaction patterns, Facebook held strong at around 5.45%. Much of this comes down to how its core audience uses the platform and Meta\u2019s continued investment in new content and monetization features. Photos and albums outperform other post types Despite Meta\u2019s big push into video, photos are still the strongest performers on Facebook. In our 2025 analysis, pictures earned 35% more engagement than text posts and nearly 44% more than videos , making them the clear winners on the feed. Text posts came in second, edging out video by about 6.7%, while posts with links landed firmly in last place. This ranking makes sense: Facebook\u2019s feed has always rewarded quick, scroll-stopping visuals. A single photo or carousel is easier to consume than a video that requires sound or a link that pulls users out of the app. Even as Facebook Reels gain traction, images remain the format most likely to spark visible interactions. In other words, on Facebook, simple visuals still punch above their weight. Video is still a breakout format on Facebook Static visuals may top the charts for engagement, but video remains one of Facebook\u2019s fastest-growing formats. Forty percent of all time spent on Facebook and Instagram is dedicated to watching videos , according to eMarketer . And when it comes to short-form specifically, Facebook Reels now reach an estimated 616.8 million people \u2014 nearly a third of the platform\u2019s ad inventory, according to DataReportal, 2023 . Meta has been explicit about its focus here: Reels are reshared 3.5 billion times every day across Facebook and Instagram ( Meta Creators, 2025 ). That combination of reach and shareability has quickly made video the platform\u2019s most dynamic content type, even if photos still dominate the feed. The best time to post on Facebook is early morning If you\u2019re wondering when to post to get eyes on your content, early mornings can help you stand out. Buffer\u2019s 2025 analysis of more than 1 million posts shows that the single best time to post is 5 a.m. on Monday , with other strong slots on Tuesday at 5 a.m. and Thursday at 7 a.m. Why so early? It comes down to behavior. Facebook\u2019s largest demographic is adults aged 25\u201334 , followed closely by 35\u201344 \u2014 groups most likely to check their feeds before work or right as they wake up. Even if your post isn\u2019t seen immediately, early-morning publishing lets it percolate in the feed so it\u2019s waiting when users log on. Wednesday is the best day to post on Facebook When it comes to days of the week, mid-week wins. Posts shared on Wednesday see the highest overall engagement , edging out Thursday and Tuesday. On the flip side, weekends lag behind \u2014 posts on Sunday average 15% less engagement than those shared mid-week. While the difference between weekdays is small, the pattern is clear: Facebook thrives when people are in their workweek routines, not when they\u2019re",

      "content_text": "AI chatbots like ChatGPT have become ubiquitous and vital to how many knowledge workers, content creators, and business owners operate. But as powerful as ChatGPT is, it\u2019s not the only player in the game \u2014 and sometimes, exploring alternatives can reveal new ways to streamline your workflow. That\u2019s where this guide comes in. Instead of just rating chatbots based on generic criteria like accuracy, speed, and creativity, I wanted to see how they perform in a real-world content workflow. So, I paid for the subscriptions (courtesy of Buffer\u2019s AI Tools stipend that will help me recoup those costs) and fed them data from my own social media, and gave a structured challenge to each one designed to evaluate how well they take existing inputs and turn them into meaningful insights. Let\u2019s dive into the details and determine which chatbot delivers the best results. The experiment: How I tested the chatbots There\u2019s no shortage of AI chatbot comparisons online, but many focus on isolated prompts rather than real-world use cases \u2014 especially those relevant to you, our audience of creators, and small business owners. To truly test how useful these tools are for creators, I needed a challenge that mirrored how we actually use AI in a content workflow. So, instead of throwing random questions at each chatbot, I set up a structured experiment: I uploaded a CSV file with 60 days of my LinkedIn posts and their performance data\u2014real engagement metrics from my latest posts. I gave each chatbot a series of interconnected prompts to see how well it could analyze, generate, and refine content. I kept everything within one continuous conversation, testing their ability to retain and apply context. What I was testing for This test was designed to evaluate each chatbot across five key areas: Data analysis: Can it break down LinkedIn performance metrics and extract useful insights? Creativity & content generation: Can it generate fresh, non-generic (super important) content ideas based on real engagement data? Format adaptation: Can it transform a high-performing idea into multiple content formats (LinkedIn post, Twitter thread, short-form video script)? Strategic insights: Does it offer clear, actionable advice to improve content performance? Workflow optimization: Can it help streamline content planning, repurposing, and tracking? \ud83d\udea7 It\u2019s important that I clarify here: I'm no machine learning engineer, simply someone who has played around with enough chatbots, and has a decent context of different social media needs. So if you\u2019re looking for a very technical analysis, you won\u2019t find it here. The chatbots I selected five leading AI chatbots for this experiment, each with different strengths, pricing, and features: ChatGPT Claude Google Gemini (formerly Bard) Perplexity AI DeepSeek Now, let\u2019s get into the challenge and see how they performed. The challenge Each chatbot was given the same structured test \u2014 a continuous conversation where they had to analyze LinkedIn performance data, generate new content ideas, adapt content across formats, offer strategic insights, and create a workflow for ongoing content success. After uploading the CSV file containing my posts and data, I asked each bot these questions: Here\u2019s my LinkedIn performance data. What types of posts performed best and why? Based on what worked, suggest five new LinkedIn content ideas. Take the best-performing idea and turn it into a LinkedIn post, a Twitter thread, and a short-form video script. How can I improve my LinkedIn engagement rate based on this dataset? Create a content workflow that helps me repurpose high-performing content and track engagement. Here are the results. ChatGPT Best at retaining context Rating: 3.5/5 Pricing: Free with limited access; $20 per month for GPT-4 ChatGPT is OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbot and arguably the most well-known AI tool on this list. With its ability to generate structured responses, adapt content across formats, and provide strategic recommendations, it\u2019s a strong contender for creators looking to streamline their workflow. ChatGPT started strong analyzing the average performance of each post type, showing that analysis, and then giving a strong, nuanced list of takeaways and recommendations. It didn\u2019t state anything too unique (videos performed best, carousel posts had the most impressions), but the insights were good to have. However, the request for engagement rate improvement ideas showed off ChatGPT\u2019s data analysis capabilities even better. It broke down the engagement rate data by post type, day, and even hour. Then, more impressively, it gave a list of actionable tips, including the best time to post on LinkedIn according to my data \u2014 something none of the other tools did. Other suggestions it made were to prioritize video and text posts and improve my early engagement strategy by responding to the comments in the first 30 minutes of posting. ChatGPT also really shined in delivering hyper-relevant ideas. When asked for unique content ideas, the bot gave me a list that played off my existing high-performing topics and formats. For example, it recommended I share a behind-the-scenes of my LinkedIn video process, an idea I\u2019ll definitely be using. When asked to turn one of the ideas into different formats, it pulled from its memory of our previous chats, plus the context it had about my preferred voice and tone, to deliver well-structured and relevant results. The final request for a workflow initially seemed promising, with a clean, structured visual chart mapping out how to repurpose content. But while that was nice to look at, it wasn\u2019t until I asked for a more practical version \u2014 something i could turn into a Notion page or Google Doc, that it became actually useful. This is something I repeatedly struggle with when using ChatGPT to kickstart a visual reference for what my templates or dashboards might look like \u2014 getting anything immediately actionable can be difficult. And that\u2019s where the next tool on our list excels. I\u2019ll conclude with a caveat here: I\u2019ve had a ChatGPT account for a while now \u2014 at least a full year \u2014 so the bot had a lot of context to pull from as it can retain context from previous chats. So, that definitely influenced its performance and responses. However, I\u2019d call that a point in its favor as it means that it will give you better responses with frequent use. \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Final verdict: ChatGPT is a strong option for content creators who need structured insights, detailed engagement strategies, and adaptable content formats. However, its responses often require additional refinement to become truly actionable. Frequent use improves its recommendations, making it a solid choice for the long term. Claude AI Best for generating workflow mockups Rating: 3.5/5 Pricing: Free with limited use; $20 per month Developed by Anthropic, Claude AI is designed to be a conversational, long-form assistant with a focus on thoughtful and structured responses. Unlike some of the other chatbots in this experiment, Claude approaches tasks with a more methodical and organized style, making it a compelling option for those who prioritize clarity in their workflows. But how well does that translate to practical scenarios? Well, instead of going through the prompts chronologically, I want to focus on Claude\u2019s visualization capabilities and state, for the record, that they are the best of the bunch. From the first prompt, Claude translated the data into something super easy to look at, along with the recommendations that were par for the course for every chatbot tool. Having the data presented in a bar chart immediately gave me a clear understanding of my next steps. It continued this trend throughout the conversation without being prompted. My favorite thing about Claude, by far, is its ability to code and create a visual mockup of a workflow or database within the chat in a little preview window on the right. This has made it ten times easier to create Notion pages that do exactly what I need, with minimal time spent figuring out where to place which element. Claude had some interesting ideas on the content front, including a \u201ccreator tools revealed\u201d video and a suggestion to ask a community question each week. However, interesting did not always translate to relevant, as it didn\u2019t consider the actual content of the posts within the CSV file it had in its memory. Overall, the ideas shared weren\u2019t as relevant to me and my content as they could have been. However, I was pleased by the formatting of the ideas that it did gave me \u2014 when asked for a LinkedIn post and short-form video script based on the first idea it shared, it delivered something that could have been pasted as-is (if not for the totally made-up information). In terms of providing a simple analysis of the data, it returned some interesting results, including a suggestion to keep posts to 600 characters or less, which I\u2019ll be using going forward. \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Final verdict: Claude AI stands out as the best chatbot for visualization and structured formatting. If you need clear, data-driven charts and workflow previews, it\u2019s hard to beat. However, its content generation lacks precision and relevance, requiring extra input and validation to ensure accuracy. It also doesn\u2019t have search capabilities, which is important to consider before you subscribe. Perplexity AI Best for research and discovery Rating: 2.5/5 Pricing: Free with limited features; $20 per month Perplexity AI takes a unique approach compared to other chatbots, allowing users to select different models, including some already featured in this experiment. This flexibility makes it a strong research tool, particularly for content creators who need AI assistance in uncovering trends, following up on key insights, and gathering information. Although the consensus around Perplexity is that it\u2019s a great tool for research, not necessarily for strategy, and I\u2019d be inclined to agree after this experiment.

      "content_text": "Posting more often definitely helps you grow on LinkedIn. The research has shown it, and I've experienced it myself. But, how much more? I\u2019ve grown my account to nearly 20,000 followers with different experimental approaches to posting, from 30-day consistency challenges to skipping entire weeks. Meanwhile, my colleague Sabreen has crossed 17,000 by posting every single day for the past year. These varied approaches are common. Some creators swear by posting once a week. Others insist on posting daily \u2014 or even multiple times a day. With so much conflicting advice, it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s actually right. So we teamed up with Buffer\u2019s data scientist, Julian Winternheimer, to dig into over 2 million posts from 94,000+ LinkedIn accounts. Our goal: to figure out how posting frequency really impacts reach and engagement on LinkedIn \u2014 and whether you can post too much. If you\u2019ve only been guessing at your LinkedIn cadence till now, this is for you. Jump to a section: How often should you post on LinkedIn? The study: How posting frequency affects growth on LinkedIn 1. Can you post too much on LinkedIn? 2. What\u2019s the first step that really moves the needle? 3. Does posting more always mean better results? 4. Do these results depend on your account size? The best content format on LinkedIn to grow consistently Turning data into your posting strategy How often should you post on LinkedIn? \ud83d\ude80 According to our findings, moving from 1 post a week to 2 to 5 is like flipping a switch \u2014 LinkedIn starts distributing your content more widely and rewarding you with stronger per-post performance. L: \ud83d\udc49 More posts spark more conversations. Accounts posting 11+ times weekly see nearly triple the engagements per post compared to once-a-week posters. R: \ud83d\udc49 The more often you post, the further each post travels. Reach per post climbs steadily, with the sharpest jump once you cross into 6\u201310 and 11+ posts per week. Our data shows that posting 2 to 5 times weekly on LinkedIn is the sweet spot for improving reach and engagement without overwhelming your schedule. This cadence can mean +1,182 more impressions per post and a 0.23 percentage point lift in engagement rate compared to posting just once a week. Julian also adds that, if you can sustain it, posting more is almost always better, not only in terms of total engagement, but engagement per post as well. \ud83d\udcc8 Posting 6 to 10 times weekly pushes the gains further with +5,001 more impressions per post and a 0.76 percentage point increase in engagement rate . \u26a1 At 11+ posts per week, the lift is dramatic with nearly 17,000 more impressions per post, 3x more engagements , and a 1.4 percentage point jump in engagement rate compared to posting just once. One post a week isn\u2019t enough. It keeps you active, but leaves growth on the table. What\u2019s more, these results are consistent no matter your audience size. Whether you\u2019ve got 500 followers or 50,000, posting more often makes every single post work harder. Our recommendations in a nutshell: \ud83e\udeb4 Grow your audience in a sustainable way : 2 to 5 posts per week \ud83d\ude80 Accelerate reach and engagement : 6 to 10 posts per week \ud83d\udcc8 Maximize growth (if you can maintain quality) : 11+ posts per week The study: How posting frequency affects growth on LinkedIn Buffer\u2019s data scientist, Julian Winternheimer, analyzed more than 2 million LinkedIn posts from 94,000+ accounts to understand how posting frequency really impacts performance. In this analysis, instead of looking only at totals (which can be misleading), he focused on three per-post metrics: Impressions per post \u2014 how many people saw each post on average Engagements per post \u2014 likes, comments, and shares per post Engagement rate per post \u2014 the percentage of viewers who interacted This addresses a common pain point at its root \u2014 when the same account posts more often, do their posts actually perform better? To make sure the results weren\u2019t skewed by account size or niche, he used two different approaches: Z-score analysis: Compared each account\u2019s high- and low-frequency weeks against its own average. Fixed effects regression: Controlled for account-level differences to isolate the effect of posting frequency. This analysis covers all four major post formats (text, image, video, and carousels or document PDFs) without breaking them out individually. \ud83d\udca1 If you\u2019re interested in seeing Julian\u2019s analysis, check out his blog for a deep dive . Let\u2019s get into the data. 1. Can you post too much on LinkedIn? The short answer: no. Our analysis shows that posting more often helps your performance on LinkedIn. Each step up in frequency delivers better per-post results, even after controlling for account size and niche. Here\u2019s what we found when comparing higher-frequency weeks to quieter ones for the same accounts : 2 to 5 posts per week: modest lift in reach (+1,182 impressions per post) and engagement rate (+0.23 percentage points). 6 to 10 posts per week: stronger lift (+5,001 impressions per post, +0.76 percentage points). 11+ posts per week: the biggest gains (+16,946 impressions per post, +1.40 percentage points, 3x more engagements). In other words, LinkedIn doesn\u2019t \u201ccap\u201d your reach or punish you for posting often. Instead, it compounds your visibility, surfacing more of your content to more people. The myth of \u201cposting too much\u201d probably comes from other platforms, where algorithms can suppress frequency. On LinkedIn, the opposite is true \u2014 more posts mean more opportunities for distribution. 2. What\u2019s the first step that really moves the needle? Moving from posting once a week to 2 to 5 times is where performance really begins. That shift alone means: +1,182 more impressions per post +0.23 percentage points in engagement rate It\u2019s the point where LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm seems to recognize you as \u201cactive\u201d and starts rewarding your content with better distribution. From there, each step up continues to deliver significant gains, but the curve steepens. At 6 to 10 posts per week, you see a bigger acceleration. And then 11+ posts per week is where you\u2019ll get the biggest benefits. For me, the best news here is that you don\u2019t need to post daily to see meaningful improvement. Even small increases in your weekly cadence can unlock compounding gains. So if more is better, is there ever a point where it stops paying off? 3. Does posting more always mean better results? Posting more always helps, but the marginal payoff decreases as you climb higher. Going from 1 to 5 posts transforms your performance. Pushing from 6 to 11 posts is still worth it if you can manage the workload, but the gains are incremental rather than exponential. Take the graph below as the source for this perspective. At first glance, engagement rates look higher at 1 post per week \u2014 but that\u2019s misleading. Engagement only seems to dip because the frequency of posts is increasing, so the rate is spread across more content. Going from 2 to 5 to 6 to 10 posts still delivers meaningful gains, but the growth isn\u2019t as dramatic as that first jump. At 11+ posts per week, you see the strongest lift, but the improvement between 6 to 10 posts and 11+ posts is even smaller than the leap from 1 post a week to 2 to 5. \ud83d\udca1 If you do want to post more, Julian\u2019s recommendation is to focus on quality. \u201cPost as often as you can \u2014 as long as the quality stays high. Low-quality content posted frequently won\u2019t yield great results.\u201d This is why we see 2 to 5 posts per week emerge as the \u201csweet spot\u201d for most accounts \u2014 it balances meaningful growth with a sustainable content cadence. 4. Do these results depend on your account size? A common pushback to posting-frequency advice is: \u201cSure, that works for big accounts \u2014 but will it work for me?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question. Larger accounts naturally get more reach and engagements, and they also tend to post more often. At first glance, it can look like the frequency effect is just a byproduct of size. That\u2019s why in this study, we controlled for account-level differences. Using Z-scores (which compare each account to its own baseline) and fixed effects regression (which isolates performance changes within the same account), we stripped out the variable of size to see what really happens when an account posts more often. And the results found that the pattern holds across the board. Small accounts with a few hundred followers saw the same relative lift when moving from 1 post to 2 to 5 as large accounts with tens of thousands. Bigger accounts gained more in absolute numbers, but the per-post improvements \u2014 higher reach, more engagements, stronger engagement rates \u2014 scaled consistently across the spectrum. In other words, this isn\u2019t just a big-brand advantage. Whether you have 500 followers or 50,000, increasing your posting frequency makes your posts perform better relative to your own average. Frequency is a lever every creator can pull. The algorithm rewards activity and consistency, not just account size. The best content format on LinkedIn to grow consistently If posting more often is one part of the equation, choosing the right format for you is another. Over the last few years, LinkedIn has transformed from a professional networking site into a true creator platform. Along the way, it\u2019s embraced video , carousels , and new feeds designed to keep people scrolling. \ud83d\udcdd Text posts : The simplest way to show up. Easy to publish, great for building the posting habit, but the lowest median engagement overall. \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Images : A strong step up, generating about 72% more engagement than text posts. \ud83c\udfa5 Videos : Still a major growth lever, earning 84% more engagement than text and slightly outperforming images. \ud83d\udcd1 Carousels (PDF document posts) : The clear winner for engagement and reach. They spark 278% more engagement than videos, 303% more than images, and nearly 600% more than text posts. Their swipeable nature makes them interactive, saveable, and great for sharing more depth. \ud83d\udd17 Posts with links : The one exception. They consistently see the lowest media",

      "content_text": "Recently, we realized our way of calculating MRR and ARR wasn\u2019t giving us the clearest picture of our business. A few months ago, we made the decision to cancel the Buffer subscriptions of 1,361 inactive annual legacy subscriptions. We let those customers know they can always use Buffer for free or sign up for an annual plan again. After sending that email and canceling the annual plans, we braced for a $14,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) drop. But the numbers didn\u2019t budge. We knew something was off when we didn\u2019t see the immediate impact of cancelling those subscriptions. Instead, those cancellations were being stretched across the next 12 months, tied to each customer\u2019s renewal date. That didn\u2019t sit right with us. Those customers\u2019 accounts had already been cancelled. Why should their revenue still be counted as if nothing had changed? Here\u2019s how we changed our calculations to get a clearer picture of Buffer\u2019s finances and a faster feedback loop on how customer experience drives growth. The change: recognizing churn immediately Until now, when customers cancelled their Buffer subscription, we continued counting their revenue until the end of their paid period. For example, someone cancelling halfway through an annual plan would remain \u2018active\u2019 until the twelve months ended. This method is common in analytics tools, like Chartmogul, because API limitations make it hard to track cancellations immediately. We\u2019ve put in the extra work to overcome that limitation, so our MRR and ARR now reflect cancellations in real time, making our numbers more accurate and responsive. Going forward, we\u2019re recognizing churn the moment it happens, at the exact point a customer churns. By definition, MRR is meant to reflect the future expectation of monthly recurring revenue. If a customer cancels today, they\u2019re gone. The revenue isn\u2019t \u201crecurring\u201d anymore. This shift has an immediate impact: our reported MRR/ARR is lower. To put this into perspective, we reported that our closing numbers for July were $1.93M MRR ($23.1M ARR). Those numbers have now been adjusted to $1.84M MRR and $22M ARR. Today in September, our MRR sits around $1.87M ($22.4M ARR) . That\u2019s below some of our recent milestones, like celebrating $23M in ARR and crossing 70,000 paid subscribers. But it\u2019s also a more accurate, real-time reflection of Buffer\u2019s revenue and customer count. Recognizing churn immediately gives us a clearer picture of the business and a faster feedback loop on how customer experience drives growth. When customers leave, we see it right away. And when they stay, that loyalty shows up more clearly, too. We\u2019re still syncing the data, but going forward, you\u2019ll see a dip on August 3rd in our transparent metrics when we cancelled those 1,361 inactive annual Buffer subscriptions. Choosing smaller, more accurate numbers \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we believe having this responsiveness baked into our metrics will serve us in providing a superior experience.\u201d - Joel Gascoigne , Founder CEO of Buffer The decision to recognize churn immediately wasn\u2019t a correction or a fix to a mistake. It was a deliberate choice to move away from the default in favor of what we believe is a higher-quality, more transparent methodology. It\u2019s also a bold choice. Many companies prefer delay recognizing churn until the end of a customer\u2019s paid period. This makes the reported numbers look larger for longer. We\u2019ve chosen the opposite: to reflect cancellations right when they happen. The result is smaller numbers, but ones that feel more accurate, transparent, and true to our customers\u2019 experience. And because we\u2019re independent, we have the freedom to report in the way we believe is most meaningful. For us, this is about being genuinely customer-centric and shaping every aspect of how we operate so that it reflects the real experiences of our customers. What this means going forward Our MRR and ARR charts will now move more responsively with customer behavior, both growth and churn. Some of our past milestones will look different (we\u2019ll be updating the historical data on our Open page to reflect this methodology). Fluctuations may appear sharper, especially around month-ends or when multiple cancellations happen on the same day. We see this as a feature, not a bug: it gives us even more incentive to reduce friction and improve the product experience. Staying true to transparency We know this might feel unusual. It\u2019s not common for SaaS companies to voluntarily adopt a methodology that lowers their headline numbers. But as soon as we realized this would improve how we use the numbers, we wanted to share it with you. We believe it strengthens the accuracy and transparency of our reporting, bringing us closer to our customers, which is ultimately our most important goal. At Buffer, transparency has always been one of our guiding principles. That means sharing not only the highs of our journey, but also the changes we make along the way as we learn and grow, on our way to building the healthiest and most customer-centric company possible. In the long run, we believe this change will make us a stronger, more resilient company. It gives us clearer insight into the impact of our product and customer experience work, and it ensures that when we celebrate future milestones, they\u2019ll be rooted in the most accurate reflection of our business.

      "content_text": "While it's always a good time to watch TikToks \u2014 globally, TikTok users spend an average of 34 hours on the platform per month \u2014 figuring out the best time to post on TikTok is a bit more complicated. And yet, knowing when to post on TikTok can be super helpful for content creators and small business owners alike. After all, creating TikToks is tough work ( trust me, I know ), so it makes sense to figure out your best time to post on TikTok. This is why we tapped into Buffer's data \u2014 analyzing more than 1 million videos, carousels, photos, and text posts \u2014 to pinpoint the best times to post on TikTok. In this guide, we\u2019ll help you find the best time to post on TikTok based on your audience, your goals, and the latest data (and, with any luck, land your videos on For You Pages worldwide). Jump to a section: Is there a best time to post on TikTok?

According to our data, yes \u2014 some posting times do seem to work better than others when it comes to the best time to post on TikTok. The analysis, conducted by Buffer's data scientist-in-residence, weighed up the median views of 1 million posts published through Buffer. These numbers helped us pinpoint some pretty clear patterns in the times of TikTok posts that tend to perform well compared to those that don't, which are, arguably, the best time to post on TikTok in 2025. But before we dig into our data, though, two important caveats: First , there is no universal best time to post on TikTok that will work for every video on the app. If only it were that easy! The best time to post on TikTok for you depends on your target audience \u2014 your audience location, timezones, and their behaviors \u2014 which is why I'll walk you through analyzing your own TikTok data to figure out the best time to post on TikTok for your target audience later in this article. Second, we may well see a shift in reach and engagement on the platform if the proposed TikTok Ban in the U.S. comes into play. We're keeping a close eye on all the legal developments and updating this article as new information emerges: TikTok in the U.S.: What We Know & What It Means For Your Buffer Account . Bookmark it, if you want to keep an eye on things! That said, the days and times in the charts below offer a handy guide to help you maximize your content potential while growing your following. If you\u2019re just getting started, using our data on the best time to post on TikTok is a great place to begin. Ready to get into the numbers? Let's take a look at the best time to post on TikTok in 2025. The best times to post on TikTok According to our data, the best time to post on TikTok is Sunday at 8 p.m. , followed by Tuesday at 4 p.m ., and Wednesday at 5 p.m. Videos, carousels, and text TikTok posts shared during those times tended to get the highest views of the week, though other slots weren't far behind. \ud83c\udf1e\u00a0Generally speaking, views tend to pick up later in the day, with peak time slots at 1 p.m. or later. This heatmap shows patterns in the best time to post on TikTok by hour and day. The darkest blocks are the time slots with the highest views (the best time to post) \u2014 and the light to white blocks are the time slots with the lowest views (times that are probably best avoided). TikTok is a particularly fascinating platform to look at in terms of posting times. In our other analyses of the best time to post on LinkedIn and even Instagram there are some really predictable patterns in video performance (and, we can assume, audience behavior). But with TikTok, things are less cut and dried. This is likely because TikTok has a younger demographic \u2014 35% of TikTok users in the US are 18 - 24 years old, the largest age group on the platform \u2014\u00a0with a less rigid schedule. \ud83c\udf0d Wait, what time zone? To make this data easier to understand, our data scientist Bufferoo has done some mathematical magic to make the recommended time zones universally applicable. In other words, no need to convert. Whether you're in EST (Eastern Standard Time), PST (Pacific Standard Time), or IST (Indian Standard Time), the times apply to you. The best time to post on TikTok at a glance Here's a quick look at the best time to post on TikTok every day of the week. The posting times appear in order of performance (so the first time mentioned is the best time for that day, and so on). The best time to post on TikTok on Monday: 7 p.m., 6 p.m., 5 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Tuesday: 4 p.m., 8 p.m., 2p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Wednesday: 5 p.m. 6 p.m., 4 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Thursday: 5 p.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Friday: 4 p.m. 2 p.m., 6 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Saturday: 5 p.m., 4 p.m., 7 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Sunday: 8 p.m., 5 p.m., 4 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Monday The best time to post on TikTok on Monday is 7 p.m., closely followed by 6 p.m., then 5 p.m., according to Buffer data. \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Monday: 7 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Tuesday The best time to post on TikTok on Tuesday is 4 p.m. Videos posted at 8 p.m. received the second-highest median views, followed by 2 p.m, so add those into your TikTok posting schedule, too. \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Tuesday: 4 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Wednesday On Wednesdays, the best time to post on TikTok is 5 p.m., closely followed by 6 p.m., then 4 p.m. Wednesday is the best day to post on TikTok, so it's definitely worth adding to your posting schedule. \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Wednesday: 5 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Thursday The best time to post on TikTok on Thursday is 5 p.m. Videos posted at 1 p.m. received the second-highest median views, closely followed by 3 p.m. \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Thursday: 5 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Friday On Friday, the best time to post on TikTok is at 4 p.m.. There is another solid posting time at 2 p.m., then in the early evening at 6 p.m. \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Friday: 4 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Saturday Saturday is a quieter time on TikTok, though there are some optimal times worth noting. The best time to post on TikTok is 5 p.m. followed by 4 p.m., then 7 p.m. \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Saturday: 5 p.m. The best time to post on TikTok on Sunday The best time to post on TikTok on Sunday is at 8 p.m., one of the best times to post throughout the entire week \u2014 so bookmark this slot for your TikTok posting schedule for maximum engagement. Other good times to post on TikTok on Sunday are 5 p.m. and 4 p.m. (I highly recommend opting to schedule posts on Sunday, if you don't fancy 'working' on the weekend!) \u23f0 When to post on TikTok on Sunday: 8 p.m. This is where social media scheduling tools like Buffer shine. Experiment by systematically going through the times on the list above, scheduling a TikTok, and tracking its performance to see what works best for your specific audience. \ud83d\udca1 Just as there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all best time to post, there\u2019s no single best time to post across all social media platforms. Here\u2019s the best time to post on Instagram , the best time to post on Facebook , and the best time to post on LinkedIn . The best day of the week to post on TikTok The best day of the week to post on TikTok is Wednesday . Overall, videos, carousels, and text TikTok posts shared on Wednesday tended to perform the best. Thursday and Friday are tied for second place in terms of the best day of the week to post on TikTok. The worst day of the week to post on TikTok is Saturday, when there's a notable dip in views of TikTok posts shared on that day. If you do need to post on TikTok on Saturday, there is a slight peak in TikTok engagement at 5 p.m. The best content type to post on TikTok As an added bonus in these analyses, we look at not only the best time to post, but also the best type of content to post on the platform. On TikTok, the answer probably won't surprise you at all \u2014 it's video. That said, pictures (or carousels) and text posts put in a pretty good showing on a platform that was once exclusively for video. Our data found that videos only see 18% more views than text posts and 7% more than photos or carousels. In turn, photos or carousels perform 11% better than text posts. How to find your best time to post on TikTok As always, when it comes to the best time to post data, I advise you to take these times with a pinch of salt! Every social media audience is different \u2014\u00a0particularly when it comes to the diversity of TikTok users \u2014 and will behave in different ways. These time slots are a great starting point to experiment with. I highly suggest you do if you're unsure of your best posting time! But, TikTok is one of the more helpful social media platforms, thanks to some handy audience insights. In fact, you can see exactly when your followers (not just TikTok users in general) have been online in the past week, to help you make more informed decisions about when to post your next videos. Here's how: 1. See when your TikTok followers are active To find it, head over to your TikTok account. Then: Tap on your profile picture to go to your TikTok profile,\u00a0then TikTok Studio just underneath your bio on your TikTok account (you can also download the TikTok Studio app for a more streamlined experience). Here, you'll find an overview of TikTok's tools for brands and creators. From there, tap the \u2018 View all ' link just to the right",

      "content_text": "If you're on the hunt for a social media management tool, chances are that Buffer and Hootsuite are some of the first names that pop up \u2014 with good reason. These two options are among the best, and both come packed with features to make social media management easy and help you grow your following. So, which one is best? It's an interesting question without a straightforward answer. Perhaps a better question would be: Which social media management tool is right for you? While both Buffer and Hootsuite offer similar core features \u2014 social media management, scheduling, and analytics \u2014 they were built with pretty different users in mind. Generally speaking, Buffer serves small to medium businesses, solopreneurs, and creators. Hootsuite, on the other hand, is primarily focused on large social media marketing teams at bigger businesses. You'll see these target users reflected in different ways across the tools, from how features work to the pricing structure (we'll break down the specifics below). That's not to say that, if you're on a large marketing team, Hootsuite is automatically the best option for you. The most important things to consider when weighing Buffer vs. Hootsuite are the following: Buffer vs Hootsuite feature overview Plans and pricing Ease of use Social media planning and scheduling Social media analytics Social media engagement Team collaboration features Let's take a closer look at the two tools. Buffer vs Hootsuite feature overview Here's a bird's-eye view of the key features and the cost of both tools. I'll go over most of these in greater depth in the rest of the article. Buffer Hootsuite Free plan \u2705 Three social channels/social media accounts \u274c No free plan Paid plans Start at $5/month Start at $99/month per user Supported social media channels Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, Google Business, Mastodon, Start Page, YouTube Shorts, Threads, Bluesky, Shopify Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest (image only), YouTube, Threads Mobile apps \u2705 iOS, Android \u2705 iOS, Android Content planning \u2705 Create Space (on all plans, including free) \u2705 OwlyGPT (paid plans only) Engagement \u2705 Paid plans only \u2705 Paid plans only Analytics, Insights, Reporting \u2705 Free plan (basics) and paid plans (advanced) \u2705 Paid plans only Team members \u2705 Paid plans only \u2705 Paid plans only AI-assisted content generation \u2705 Buffer AI Assistant (all plans, unlimited use) \u2705 OwlyWriterAI (all plans, limited tokens) Social listening \u274c \u2705 Paid plans only Website/link-in-bio tool \u2705 Start Page (on all plans, including Free) \u2705 Paid plans only Plans and pricing The cost of a tool is a dealbreaker for many, so let's talk about the starkest difference between Buffer and Hootsuite right up front: the price. This is particularly important when some of your essential features might only be available on specific plans or cost extra. Here's a big-picture look at the pricing structure for both tools. Buffer pricing Free plan (up to 3 social media accounts/channels) \u2014 $0 Essentials plan \u2014 $5 per channel per month, paid annually (or $6 paid monthly) Team plan \u2014 $10 per channel per month, paid annually (or $12 paid monthly) See Buffer's full pricing guide here \u2192 Hootsuite pricing Standard plan \u2014 $99 per user per month, paid annually (or $149 paid monthly) Advanced plan \u2014 $249 per user per month, paid annually (or $399 paid monthly) Enterprise plan \u2014 Contact for pricing See Hootsuite's full pricing guide here \u2192 What this means for you Buffer and Hootsuite approach pricing from different angles, which directly affects what you\u2019ll pay at the start and how costs increase as your needs expand. For creators: Hootsuite doesn't offer a free option, so you'll pay at least $99 per month to manage up to 5 social accounts. Buffer gives you 3 social channels at no cost, and if you need more, paid plans start at just $5 per month per channel. For teams: Hootsuite\u2019s pricing grows with each user, while Buffer\u2019s grows with each channel. A team with two users and two social media channels would cost you $198 per month on Hootsuite (or $298 if you pay monthly). With Buffer, you'd pay $20 per month (or $24 monthly). You can have unlimited users on the Team plan. Free trials Both Buffer and Hootsuite offer free trials of their plans, so you can put pretty much all of the above to the test without paying a cent. Buffer free trial: 14 days on Essentials and Teams plans. (Remember, you can use up to three social media channels on Buffer's forever-free plan.) Hootsuite free trial: 30 days on their Standard and Advanced plans, after which you'll be charged $99 or $249 per user month, respectively. Ease of use How simple the tool is plays a big role in whether you can hit the ground running or spend time wrestling with it. The faster you feel comfortable inside a tool, the faster you can focus on your content strategy. Buffer: There\u2019s no wasting time with Buffer \u2014 you can connect your social media accounts, set up a posting queue, and start publishing right away. The onboarding flow walks you through how to draft and publish content, so you're ready to go within minutes of signing up. Hootsuite: Hootsuite's social media management tools boast some handy additional features (like paid posts), and it\u2019s a powerful platform for managing your entire social media presence. This also means there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve to make sure you get the most bang for your buck. You can expect to spend some time figuring out where to find different features and how to use them. I definitely had to make a few trips to their knowledge base to find my way around. Social media planning and scheduling Both Buffer and Hootsuite are comprehensive social media scheduling tools and offer a social media content calendar and queue system that will help you easily plan and schedule your posts. Let's dive into the details of how each tool handles planning and scheduling your social posts. Available channels You can connect multiple social media accounts and manage them from a single dashboard on both Hootsuite and Buffer. Here's a quick breakdown of the various social media platforms each tool supports: Buffer Hootsuite Facebook \u2705Pages and Groups \u2705Pages only Instagram \u2705 Creator, Business, and Personal profiles \u2705 Business and Creator profiles only TikTok \u2705 Personal and Business accounts \u2705 YouTube \u2705 \u2705 LinkedIn \u2705 \u2705 X/Twitter \u2705 \u2705 Threads \u2705 \u2705 Pinterest \u2705 \u2705 Bluesky \u2705 \u274c Mastodon \u2705 \u274c Google Business Profile \u2705 \u274c WhatsApp \u274c \u2705 Buffer supports organic social media management across all its available channels. Hootsuite offers the same for organic posts and also includes tools for managing paid ad campaigns on Facebook, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter. Creating and scheduling posts Both Buffer and Hootsuite cover the essentials of content creation and post scheduling \u2014 things like calendar views, bulk scheduling, crossposting across platforms, AI assistance \u2014 but the details differ. Some of the differences between the platforms may be a deal breaker for some social media managers and creators. Posting across platforms: Both Buffer and Hootsuite make it easy to draft a post once and share it across multiple accounts in one go. You can also tweak the text or images for each channel at this step, so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch every time you want to post the same content to a different channel. Bulk scheduling posts: If you're sharing hundreds of posts across channels, you can bulk schedule your posts on both channels, with a few differences in limitations. Buffer supports uploading and scheduling up to 100 posts at a time from a CSV file on paid plans, which should cover most needs for creators and small teams. If you have more to upload, you can simply upload a second CSV file, since there is no limit on how many you can keep in your queue. Hootsuite raises the bulk upload cap to 350 posts, and you\u2019ll need their Advanced or Enterprise plans to access this feature. For large teams managing a heavy posting schedule, that extra capacity can be helpful. AI assistance: Both tools have AI built right into the composer. Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant is available on every plan, even the free one, with no cap on how many posts or ideas you can generate. Hootsuite\u2019s OwlyWriterAI is included on paid plans, but it comes with limits, so you\u2019ll need to be more selective about when you use it. Here's a comparison of the post composer window in both Buffer and Hootsuite for scheduling an Instagram Reel and TikTok. Scheduling an Instagram Reel and TikTok with Buffer Scheduling an Instagram Reel and TikTok with Hoosuite Cover images for short-form video: Hootsuite doesn\u2019t let you select covers or thumbnails for Instagram Reels created from Creator accounts or TikTok videos. This may not work for you if you want control over how your video appears in your grid. Crossposting to Pinterest: On Hootsuite, you can\u2019t crosspost directly to Pinterest. Pins are handled differently from posts on other platforms, so you have to create and schedule them separately. Calendar views: Both tools include a calendar, but the layouts aren\u2019t the same. Buffer shows you channel-specific posts in both week and month views, so you can see exactly what\u2019s planned. Hootsuite gives you the post details in its calendar week view. In the month view, you can see post status, like how many posts are scheduled, but not which platforms they're for. Hashtag support: Buffer doesn\u2019t have hashtag recommendations built into the composer like Hootsuite. Instead, it offers a free Instagram hashtag generator that anyone can use, even without an account. Inside the app, Buffer offers a hashtag manager, which lets you save and organize groups of hashtags to quickly drop into your posts. Capturing ideas and content planning Planning ahead looks different depending on the tool you use. Buffer provides a dedicated space to gather and organize social media content ideas, while Hootsuite leans on AI to help spark and shape them. Buffer: On the plannin",

      "content_text": "On many social media platforms, verification means a paid subscription \u2014 or being a celebrity. But on Bluesky (as is par for the course), things look a little different. The decentralized platform is blazing a new blue check trail: one that mixes top-down trust with community credibility. Whether you\u2019re a journalist, creator, brand, or just someone who wants to prove they\u2019re actually who they say they are online, here\u2019s what you need to know about how verification works on Bluesky \u2014 and how to get it. Jump to a section: The 2 layers of verification on Bluesky The new Bluesky blue badge How to get a verified badge on Bluesky Self-verification on Bluesky How to self-verify on Bluesky Still new to Bluesky? The 2 layers of verification on Bluesky Bluesky currently offers two main verification options: A traditional verification (blue check) from Bluesky Self-verification The former, introduced in April 2025 by Bluesky, works a bit like notable figure verification on Instagram . The platform grants this if you meet certain criteria. Interestingly, you can also be verified by Blueksy\u2019s new \u2018 trusted verifiers \u2019 \u2014 or even apply to be one. More on this below. Self-verification , on the other hand, has been around on Bluesky for a while. Over 270K accounts have already verified this way. It requires you to own a web domain (basically, have a website), and it effectively connects your Bluesky account to your site, even changing your Bluesky handle to match \u2014 no more \u2018bsky.social.\u2019 It\u2019s not a badge or a checkmark, but it\u2019s a solid signal of authenticity. Fun fact: You can even have both a blue check and be self-verified on Bluesky, like CEO Jay Graber is: Here\u2019s a little more about each verification system and how to get verified on Bluesky via both routes. The new Bluesky blue badge Bluesky recently introduced visual verification badges, the familiar little checkmark next to your name, for accounts it deems both authentic and notable . These are issued proactively by Bluesky or \u2014 and here comes the twist \u2014 those trusted verifiers I mentioned earlier. As trusted verifiers, organizations like The New York Times, Wired, and CNN get a special, scalloped blue check on their profiles and can grant badges to others. So if you\u2019re a journalist at the NYT, you could get a blue check from your employer instead of waiting for Bluesky HQ to approve you. You can even tap on any blue badge to see who granted it. How to get a verified badge on Bluesky Right now, getting verified on Bluesky requires filling out this application form . It\u2019s a simple Google form, which the company says it will refine. \u201cOur criteria for verification is evolving based on user feedback,\u201d the company says. \u201cWe will continue to expand the scope of accounts that are eligible for verification over time.\u201d These are the current criteria for Bluesky verification: Your account must be active and secure: Your profile must have a complete bio, a profile photo, and show regular activity Two-factor authentication is strongly recommended for account security Your account must comply with Bluesky's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines Your account must be authentic: Your account must represent a real person, registered business, organization, or legitimate entity Your handle and display name should clearly align with your real identity or business Your account must be the unique presence of the person or business it represents If you have an official website, it should link to your Bluesky account You should be notable: You, or your account, must be notable within your field and geographic region We take into account various indicators of notability, which may include professional recognition, media coverage in established publications, presence on credible reference platforms, or other evidence of public interest Each verification category may have specific notability criteria relevant to that field \u201cWe consider the overall context and public interest value of each account. Please provide links and evidence that can help us ensure that your account meets notability criteria,\u201d the company says. If you tick all those boxes, fill out the form linked above. Be sure to have all the evidence you need handy \u2014 links to organic appearances on media outlets and the like will strengthen your case. Self-verification on Bluesky This was the original method of verifying your identity on Bluesky. It lets you use a domain you own as your handle \u2014 for example, @yourwebsite.com. This approach connects your social presence with your official web presence, making impersonation harder. Buffer\u2019s Joel Gascoigne ( @joel.is \u202c) and Hailley Griffis ( @hailley.co ) have gone this route \u2014 notice how neat their handles are. We\u2019ve also experimented with verifying some Bufferoos with Buffer\u2019s domain, which worked out pretty well too \u2014 here\u2019s mike@buffer.com (Michael Eckstein, our Product Marketer). Here\u2019s how it reflects on their profiles: With this option, you won\u2019t get a blue check mark, but it\u2019s a clear signal that you are who you say you are on the network. Here\u2019s how CEO Jay Graber explains it on the Bluesky blog : \u201cCustom domain handles are a decentralized way for us to achieve a level of account verification. Curious if \u2018@potus.bsky.social\u2019 is actually the president of the US? Once this feature fully lands, you should assume the actual president of the US would have an official domain handle like \u2018@potus.whitehouse.gov\u2019. There are other perks to going this route as well: You can use the same handle to identify you across social networks \u201cI own jaygraber.com , so if I set my handle to @jaygraber.com on Bluesky, I can tell my friends to find me at this stable handle across any AT Protocol social site that supports custom domains,\u201d Jay explains. You can keep a custom domain handle when you switch services. Bluesky is just one network built on AT Protocol \u2014 and the company\u2019s goal is to make it easier for users to switch to others. So, as Jay explains, \u201cif you\u2019re currently using the bsky.social, but you decide you don\u2019t like our policies and want to switch to another, you\u2019ll be able to keep the same domain handle.\u201d How to self-verify on Bluesky If you own a domain, you can set it as your Bluesky handle right now \u2014 no application. Here\u2019s how. Open Bluesky on desktop or mobile, then: Go to Settings > Account. Choose Handle . Click or tap the \u2018 I have my own domain\u2019 button and enter your domain Navigate to your domain registrar, which is the company you bought your domain from (Wix, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.). The specific steps here will depend on the company, but you\u2019ll want to navigate to DNS management for your domain. Pro tip: check under an \u201cAdvanced DNS\u201d tab. If you get stuck, the customer support team from your provider will be able to help. Return to Bluesky and tap the \u2018 Verify DNS record\u2019 button. Once confirmed, click Update to your new domain-based handle. Keep the current menu open \u2014 you\u2019ll need to copy over some details to your DNS record in your domain\u2019s settings (this varies by provider). This change may take a few hours to reflect, so sit tight if it doesn\u2019t appear immediately \u2014 it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you did anything wrong. If you have questions about the process, Bluesky\u2019s technical guide has more. We\u2019re also happy to help on Bluesky if you get stuck \u2014\u00a0you\u2019ll find us at @buffer.com .

      "content_text": "LinkedIn has come a long way from being just \u201cthe world's largest professional network.\u201d In 2025, it\u2019s where professionals build personal brands, brands find their audiences, and creators grow through connection. And sometimes, these three things overlap, as I've experienced in my time on the platform. Whether you're hiring, crafting LinkedIn posts, or planning a marketing campaign, understanding how people use LinkedIn in 2025 \u2014 and how the platform is evolving \u2014 can give you a serious edge. We\u2019ve pulled together top LinkedIn statistics from trusted industry sources and Buffer\u2019s own data to help you make more strategic decisions this year. Let\u2019s get into the numbers. LinkedIn by the numbers: How big is the platform? Before we dive into strategy, let\u2019s take a look at who\u2019s actually using LinkedIn in 2025 \u2014 and how big the platform really is. LinkedIn has over 1 billion members LinkedIn now has more than 1 billion members across 200+ countries and regions, making it the largest professional social networking site in the world. DataReportal puts the figure closer to 1.2 billion, showing consistent year-over-year growth. And that number is only expected to grow, with future trends from Statista forecasting an increase of 22.3% between 2024 and 2028. \ud83d\udca1 Note: The social media platform does not publish statistics about its monthly active users and we didn't find any reliable sources for comprehensive data. The U.S. has the highest LinkedIn audience reach The United States leads with 239 million people with a LinkedIn profile, followed by India with 155 million, together making up a considerable portion of LinkedIn\u2019s global community. However, the social media platform\u2019s reach stretches far beyond North America. Europe and Asia combined account for over half of LinkedIn\u2019s users. Europe accounts for about 314 million users Asia-Pacific contributes approximately 343 million users Latin America makes up about 196 million users Africa and the Middle East combined contribute around 74 million members, with Africa itself adding a notable chunk via countries like Nigeria (~10 million) and South Africa (~15 million) If your audience spans markets outside the U.S., you\u2019re tapping into a massive, diverse professional audience. Europe and Asia alone account for over half of LinkedIn users worldwide. Africa\u2019s numbers may seem smaller by comparison, but they\u2019re growing and represent major opportunities in emerging markets. Source: LinkedIn LinkedIn sees 1.4 billion website visits per month According to Semrush , LinkedIn.com received 1.4 billion visits in May 2025 alone. Even though LinkedIn has a more focused purpose than other social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok, its steady stream of traffic proves one thing: professionals are spending time here, and that time adds up. Source: Semrush 56.9% of LinkedIn users identify as male; 43.1% as female Statista reports that 56.9% of users identify as male, while 43.1% identify as female. Gender distribution is gradually improving, but men still feature more prominently on the platform. Source: Statista \ud83d\udca1 Note : The data only included binary gender options (male and female). No additional gender identities were captured or reported. Millennials and Gen Z make up the core of the platform\u2019s age distribution Professionals aged 25\u201334 make up over 47% of LinkedIn users worldwide \u2014 the largest age group on the platform. The next largest cohort is 18\u201324 year-olds at 29%, with the rest split among users aged 35\u201354. Source: Statista Now that we know who\u2019s on LinkedIn, let\u2019s look at what they\u2019re actually doing once they log in. How people are using LinkedIn Thanks to its clear focus as a professional network, it\u2019s safe to say that most LinkedIn users are logging in with clear intent. Here\u2019s what the latest LinkedIn statistics tell us about how people actually use the platform in 2025. LinkedIn users clock in an average of 51 minutes per month LinkedIn users are fairly active on the platform. DataReportal shows that users clock in an average of 51 minutes per month using the platform via mobile. This might seem modest compared to platforms like Instagram or TikTok, but remember, the average session on LinkedIn is purposeful. Users show up to do something: update their LinkedIn profile, comment on an industry post, search for a job, or follow up on a connection. 49 million people search for jobs on LinkedIn every week LinkedIn\u2019s roots as a career development platform remain strong. A good portion of LinkedIn's user base is job hunting, and 49 million of them show up every week, with users ranking job search as their number one reason for logging in. That\u2019s good news for both recruiters and businesses trying to attract talent through organic content. So take this as your sign to keep your company page updated and active \u2014 job seekers will check it. 40% of LinkedIn visitors engage with a page every week Organic engagement is alive and well on LinkedIn. According to data from the platform , 40% of visitors engage with a company page weekly, whether that\u2019s following the page, liking a post, or clicking through to learn more. That level of organic interaction, even without trying out any LinkedIn advertising tools, is increasingly rare on social media for branded content, which is why LinkedIn still stands out for brand growth. LinkedIn Premium is growing fast LinkedIn\u2019s paid offering is also seeing momentum. As of the third quarter of 2025, there are 175 million Premium users , up from 154 million in 2022, and that number keeps climbing as the platform's users do. For individual creators and businesses alike, this signals increasing investment in the platform \u2014 people are willing to pay for more access, better tools, and higher visibility. But it\u2019s not just individuals using LinkedIn. Brands are showing up in a big way \u2014 and the numbers prove it. How brands and marketers are using LinkedIn While LinkedIn might have started as a tool for job seekers, it\u2019s become one of the most powerful platforms for brand-building, especially for B2B companies, solo creators in professional fields, and in-house marketing teams. Here\u2019s what LinkedIn stats show about how brands are showing up and getting results on the social media platform in 2025. More than 69 million companies are listed on LinkedIn With 69 million+ companies on the platform, it\u2019s clearly now expected \u2014 not optional \u2014 for a business to be discoverable on LinkedIn. These pages act as the homepage for your employer brand, content strategy, and job listings. And it\u2019s not just for big companies \u2014 solo creators and freelancers are building credibility through LinkedIn pages too. Look no further than Sophie Miller , founder of Pretty Little Marketer , who grew her company page to 310,000+ followers and personal account to 213,000+ followers 40% of users engage with business pages weekly LinkedIn reports that 40% of users interact with business pages every week \u2014 a rare stat in the age of declining organic reach. That could mean following a page, liking a post, or clicking through to a website. For brands trying to stay top-of-mind, this level of regular engagement is gold. Pages that post weekly see 5.6x more follower growth LinkedIn\u2019s own data shows that pages that post weekly get 5.6x more follower growth . But even for individual creators, frequency matters. Consistency signals relevance to the algorithm and your audience. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more: Consistent Posting Means 5x More Likes, Comments, and Shares: Study How content performs on LinkedIn It\u2019s one thing to post on LinkedIn \u2014 it\u2019s another to post strategically . What gets reach, clicks, and comments on this platform isn\u2019t always what works on TikTok, Instagram, or even X. Based on recent data (and Buffer\u2019s own experiments), here\u2019s what\u2019s performing well on LinkedIn in 2025. 1.3 million feed updates are viewed every minute According to LinkedIn, users view over 1.3 million feed updates every minute , showing just how much content flows through the platform. But here\u2019s the twist: only a small percentage of users contribute, which means more space for those who do. It\u2019s easy to get eyes on your content as long as you\u2019re consistently sharing helpful, relevant content. LinkedIn has the highest engagement rate of any major social platform Buffer\u2019s 2025 engagement data shows that LinkedIn leads all major platforms in average engagement rate \u2014 clocking in at 6.50%. Even more notably, engagement on LinkedIn is steadily rising. In January 2024, the platform had a median engagement rate of 6.00%. By January 2025, that number had grown to 8.01%. If you\u2019ve been wondering whether LinkedIn is \u201ctoo crowded\u201d to grow on, the numbers tell a different story. There\u2019s still plenty of opportunity, especially for consistent, educational content that encourages conversation. \ud83d\udcda Read more : LinkedIn Leads in Engagement at 6.50% \u2014 Here\u2019s How Other Platforms Stack Up Weekdays are the best day to post on LinkedIn When it comes to ranking content, the LinkedIn algorithm works like most social platforms. It considers factors like engagement to decide which posts to show to each user. If you're trying to maximize engagement, timing matters \u2014 and Buffer\u2019s data shows that Tuesdays through Thursdays around 10\u201311 a.m. are the sweet spot for most accounts.

      "content_text": "For a long time, I treated LinkedIn like a platform to drop the occasional career update \u2014 not a platform to share original ideas, let alone daily posting. But over time, something shifted. LinkedIn started to feel less corporate and more human. The rise of video content brought in a new wave of creators; and suddenly, the platform I\u2019d mentally filed away as too buttoned-up started to feel like a space I could experiment in. Right around the same time, Buffer launched Creator Camp ; a 30-day community challenge to help creators stay consistent with daily prompts. That made the decision to invest in LinkedIn even easier. And then joining the Buffer team this year \u2014 where we\u2019re on a mission to help creators and small businesses get off the ground and grow \u2014 gave me even more reason to lean in. Since August 2024, I\u2019ve posted on LinkedIn every single day without missing a beat. There were plenty of days where motivation was low and showing up felt like a stretch, but I did it anyway. Here\u2019s how I committed to LinkedIn consistency , even on the days I didn\u2019t feel like showing up. I started with a strong why Before I ever committed to posting daily on LinkedIn, I knew I needed a reason that would hold up \u2014 not just on the good days, but on the boring, low-energy, what\u2019s-the-point days, too. For me, that reason was visibility. I wanted to build trust over time and stretch my brand beyond a role, a company, or a chapter of life. I\u2019ve spent my career growing brands from behind the scenes \u2014 telling their stories, scaling their presence, building the playbooks; and I\u2019m proud of that work. But a hard truth hit me during a layoff a few years ago: I realized that while I had been pouring energy into growing other brands, I hadn\u2019t been thinking about my own. There was no lasting signal of my contributions, no clear digital proof of what I stood for or how I thought. No audience of my own that associated me with the results I had helped create. That moment rewired something in me. I realized I\u2019d been playing small, and underinvesting in the credibility of my own name. So I got clear. I wanted to build a personal brand on LinkedIn that did four things: Signaled my skills and point of view clearly Attracted like-minded marketers and collaborators Created a pipeline for paid side projects and consulting Let me run experiments on my own terms, without approval bottlenecks In doing so, I wanted to design long-term leverage for future job opportunities. Once I had that clarity, showing up on LinkedIn became easier because I knew exactly why it mattered to stay consistent. I defined my content pillars early on One of the most helpful things I did early on was define my content pillars. Instead of figuring it out on the fly, I sat down, mapped them out, and made the investment upfront. When your themes are clear, creating content doesn\u2019t feel like grasping in the dark. You\u2019re not relying on bursts of motivation or waiting around for inspiration to strike. You\u2019ve built the rails, now you just keep the wheels turning. For me, those lanes were: Personal branding \u2014 the craft I\u2019ve built and something I now help others with Marketing lessons \u2014 a direct product of my day-to-day and the experiments I run Self-improvement \u2014 inspired by years of podcasting and personal development Corporate humor \u2014 a pressure release valve that invites a laugh when things get too heady Each of these came naturally to me. I didn\u2019t choose them because they were trendy. I chose them because I could speak to them from lived experience, and draw from them even on low-motivation days. Once my pillars were in place, it became easier to build clusters of subtopics under each. Over time, as I posted more content around my pillars and the topic clusters within each pillar, the themes created a heat map of sorts. Leaning into data, I could see which areas (topics) glowed brightest based on performance, and which ones I wanted to build on further. That data backed feedback loop \u2014\u00a0what resonated most with my audience \u2014 made it easier to stay creative and consistent, even when I didn\u2019t feel like being \u201con.\u201d I built a system that fueled motivation, not burnout A strategy without a system is like cola without the fizz. Who enjoys flat soda? Not me! This was one of those upfront investments that paid off fast: I knew that if I could build a system that scaled, I\u2019d free myself up to focus on the actual creating \u2014 not just busy work. Unsurprisingly, Buffer was at the heart of it. Built by creators, for creators; it became my engine. Most Fridays, I batch-created everything for the coming week and scheduled it out so it could run in the background while I focused on everything else. (Shoutout to Buffer\u2019s four-day workweek for giving me the space to thrive in my role and as a creator!) That, combined with the \u201cStreaks\u201d feature in Buffer , turned consistency into a game. Who likes their Streak at risk? Also not me! A snapshot of my Buffer calendar for LinkedIn content planning. This system gave me enough breathing room to manually post over the weekend if I wanted to \u2014 and while I gave myself permission not to post on weekends, I always ended up doing it anyway. The pressure was off, but the habit was there. I experimented with formats, but led with what felt sustainable When I first committed to showing up on LinkedIn, I gave myself one rule: keep it simple. I focused exclusively on text-based posts. No graphics. No carousels. No video. This wasn\u2019t about playing small, but about protecting my creative energy. I wanted to go deep on one medium before diversifying across formats. For me, writing has always come naturally, and I knew that if I could build momentum there, everything else could layer on later. That self-permission was foundational. It took the pressure off and gave me a lane I could stick to, especially on low-energy days. At Buffer, we often talk about choosing consistency over perfection, and that\u2019s exactly how I approached my content. I didn\u2019t need to do it all from day one. I just needed to keep showing up in a way that felt sustainable. Eventually, I found my rhythm. As my audience grew, so did the opportunities \u2014 sponsored content requests started rolling in , some static , some video. That\u2019s when I dipped into video creation. I pushed my edges gently, played with new formats, and saw strong reception. One of the sponsored LinkedIn posts I did for the brand Tracksuit. But I didn\u2019t pivot to video entirely. I stayed honest about what was scalable for me. Video became a supporting act, not the whole show. That balance \u2014 of evolving without pressure \u2014 is what helped me stay consistent, motivated, and creatively fulfilled. I seasoned my content with AI In a recent internal content creation workshop I held at Buffer, I explored the idea of content as pasta. You decide what kind of pasta you want to make \u2014 the shape, the texture, the base ingredients. That\u2019s your raw idea. And then comes the seasoning: salt, pepper, olive oil. That\u2019s where AI comes in. Snapshot of the ice-breaker slide from the recent content creation workshop I held at Buffer. Once I had a clear sense of what I wanted to say on LinkedIn, I used AI as a flavor enhancer. I leaned on it for structure, inspiration, and expansion. The more personality I fed into it, the more my tone of voice came through in return. At first, it felt a bit clunky. The early drafts were stiff, sometimes overcooked. But over time, as I kept feeding AI more of me \u2014 my cadence, my word choices, my preferred formats \u2014 the content started to flow faster, and feel more like mine. One of my favorite ways to use AI was for idea extension. If a post performed well, I\u2019d ask: What else could I write next that builds on this theme? Or: What\u2019s a natural sequel that would deepen this conversation? That curiosity loop helped me create momentum at scale, without reinventing the wheel. Using AI this way kept my content engine moving , and was especially helpful when my own energy dipped. I added low-effort content to my strategy to make posting easier When I initially mapped out my content pillars, I was intentional about balance, but I didn\u2019t want every post to demand deep storytelling or high-stakes thought leadership. I needed space to play. That\u2019s why I added a lighter-touch pillar to the mix: corporate humor . One of the many corporate humor focused posts on my LinkedIn. Not everything needs to be a layered strategy breakdown or a personal transformation. Sometimes, value looks like a moment of levity \u2014 a well-timed meme, a cheeky reflection on remote work, or a post that makes someone laugh between back-to-back meetings. That kind of content brings ease back into the process. It resets your creative energy and gives your audience a reason to engage with you in a more human way. This pillar became my pacing mechanism. A buffer (no pun intended) that kept me consistent without running on empty. I brought my community in A big unlock in my consistency journey was realizing I didn\u2019t have to come up with every idea on my own. Some of the richest content I\u2019ve created has come directly from conversations with my community \u2014 questions in the comments, DMs from peers, reactions to a post that struck a chord. The proof of what resonates is right there, if you\u2019re paying attention. So I leaned in with thoughtful call-to-actions (CTAs), and gave my LinkedIn community something to lean on and engage with. I began asking direct questions, planting intentional call-to-actions (CTAs), and inviting my community to shape the direction of my content. That did two things: It showed my audience I cared about their perspective. It helped me crowdsource the gaps \u2014 the follow-ups, the \u201cwait, but how?\u201d moments \u2014 that I wouldn\u2019t have spotted alone. And bonus: it boosted my engagement. More comments meant more reach, which added fuel to my consistency engine. An overview of how my LinkedIn content performed over the span of a year. Here\u2019s one example: I shared a ",

      "content_text": "Every few months, we take stock of the quiet progress happening across Buffer. These aren\u2019t flashy features or full-on launches \u2014 but they\u2019re the kinds of updates that make everything feel smoother. Lately, the Buffer team has been doubling down on quality (alongside all the headline-grabbing stuff). Here's a look at all the small changes and quality-of-life improvements you'll now find in your Buffer dashboard. How we\u2019ve been improving quality at Buffer Bug fixes and small improvements have always been part of the job. But we're a small team, and in the past, they sometimes had to compete with bigger feature projects. Recently, two teammates \u2014 Adam , our Senior Escalations Manager, and Amanda , our Staff Product Manager for Channels and Platforms \u2014 decided to change that. They introduced several systems to help: Defined timelines for bug fixes : Our highest priority bugs are resolved within 14 days, P2s within 30, and P3s within 60.These timelines help our teams plan their work and help customers know when to expect a fix. Regular refinement sessions : Every two weeks, the team reviews and prioritizes open issues. This keeps focus on the work that matters most. Customer follow-ups : When a bug is fixed, we'll get in touch with the person who reported it to let them know. This closes the loop and we want folks to know how much we appreciate it when they reach out about these things, big or small. Dedicated maintenance time : Around 10% of engineering capacity is set aside for bug fixing and technical housekeeping. It\u2019s planned, not reactive, which keeps progress steady. To make sure this work stays on track, Adam also compiles product quality reports that track the volume, severity, and resolution time of bugs. Those reports help the team see patterns, spot recurring issues, and guide future priorities. All of this adds up! With all these systems in place, Buffer feels more reliable and calm, which goes for both the product and the team. Recent improvements to Buffer Here are just some of the updates that have been shipped over the past few months. \ud83d\udd12 Authentication & Security Improved login verification Fixed a logout bug that appeared after changing passwords on other devices \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f Integrations & Connections Added Zapier support for LinkedIn first comments and Thread topics Made channel settings stay open when switching between channels Recalculated posting streaks when reconnecting a channel Updated the channel refresh modal to show which channels were refreshed \ud83d\udcdd Content Creation & Publishing Made the composer pre-select profiles if you have 3 or fewer channels Made broadcasting more reliable: fewer posts get stuck, and fewer errors appear Fixed link preview issues with shortened URLs Fixed an issue where saving an idea didn\u2019t work in the browser extension \ud83d\udcbb Platform-Specific Enhancements Pinterest: Support for bulk uploads, including a new \u201cBoard Name\u201d column Instagram: Fixed missing address information for Instagram locations LinkedIn: Fixed inconsistencies when adding LinkedIn mentions while editing posts \ud83d\udcf8 Media & Uploads Added support for all crop types in the new uploader Restored missing Instagram crop types \ud83d\udcc6 Calendar & Planning Fixed calendar month view for 53-week years \ud83d\udc65 Account Management Made it possible to transfer organization ownership to another admin Updated payment confirmation emails to link directly to the Stripe invoice We care about product quality, so these small improvements are all a big deal to us. Our goal is for Buffer to be a calm, productive space that makes it easy for you to post consistently on social media. These new systems, fixes, and improvements are essential to making that a reality. It also helps our team. Fewer urgent bugs mean engineers can plan better, communicate more clearly, and work at a sustainable pace. Looking ahead Of course, this isn't a one-and-done job. We'll keep tinkering, following up with customers, and using data and automation to spot friction before it turns into frustration. If Buffer feels smoother lately, this work is the reason. If you notice something that could be better, we'd love to hear about it !

      "content_text": "With its new features and updates, LinkedIn is becoming a social media platform that you shouldn\u2019t overlook, especially if you are a B2B professional or B2B marketer. With more 1 billion members, LinkedIn is now a promising channel for driving traffic, generating quality leads, building your personal brand , and more. Here\u2019s a rundown of the top LinkedIn best practices we\u2019ve found \u2014 everything from figuring out what, when, and how often to post on LinkedIn to learning about your performance, audience, and competitors to maximize your presence on the platform. Whether you\u2019re looking to level up your company\u2019s LinkedIn marketing or use LinkedIn to build a personal brand as a professional, we\u2019ve got you covered. 1. Optimize your LinkedIn Page or profile First things first: don\u2019t cut corners when creating your LinkedIn Page or profile. A complete, well-optimized LinkedIn presence allows your target audience to easily find you on and off LinkedIn (e.g. Google). It should be your first port of call when it comes to LinkedIn best practices. For both company pages and personal profiles, that means having a clear, high-quality profile picture and banner and filling out all the relevant fields. LinkedIn Best practices for Company pages To optimize your Company Page for search, LinkedIn offers these suggestions : Insert keywords for SEO \u201cIncorporate keywords and phrases that potential customers might use to search for your product or service. Include them in the About tab overview, clearly representing who you are and what you do.\u201d There are two places on your profile where you can insert keywords: your company description and specialties. You can find this by navigating to your Company Page > Edit Page > Overview . Link to your Company Page: \"Links are essential for boosting your search ranking,\" The LinkedIn team says. \"An easy win here is to link to your Page from your website. Also, make sure the LinkedIn profiles of employees are up to date.\" On the Buffer website, we link to all our social media profiles, including our LinkedIn Company Page . Share relevant content: \"Share often. The more frequently you share content your followers engage with, the higher your Page will appear in [Google] search results.\" More on this to come! LinkedIn best practices for profiles If you\u2019re trying to build a personal brand on LinkedIn, your first step should be to turn on Creator Mode . This will give you access to a host of powerful tools, including that all-important \u2018Follow\u2019 button. You\u2019ll also be able to choose hashtags or topics to show potential followers what they can expect to see more of in your content. To turn it on, head over to your profile , then under the Resources dashboard , toggle Creator Mode on . Next up: optimizing your LinkedIn profile. Buffer guest poster created a thorough guide of 20+ LinkedIn profile tips that\u2019s well worth reading, but here\u2019s a summary of his top tips: Choose a unique profile picture and banner Write a catchy headline and summary \u2014 don\u2019t be afraid to include emojis to stand out in people\u2019s feeds Write a detailed experience section \u2014 include bullet points of achievements in your role Add skills, endorsements, and recommendations Showcase licenses and certifications \u2014 Bonus tip: take a LinkedIn Skills Assessment to beef up this section To edit all these sections, head over to your LinkedIn profile and click the little pen icons in the top right corner of each area. 2. Pinpoint your target audience One of the first questions in your mind when it comes to LinkedIn marketing might be: What should I post on LinkedIn? Figuring that out starts with understanding who you want to talk to \u2014 an often-missed step in social media strategy . As a business owner or social media marketer, you likely have a solid idea of your target audience thanks to your ideal customer profile (ICP). If you\u2019re uncertain, check out our guide to developing your marketing personas . If you\u2019re looking to define your target audience as a LinkedIn Creator, our guide to creating a personal brand framework will walk you through it. 3. Create content that helps solve your audience\u2019s problems LinkedIn content marketing success calls for so much more than broadcasting your company or professional message to the masses. Your LinkedIn post strategy should start with creating value for your audience . Whether you\u2019re posting from a LinkedIn Page or personal profile, you have to consistently create high-quality content that people want more of. Here\u2019s what LinkedIn recommends: \u201cWhile it can be tempting to sell your audience on the benefits of your product or service, \u2018salesy\u2019 content doesn\u2019t generally perform well on LinkedIn. If there\u2019s one thing LinkedIn members find engaging, it\u2019s a fresh idea. Publishing thought leadership content on your Company Page is one of the most powerful ways to grow your audience. Naturally, you will want to publish and promote your own content, but it\u2019s also a good idea to share engaging and insightful content from others.\u201d In my experience, this starts with understanding what your target audience\u2019s pain points are \u2014 and tapping into your expertise to help solve them. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean consistently posting bland how-to guides \u2014 LinkedIn has evolved from the buttoned-up platform it used to be. As a LinkedIn creator, it means tapping into your real-life stories and experiences to add color to your learnings. You might want to add photos of yourself to your content to help your followers better connect with you (more on this below). Founder and CEO of Growclass Sara Stockdale is a great example of this \u2014 she regularly shares funny, memorable stories to drive home her message. This is true for LinkedIn Company Pages as well. Be guided by your brand tone and style, but don\u2019t be afraid to explore pop culture trends, memes, and GIFs in the way that successful brands like Chili Piper do: 4. Engage with your followers Whether you manage a LinkedIn company page or a personal one, this advice applies. The LinkedIn algorithm prioritizes engagement \u2014 likes, comments, and reposts \u2014\u00a0so encourage your followers to interact simply by thoughtfully responding to their comments. If you\u2019re responding to comments, see if you can continue the conversation by asking them another question in the thread. At Buffer, some of our best-performing content is a question in and of itself, like the one below. Don\u2019t limit your interactions to your own content, either. More than one LinkedIn creator has told me they find their follower count spikes not when they post their own content but when they engage thoughtfully with someone else\u2019s post. A word of caution on this front, though: While this makes sense for those building their own brands on LinkedIn, it might be a little tricky with LinkedIn Company Pages. Jumping into the thread as a brand might come across as pushy or sales-y. On the other hand, if someone has mentioned your brand in their post, responding is a must. LinkedIn offers you an easy way to keep up with mentions, too. Just head over to your page, click Activity on the left-hand side, then choose Mentions . 5. Make use of the analytics Setting up a social media content calendar for LinkedIn isn\u2019t a one-and-done job. It\u2019s an initiative process, and it means checking in on your LinkedIn metrics as often as possible to double down on what\u2019s working and tweak what\u2019s not. LinkedIn Profile Analytics If you\u2019ve turned on Creator Mode, you now have access to a host of great data to tap into. To find it, head over to your LinkedIn profile and click on the View all analytics button on the top left. Here, you\u2019ll find data on four metrics: Post impressions: The number of times your posts were displayed on screen. Followers: The total number of people that currently follow you (including connections and non-connection followers). Profile viewers: The total number of people who viewed your profile. Search appearances: The number of times your profile appeared in search results. Click on each of them to dive deeper. If you\u2019re still fine-tuning your LinkedIn content strategy, check in on post impressions regularly to monitor the performance of your posts. Here, you\u2019ll be able to set a date range and analyze both post impressions and engagement. LinkedIn Page Analytics Besides measuring your LinkedIn marketing performance, your Company Page analytics is a great tool for understanding what valuable content your followers like. To find your LinkedIn analytics, head over to your Page and then click on Analytics on the left-hand side of the window. Here, you\u2019ll find a wealth of information, including: Content: The performance of all your posts, which you can filter by impressions, unique impressions, clicks, reactions, comments, reposts, and engagement rate. Visitors: How many people are viewing your page, which can be filtered by both page views and unique visitors. Followers: An overview of your total followers plus new followers within the last 30 days. You\u2019ll also get a look at your follower demographics. Leads: The details of potential customers you\u2019ve gathered through paid LinkedIn Lead Gen (lead generation) Forms. Competitors: Track and benchmark the performance of your competitors on LinkedIn. You\u2019ll see an overview of their follower metrics, organic content performance, and trending posts. Employee advocacy: Gauge trends in employee and member engagement with content recommended to employees on the My Company tab. Now, this is a lot of data that may be a little overwhelming if you\u2019re new to the platform. In terms of LinkedIn best practices for digital marketing, we recommend keeping an eye on these two things to start: Understand what content does well on your Company Page To find out what content your followers like, go to Analytics > Content. Scroll down to the content engagement table and look for outliers \u2014 both posts with impressions and clicks much higher or lower than the rest of your content. If the post fell flat, try t",

      "content_text": "Social media users are facing some pretty big challenges today. They\u2019re frustrated by being at the mercy of changeable algorithms or having their data sold to the highest bidder. And the idea that, should a platform move in a direction they don\u2019t like (as is the case with some disillusioned folks on X/Twitter) or disappear from the market completely (which would happen in the case of the U.S. TikTok ban ), leaving the network means abandoning everything they\u2019ve worked so hard to build there. Content, poof. Audience, bye-bye. But with all the bad comes so much good : the ability to share your life and work with billions of users all over the world, an outlet for creative expression, the possibility of monetizing your passion, and, perhaps, the most important of all: the ability to share and connect with family and friends. Most social media users \u2014 especially those leveraging the networks to boost visibility for themselves, their businesses, or their work \u2014 accept that the good of social media goes hand-in-hand with the bad. But what if there was an alternative? As it happens, there are several. A wave of new social media platforms has swept onto the market in recent months, offering solutions to many of the problems I\u2019ve mentioned above. They\u2019re federated, decentralized, and growing fast. But what exactly is decentralized social media? Could users find the community they\u2019re looking for? Can creators gain traction there? And can it realistically challenge the centralized giants that dominate the current landscape? Let\u2019s take a closer look. The evolution of decentralized social media While it might feel like it burst onto the scene in 2023/24, decentralized social media isn\u2019t all that new. The first decentralized platform, Diaspora , launched back in 2010. It promises users freedom, privacy, and control of their own data. Despite initial excitement and a successful crowdfunding campaign, Diaspora struggled to gain mainstream traction. Their platform still exists and currently has around 850,000 users. In 2016, Mastodon , an open-source and decentralized microblogging platform, was launched. This was closely followed by Steemit , Pixelfed , Lens Protocol , and several others. Like Diaspora, these networks intially struggled to gain traction \u2014 until now. The advent of blockchain technology and growing disillusionment with traditional social networks have reignited interest in decentralization. 2023 in particular saw a steep rise in interest in decentralized social media options \u2014 and a much talked about phenomenon called the fediverse . And, rather than sputtering and lying dormant, these platforms and new ones like them are slowly, steadily (and sometimes in great spurts that correlate to changes on mainstream platforms) growing their user bases. Mastodon, Pixelfed (an Instagram alternative), PeerTube (a YouTube alternative), and an ever-growing ecosystem are built with an open protocol called ActivityPub. This connection makes them interoperable (read: able to talk to each other). All platforms built with ActivityPub are considered to be part of the fediverse (federation + universe). A \u2018map\u2019 of the fediverse. Source: fediverse.party And, according to David Pierce , The Verge's Editor-at-Large, ActivityPub is worth getting excited about. \u201cIt\u2019s an old standard based on even older ideas about a fundamentally different structure for social networking, one that\u2019s much more like email or old-school web chat than any of the platforms we use now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s governed by open protocols, not closed platforms. It aims to give control back to users and to make sure that the social web is bigger than any single company.\u201d Even Meta\u2019s Threads have plugged into the fediverse, though they themselves aren\u2019t decentralized (more on this to come). Another key player in the decentralized social movement, Bluesky , was launched in 2021. Interestingly, Bluesky has Twitter to thank for its inception \u2014 work on the platform started in 2019, when former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced the company was funding a small team of researchers to build an \u201copen and decentralized standard for social media.\u201d Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack (@jack) December 11, 2019 \u201cThere are MANY challenges to make this work that Twitter would feel right becoming a client of this standard,\u201d Dorsey tweeted at the time. \u201cWhich is why the work must be done transparently in the open, not owned by any single private corporation, furthering the open and decentralized principles of the internet.\u201d That work was fully realized in Bluesky, a network that bears a striking resemblance to a pre-Elon Musk Twitter, and an open protocol to rival ActivityPub, AT Protocol. This makes things a little complicated, so bear with me: Even though Bluesky is decentralized and aligns philosophically with many of the fediverse ideals, Bluesky is not part of the fediverse because it isn\u2019t interoperable with ActivityPub platforms like Mastodon. What is decentralized social media? Unlike the major networks, decentralized social media is not owned and controlled by one colossal tech giant. Instead of data being controlled by a single company, it is distributed across a network of computers, often run by individual users or independent organizations. This means there is no single point of control or failure, which, in theory, boosts privacy and reduces the risk of censorship. It\u2019s like having your cake, eating it, and then realizing your cake can\u2019t be stolen because it\u2019s everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The benefits of decentralization Data ownership and privacy: Users retain control over their data, deciding what to share and with whom. This contrasts sharply with centralized platforms that often monetize user data. Censorship resistance: With no central authority to dictate content rules, decentralized platforms can be more resistant to censorship. This is particularly appealing in regions with restrictive regimes. Community governance: Decisions about platform changes and policies can be made through democratic processes involving the community rather than top-down directives from corporate executives. Buffer founder and CEO Joel Gascoigne likens the movement to return to the open web of the 1990s. \u201cThe Internet was built upon open standards \u2014 HTTP, URL, TCP/IP, DNS, HTML. A vast number of valuable internet businesses have been built on these \u2018shoulders of giants,\u2019\" he says. \u201cActivityPub and AT Protocol are built with open standards philosophies, and could similarly enable a new playground of innovation, with openness, ownership, and interoperability at their core.\u201d \u201cOpen standards in social media could be as powerful as open standards have been for direct and private communication (email). What I find exciting about the development of these open standards, and more importantly, the adoption of them and the traction of social networks which support them, is that they can bring forth a new era of open standards for the web.\u201d David Pierce paints a beautiful picture of exactly what this could mean if ActivityPub or AT Protocol were to take off: \u201cI\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll be better off with a hundred different apps for Snapchat or Instagram or X instead of just one, a dozen companies competing to build the best moderation tools, and an app store filled with different ways for me to follow and be followed by other people on the internet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that we have a dozen usernames, a dozen profiles, a dozen sets of fans and friends. All that stuff should belong to me, and I should be able to access it and interact with it anywhere and everywhere.\u201d A paradigm shift for creators Creators will likely be skeptical of these new networks, and understandably so. Follower count is still currency, especially if you\u2019re looking to monetize. It makes sense to choose your primary platform based on the largest potential audience you can reach. TikTok, for example, with its ever-growing monthly active user count of 1.5 billion, is particularly appealing \u2014 but the risk of placing all your eggs in that basket shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If the ban goes ahead and the platform is removed from U.S. app stores, even creators outside the region could lose hundreds of thousands of followers, not to mention all their content. The promise of decentralized networks, if they live up to their vision, means your audience, no matter where it lives, is yours. Tech experts often liken it to email \u2014 even if you leave Gmail, you\u2019ll still have access to all your contacts there. Your eggs are in many baskets. If you abandon one, there are others. This new reality could mean a powerful mindset shift for creators, Joel points out. \u201cRather than thinking of yourself as, say, an Instagram creator, a YouTube creator, or LinkedIn creator, you\u2019re an image creator, a video creator, a writer. It's an empowering paradigm shift that means your content is always yours, whatever audience you build with that work belongs to you.\u201d It\u2019s worth pointing out, he adds, that there\u2019s no better time to get active on a network than when it experiences its initial spike in interest. \u201cRight now is a very specific moment in time because there's an opportunity to be part of multiple new social networks that are growing rapidly,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting in on the ground floor is a huge benefit.\u201d For those wary of adding yet another platform to their social media stack, it\u2019s worth noting that social media management tools that allow for crossposting ( like Buffer ) do streamline this process a great deal. Posts for LinkedIn, for example, can be easily converted to a simpler thread that might work on Threads or Bluesky. The refreshing community focus In completely anecdotal terms, these decentralized networks tend to be more focused on community and discu",

      "content_text": "Picture this: Your boss is asking you about the business impact of your social media strategy . You know you\u2019ve moved the needle \u2014 brought in website visitors, converted some of them, and nudged brand awareness. But how do you prove it? This is where a social media dashboard comes in handy. It\u2019s a visual representation of the key metrics that prove the impact of your social media efforts. Your job as a social media manager is to convert the raw data of social media metrics into something easily understandable for you, your team, and your executives. But that\u2019s not all it is. A social media marketing dashboard also helps in: Uncovering actionable insights about what kind of social media posts are getting the most traction Finding which social media campaigns are giving you the highest return on investment (ROI) Deciding where you should put your marketing dollars \u2014 for example, you\u2019d like to put more resources behind social media platforms that have an outsized impact This article is a complete guide for creating a social media dashboard: what social media metrics you should monitor, where to get them, how to build helpful data visualizations, and a lot more. A social media dashboard needs to be personalized The most important thing about building a social media reporting dashboard is it should be tailor-made. As social media managers, you likely have to communicate with various stakeholders \u2014 all of whom have different levels of knowledge about your marketing strategy and social media in general. C-suite executives might not know which social media channels the company is active on and why. They might also be unaware of the various features of different social media platforms. However, they also have concerns about whether the marketing dollars are well-spent. So, they need more explainers behind your marketing strategy. You need to add not just the engagement metrics but also prove you\u2019ve made informed decisions to get the value of money & resources. On the other hand, your social media team doesn\u2019t need to know the thought process behind your social media marketing strategy. They likely had an input in formulating it. Their social media reporting dashboard needs to focus more on execution. Perhaps you\u2019re experimenting with a new social media channel \u2014 so you need to create custom reports on how your social media posts are performing here and any valuable insights you\u2019ve derived. Maybe you\u2019re working as a creator on your own business. In this case, your social media dashboard needs to serve only you. You don\u2019t need to include the standard social media metrics since you\u2019re living and breathing them anyway. You need deeper insights about your target audience and what they love. What a social media dashboard displays depends on who\u2019s at the receiving end. Instead of relying on cookie-cutter social media dashboard templates that you have to spend forever tinkering with, it\u2019s a better use of your time to build custom social media dashboards (and their templates) for your unique use case. Here\u2019s everything you need to ask to create the most impactful custom social media dashboards: Who is on the receiving end of this social media dashboard? What do they already know about my social media strategy? What\u2019s their level of knowledge in social media marketing? Which social media analytics do they care about the most? How do they best digest information about social media performance? Answering these questions will help you tailor the scope of your social media dashboard and eliminate unnecessary bloat. The shortcut for creating custom social media dashboards Can you find almost all social media analytics you need natively on your social media accounts? Of course. All social media platforms have in-built performance data. But that\u2019s a lot of busy work. And I mean, a lot. You\u2019ll have to gather raw data from multiple channels > add it to Google Sheets > derive valuable insights by playing around with the numbers > create data visualizations > and put it in a PowerPoint presentation. You can develop the muscle to do this quickly and create social media dashboard templates for recurring reports. If that\u2019s the way that works best for you right now, great! Move ahead to the next section, where there\u2019s a step-by-step guide to follow this process. But there\u2019s a far quicker route you can take: Use a social media analytics software . Analytics tools require you to connect your social media accounts to their software. Then, they aggregate all the real time data from multiple accounts and present it in their own native social media dashboard. You can play around and tinker with the social media metrics here \u2014 filter the ones you need to examine your social media performance and create various custom reports. Most tools also offer the option to brand these reports with your logo, company colors, etc. Take Buffer . We help you track performance and create a social media dashboard for Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn. Using Buffer, you can instantly know: Which types of posts perform the best on your social media channel(s) The best day, time, and frequency to post to maximize your results All key performance indicators analytics you get natively \u2014 follower growth, total reach, engagement metrics, audience demographics, hashtag performance, etc. There are plenty of benefits of using an analytics tool like Buffer (over creating dashboards yourself): You don\u2019t have to collect the data manually. Buffer connects to your data sources and does the gathering task without you lifting a finger. No copy-pasting numbers to a Google Sheet from multiple social media channels. Everything\u2019s already available in a single social media dashboard. You don\u2019t have to hunt for insights. Buffer doesn\u2019t just collect data, it also does the work of analyzing it. Is your engagement rate suffering compared to last month? What\u2019s the best time to post for your social media account? It crunches the numbers and tells you exactly what you (and your manager) need to know. You don\u2019t have to create custom reports yourself. Look, I may be biased, but this is a fact: Buffer\u2019s reports look way better than the same old spreadsheet. It infuses your social media reporting with not just accurate numbers, but the best data visualization. And you can brand it to call it your own. And that\u2019s not all: Buffer can do a whole lot more than build your reporting dashboard. It\u2019s a full-fledged social media management tool that can help you store ideas, schedule social media posts, and respond to comments. Try Buffer for free for yourself . How to build your own social media dashboard in 3 steps If you aren\u2019t ready to take the plunge with analytics tools, here\u2019s a 3-step guide to build your own social media dashboard from scratch. Step 1: Collect all the data you need The first step is collecting all the social media analytics you need to build your dashboard. Your data sources are the native insights on your social media accounts. If you\u2019re tracking website visits, Google Analytics can also help you understand how much traffic comes via social media. \u26a0\ufe0f Note : You can\u2019t view your social media analytics on X (formerly Twitter) if you don\u2019t purchase the blue tick . It has scrapped native insights for non-premium users entirely. All social platforms have varying degrees of depth in their key metrics. Social media pages (like Facebook pages or LinkedIn company pages ) have slightly more thorough info than individual accounts. Here are some important performance metrics present on all social platforms: Total reach Follower count Follower growth Engagement rate Audience demographics Facebook insights are on the Meta Business Suite (for Facebook Pages), for instance. It has all the details about your page followers \u2014 audience demographics, follower growth, link clicks, page visits, etc. You can even benchmark your social media dashboard against similar businesses on Facebook. Similarly, Instagram insights show you data about your Instagram followers. How your audience interacts can differ widely based on the social channel. You might also have different social media goals for different platforms. For example, maybe you use Facebook to build brand awareness and TikTok to increase conversions. Thus, your Facebook social media dashboard focuses more on overall reach, and TikTok\u2019s social dashboard highlights click-through rates and influencer marketing results. Your social media dashboard should shift based on the direction of your niche marketing efforts. Bella Rose Mortel , social media strategist at Beehiiv , says the best metrics to monitor are impressions, follower count, shares, and saves. She explains why: \u201c I think best metrics to monitor are impressions (goal of organic social is always reach and eyeballs), as well as follower count (account growth is an important indicator that you're doing something right), and also shares and saves in content because those are good indicators someone was like \u2018hey look at this piece of content!\u2019 or had the intention to save it to come back to later. \u201d Collect any and all the metrics you\u2019ll need to build your social media dashboard. Where do you collect this data? I recommend Google Sheets because it\u2019s easy to organize your data there. Plus, it\u2019s easy to transfer to data visualization tools. Instead of copy-pasting, you can also download analytics reports from social platforms and export them to Google Sheets. You\u2019ll have your sheets divided on a channel basis rather than a timeline basis. , Pro-tip : You can shift the approach of collecting your data based on the goal behind your social media analytics dashboard. For example: Instead of having sheets based on timelines (like I have templated above), you can also segregate your data collection based on each individual social channel \u2014 one tab for Facebook, another for TikTok, a third for Instagram, etc. If you have a strong advertising strategy , you can approach data collection based on y",

Here\u2019s how to participate without burning out your audience. Make it your own with visuals, story, or structure Instagram rewards originality \u2014 even when you're using a trending track or format.

You might be surprised to hear it. The more information you have, the better you can tailor your social media strategy, right? Well, not exactly. Not all social media metrics are created equal, and which ones to focus on comes down to your specific social media goals. You might be testing a new format, tracking audience growth, or trying to understand how people interact with your posts. And while it\u2019s tempting to track everything, more data doesn\u2019t always mean more clarity. Metrics are most helpful when they guide your next move \u2014 whether that\u2019s adjusting your content, switching up your posting schedule, or even thinking up new products. In this guide, I\u2019ll walk you through 12 social media metrics that are especially worth a look at in 2025, when they\u2019re most helpful, and how you can use what you learn to support your social media marketing goals . What are social media metrics? Social media metrics are the numbers you look at to see how your content is performing against your social media goals. Any time you check how many people liked a post, clicked a link, or followed your account, you\u2019re working with social media metrics. Each one tells its own story about your content\u2019s reach and impact. You may hear people refer to them as \u201csocial media KPIs\u201d or key performance indicators. They sound similar, but they aren\u2019t exactly the same. Metrics include every single thing you can measure on your social media channels. KPIs are the specific metrics you\u2019ve chosen to track towards your goals. Let\u2019s look at the key metrics that deserve your attention. Social media metrics that show what\u2019s landing Some metrics help you get a better sense of how people are responding to your content. When you track these specific signals, you start to see clear patterns in what your audience enjoys and comes back for. 1. Engagement rate Engagement rate tells you how much your audience is interacting with your content \u2014 not just seeing it, but actively responding to it. Things like likes, comments, shares, or saves all count towards engagement rate. It\u2019s a quick way to understand whether your content is catching people\u2019s attention and prompting them to respond. Engagement rate is expressed as a percentage you can calculate with this formula: Freelance social media marketer Rebecca Broad uses this metric as a gut check while creating content. \u201cKeeping engagement rate in mind means I constantly assess visuals and copy and ask \u2018why would anyone care?\u2019\u201d says Rebecca. \u201cWhy would someone who sees this post stop scrolling, and spend precious time and energy engaging with it?\u201d It\u2019s a perspective that can help you keep your audience at the center of every creative decision. You can track engagement rate: for a single post across a campaign over time on a platform Each view gives you slightly different insights \u2014 from how well a specific piece of content landed to how your audience is engaging week over week. Post engagement rate Post engagement rate shows you which posts are making people stop and react \u2014 not just scroll by. This type of social media engagement also tells the algorithm your content is worth sharing more widely, though they\u2019re often weighted slightly differently on each platform. For example, shares (especially in DMs) are a strong signal to the Instagram algorithm . Meaningful comments carry weight on LinkedIn , especially when they get a conversation going. Track this metric when: you're experimenting with new content formats you're promoting a message you want to stand out you want to keep a general eye on what your audience responds to How to use post engagement metrics When you see a spike in engagement, don\u2019t stop at the number \u2014 figure out what\u2019s behind it. Was the post tied to a trending topic? Did you ask a question that got people talking? Did the visual pop in the feed? Those are the kinds of clues that can guide what you post next. And if something really clicks, look for ways to repurpose it elsewhere \u2014 Rebecca often reworks strong LinkedIn posts into blog CTAs (calls to action). On the flip side, if engagement is low, that\u2019s your cue to experiment. Change up the format, try a different tone, or shift your focus and see what sticks. Campaign engagement rate When you want to know how an entire social media campaign is landing \u2014 messaging, post timing , and creatives \u2014 campaign engagement rate gives you the full picture. Because campaigns often span multiple formats and run over several days, this metric can reveal patterns you may not spot while looking at individual social media posts alone. Track this metric when: you're launching a new product or service you're running a seasonal promotion ( Black Friday + Cyber Monday , anyone?) you're raising awareness on a topic How to use campaign engagement metrics For brands, campaign engagement rate is a helpful way to adjust your approach mid-campaign. If engagement\u2019s low, you might rethink your next post or shift your ad spend. It\u2019s also a practical way to test influencer or creator partnerships before making bigger commitments in future campaigns. Creators can include strong campaign engagement rates in pitches and media kits . A solid campaign engagement rate shows brands that you won\u2019t just get them in front of people \u2014 you\u2019ll get people talking, following, and maybe even buying. For a brand looking for its next partner, that kind of result stands out. Platform engagement rate Platform engagement rate gives you a broader view of how your content is performing across an entire social media platform. When you track this over time, you\u2019ll start to see whether your audience is still responding or if engagement is beginning to dip. Track this metric when: you\u2019re evaluating whether your overall social strategy is working or needs a shift you want to know if the platform is still worth your time, or if your focus might be better placed elsewhere How to use platform engagement metrics If engagement is steady or trending up, it\u2019s a sign that the platform is worth continued time and effort. If it starts to fall, it could mean your content needs a refresh, your posting rhythm needs tweaking, or your audience is moving elsewhere \u2014 and it might be worth following them. 2. Average video watch time Average watch time (sometimes called average view duration) is the number of seconds people spend watching your video. It\u2019s one of the clearest video performance metrics \u2014 a higher average watch time means viewers are sticking around for longer. It matters even more on platforms like Instagram and TikTok , where watch time influences what gets recommended or shown to more people. Depending on the platform, you might be able to track average watch time for your full library or just individual videos. YouTube gives you both; Instagram Reels focuses on video-by-video performance. Track this metric when: you\u2019re experimenting with different video lengths or formats you\u2019re comparing video content performance across platforms you want to see which topics or styles keep people watching How to use video engagement metrics A longer average suggests your content is working \u2014 whether it\u2019s the pacing, the topic, or how the video opens. Use that insight to guide what you create next. If people are dropping off early, take a closer look at your hook, story structure, or visual pacing. Small adjustments can make a big difference in how long people stay. Social media metrics for tracking your content\u2019s visibility Content can\u2019t make an impact if no one\u2019s seeing it. Visibility and awareness metrics help you understand how often your posts are being shown, and how far they\u2019re reaching. 1. Reach Reach tells you how many different people saw your post or ad. Each person is counted once, whether they saw that post one time or five times. If a post has a reach of 15,000, that means 15,000 different people saw it. It\u2019s one of the key metrics that Hailley Griffis , Head of Communications and Content at Buffer, tracks. \u201cDifferent communities and social networks will engage differently, but if you are reaching an increased number of people, then you\u2019re doing something right,\u201d says Hailley. Reach helps you compare what formats, topics, or platforms are getting seen the most. Track reach when: you\u2019re testing different formats to see which ones grab more attention you want to understand which topics or messages your audience cares most about you want to see if posting at different times or on different days helps you reach more people you\u2019re reviewing which platforms your audience is most active on How to use reach Just like you did with engagement rate, start by checking which posts had the highest reach, then dig into the context. Was it the topic? The timing? Did someone share it and extend your audience? Hailley reviews her reach every couple of weeks to find these patterns and make small adjustments that add up over time. One thing she\u2019s noticed: showing up regularly makes a difference. \u201cMy reach continues to increase on Threads the more I stay consistent,\u201d says Hailley. \u201cI\u2019ve spotted the same pattern for other creators too. While my Threads engagement is still growing, I\u2019ve also seen increases in overall reach in the last few months of maintaining consistency.\u201d 2. Impressions Impressions count how many times your content is shown on someone\u2019s screen, even if it\u2019s to the same person more than once. For example, say someone taps through to an Instagram post from your stories and then also sees the post in their feed the next time they open the app. This counts as two impressions, even though it\u2019s the same person. It\u2019s easy to confuse impressions with reach, but they measure different things. Reach tracks how many unique people saw your posts. Impressions count all views, including repeat ones. For Meryoli Arias , Head of Social Media at Glide, impressions are a north",

      "content_text": "There are billions of videos on YouTube on, quite possibly, every topic you could think of (and others not even on your radar). You could learn how to cook or code, take a tour of tiny houses or millionaires\u2019 mansions, watch gamers try to reach the Death Star in Fortnite \u2026 the list is endless. Yet every time I open the app, YouTube shows me what I'm most interested in \u2014 music, makeup, and motorsports. It\u2019s easy to see how much content there is on the platform, and how well YouTube seems to know me. What\u2019s harder to understand is how YouTube decides which of the billions of videos I might want to watch. How does the YouTube algorithm know what to recommend? And why do some videos go viral seemingly overnight, while others take a bit more time to find their audience? I decided to find out. In this article, I\u2019ll break down how the YouTube algorithm works according to YouTube insiders and share tips for how to apply this knowledge to your YouTube videos. In a nutshell: There\u2019s no gaming the YouTube algorithm, but there are definitely some ways to work with it as a YouTube creator. If you\u2019re not interested in the technicalities and want specific, practical things you can do right now to help grow your channel and get more views, skip right to the tips section at the end. Jump to a section: What is the YouTube algorithm? YouTube algorithm for recommended content YouTube algorithm for the homepage YouTube algorithm for suggested videos YouTube algorithm for shorts YouTube algorithm for search results 7 tips to work with the YouTube algorithm and boost your content What is the YouTube algorithm? The YouTube algorithm is the behind-the-scenes system that decides which videos YouTube users see when they open the app. It powers recommendations across the platform and plays a big role in whether your videos get discovered. Like other social media algorithms, the YouTube algorithm helps each particular viewer find content they\u2019re likely to enjoy based on a range of signals from watch history to likes and dislikes. There are two ways for YouTube users to discover your videos on the platform: Recommended content \u2014 videos that appear on the homepage, suggested videos that show up next to what someone\u2019s watching, and in the YouTube Shorts feed. Other content \u2014 videos viewers find through search and in the trending videos tab. These aren\u2019t all driven by a single algorithm. Much like the Instagram algorithm , YouTube has different algorithms for each place in the platform that viewers can discover videos. Each one uses its own mix of signals to figure out how valuable a video is to that viewer and what content users want to see more of. Let's unpack how the algorithms in these distinct areas work. YouTube algorithm for recommended content When it comes to long-form videos (not shorts), YouTube\u2019s approach to recommending content is less about pushing videos out and more about figuring out what each particular viewer is likely to pull in. That means it\u2019s YouTube users \u2014 not YouTube \u2014 who are in control of what the algorithm recommends to them. Every time someone watches, skips, likes, or shares a video, they\u2019re helping shape their own feed. YouTube tracks thousands of these actions to decide what shows up next. Todd Beaupr\u00e9, Senior Director of Growth and Discovery at YouTube, shed some light on how the YouTube algorithm finds videos for viewers in a chat with YouTube Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie. A big part of that process, he says, is what YouTube calls satisfaction. \u201cWe're trying to understand not just about the viewer's behavior and what they do, but how they feel about the time they're spending. What do they say about their experience watching a video,\u201d says Beaupr\u00e9. YouTube does this by looking at how users engage with videos and direct feedback it gathers through surveys. Engagement YouTube pays close attention to how people engage with videos \u2014 both through their behavior and through the feedback they give directly. Together, these signals help the algorithm figure out what videos to recommend to users. Some of this happens quietly in the background. According to YouTube themselves , \u201cWe track what viewers watch, how long they watch, what they skip over, and more. This helps us figure out what kind of videos they like best and what we can recommend to them next.\u201d These actions all help shape what shows up in someone\u2019s feed. Engagement isn\u2019t limited to how users behave when watching videos. YouTube also gives users direct control over what they want to see more \u2014 or less \u2014 of. Clicking the three-dot menu under any video opens up options that actively influence future recommendations. When someone adds a video to their queue, saves it to a playlist, or shares it with others, they send a clear signal that they\u2019re interested. And YouTube takes note, recommending more videos like it, or more from that same creator. The Not interested and Don\u2019t recommend channel options work the other way. If someone clicks on either of these user preference signals, they\u2019re telling the algorithm to stop recommending that type of content. All of these signals \u2014 from passive viewing habits to active choices \u2014 help YouTube get a clearer picture of what each user wants to watch and affect how your videos are shown across the platform. Direct feedback YouTube occasionally asks users to share their thoughts through quick feedback surveys that sometimes pop up after watching a video. Source These surveys help YouTube understand satisfaction on a deeper level \u2014 not just what viewers watched, but how they felt about it. The responses can influence both how that video performs and how often similar content appears in their own feeds and in other users' feeds, too. \"We've seen that when we add those [direct feedback] signals into the ranking, it actually leads to people coming back to YouTube more in the long run,\u201d says Beaupr\u00e9. \u201cThat\u2019s really what our goal is.\u201d YouTube algorithm for the homepage When YouTube users open the app or visit youtube.com, they land on the homepage. \u201cIt\u2019s where we aim to deliver the most relevant, personalized recommendations to each viewer,\u201d says YouTube . YouTube displays a mix of content on the homepage, including videos from a viewer\u2019s subscriptions, new videos, and videos that people with similar viewing habits have watched. The recommendations here are based on a combination of: Performance: How well a video has engaged and satisfied other viewers with similar interests. Watch and search history: How often someone watches a channel or similar content, and how many times they\u2019ve already been shown each video. Beaupr\u00e9 calls this \u201cautomating word of mouth\u201d \u2014 the automated version of asking friends and family for recommendations. He explains that the algorithm is able to understand what other viewers with similar interests have watched. When it\u2019s time to recommend videos to a user, it pulls in from that understanding of what similar viewers enjoyed and what they didn\u2019t. YouTube algorithm for suggested videos Suggested videos appear alongside the video a viewer is currently watching, typically on the right side of the screen on desktop. According to YouTube, this section is designed \u201cto offer your audience videos they\u2019re most likely to watch next.\u201d YouTube recommendations for suggested videos are based on both the video someone\u2019s watching and their watch history. You\u2019ll see how this works in the screenshot below. Because I\u2019m watching music from the Phantom of the Opera, YouTube recommends other Phantom of the Opera videos I might want to watch next. It also recommends videos from two other channels I\u2019ve watched before, personalizing the recommendations for me. This means two YouTube users watching the same video might see completely different options in the suggested videos panel. YouTube has added filter buttons above the suggested videos feed so viewers can sort what they see next based on what they\u2019re in the mood for. These buttons will change depending on the video, and can include: From [channel they\u2019re currently watching] From the series Related topics For you Recently uploaded Watched YouTube algorithm for shorts The YouTube Shorts and long-form algorithms serve different formats, but they share a common goal: audience satisfaction, giving viewers more of what they want to watch. Because shorts is a different format, the way people discover and consume content works differently. With longer videos, viewers actively choose what to watch. They can see a video\u2019s title, thumbnail, which channel published it, and how long it is before they click on it. Shorts works more like a discovery feed \u2014 especially on mobile \u2014 where people swipe up through content and find new videos as they scroll. And while viewers can\u2019t choose which short appears next, they can decide whether to keep watching or swipe away when a video shows up in their feed. The YouTube Shorts algorithm looks at: Average video watch time Overall engagement The percentage of viewers who watch instead of swiping away If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how to make your YouTube Shorts land with viewers, we\u2019ve covered how the algorithm works in detail in this article . \u26a1 Schedule your YouTube Shorts ahead of time with Buffer to stay on top of your video game. Start for free \u2192 YouTube algorithm for search results While recommendations drive a lot of views on YouTube, search is another major way people discover content, especially when they\u2019re actively looking for something specific. The YouTube search algorithm offers you a little more control over how your content ranks in search results than the recommendations. It\u2019s a way to get your videos in front of people who are already searching for videos on the topics you\u2019re posting about. \u201cLike Google\u2019s search engine, YouTube search strives to surface the most relevant results according to keyword searches,\u201d YouTube says. \u201cSearch results are not a list of the most-viewed videos for a given search.\u201d YouTube ranks video",

Social media marketing tools can help you create content, schedule posts, engage with your audience, analyze performance, study competitors, keep up with trends, search influencers \u2026 phew! I could go on. Whether you\u2019re flying solo or working with a team, having a few good tools in your toolbox can save time and help you focus on what really matters: creating great content and connecting with your audience. The challenge isn\u2019t just stitching these tools together (though that\u2019s no easy feat either!): it\u2019s figuring out which ones are worth your time and budget. In this article, we\u2019ve rounded up 21 of the best social media marketing tools for various use cases to save you the trouble of researching. Some of the tools on this list will help you do multiple tasks, while others are more specialized. Whatever your strategy is, you can mix-and-match tools from this list to bring your social media marketing plan to life. Let\u2019s get into it. Jump to a tool: Buffer : Best for creators and small business owners Hootsuite : Best for combining social media management with social listening Sprout Social : Best for combining social media management with influencer marketing Verlynk : Best for combining social media management with social media monitoring Madgicx : Best for creating Meta ads Kitchn : Best for managing a social media advertising strategy Keyhole : Best for market research Siftsy : Best for analyzing comments on your posts Socialinsider : Best for a deep dive into your performance analytics Mention : Best for social listening YouScan : Best for image monitoring SparkToro : Best for audience insights Manychat : Best for DM automation Modash : Best for finding influencers Short.io : Best for shortening your URLs Repurpose.io : Best for repurposing your short-form videos Quuu : Best for content curation Canva : Best for editing your images CapCut : Best for editing your videos Rival IQ : Best for competitive analysis Supermeme.ai : Best for turning text into memes 1. Buffer Best social media marketing tool for creators and small business owners Free plan/trial available : Yes. Free forever for up to 3 channels. All paid plans also have a 14-day free trial. Price : Paid plans begin at $6/month/channel. Buffer is a social media management tool that can make many tasks on your to-do list easier. Some of my favorite core features: Schedule your social media posts across all major social media platforms Store your rough post ideas in a dedicated dashboard Create a customized landing page within minutes AI assistant to refine your social media captions Collaborate with your social media team Measure and analyze your performance Template library to spark content ideas As you can probably guess, Buffer alone is powerful and can take many tasks off your plate. However, the great part about Buffer is that it is both powerful and easy to use (one of the rarest combinations in the world of social media marketing tools, in my opinion). Buffer\u2019s also quick to add all the above functionalities for new social media platforms (hi there, Threads and Bluesky ) at whip speed. This means that Buffer can evolve as your strategy shifts \u2014 a big plus when you don\u2019t want the headache of adding another social media marketing tool for a new platform. Creators and social media managers often struggle with posting consistently because they have a lot to do besides social media management. This is why Buffer has habit-building features like streaks to keep you motivated. The tool also makes it easy to store ideas using the create space (my favorite feature), because inspiration can strike anywhere, anytime. \ud83d\ude80 Sign up for Buffer\u2019s free-forever plan \u2192 2. Hootsuite Best social media marketing tool for combining social media management with social listening Source Free plan/trial available : No free plans. All paid plans have a 30-day free trial. Price : Pricing starts at \u20ac149/user/month for five social media channels Like Buffer, Hootsuite is a social media management platform. This means you can use it to publish posts on multiple platforms, track performance, and respond to comments. But what makes it stand out is its social listening features. Since acquiring Talkwalker, Hootsuite has emerged as a top contender in the social media listening tools market. You can: Track brand mentions and stay on top of trends Never miss a piece of user-generated content Understand brand sentiment The tool\u2019s trademarked Blue Silk AI also condenses heaps of data and findings into a digestible format. And Hootsuite goes beyond social media platforms to also find what people are saying about your brand on other websites, forums, and podcasts. Beyond social listening, Hootsuite is more suitable for large and complex teams. It has numerous advanced features \u2014 so learning to use the tool is a complex process. Its price might also be a dealbreaker for many people. It might be a better idea to pair a dedicated social listening tool with an affordable social media management platform if Hootsuite\u2019s cost is out of your budget. 3. Sprout Social Best social media marketing tool for combining social media management with influencer marketing Source Free plan/trial available : No free plan available. All paid plans have a 30-day free trial. Price : Pricing starts at $199/seat/month, including five social media accounts. All plans require annual billing. Sprout Social is another all-in-one social media tool. It can help you manage your overall social media presence, helping you do tasks like: Publish posts across many social media channels Respond to comments and queries coming in via social media networks Understand your social media performance and pinpoint what\u2019s working (and what\u2019s not) Apart from these features, Sprout Social also offers a great influencer marketing tool, where you can find authentic and relevant creators using topic search. Let's say you want to find influencers who post about sustainable makeup products. You can input that phrase on Sprout Social\u2019s influencer marketing tool directly and discover creators who post on that subject. Then, you can analyze a creator\u2019s profile to ensure they match your brand values and requirements. You can even manage your influencer marketing campaigns right inside the tool (in addition to your other social media campaigns). If you\u2019re a social media marketer also managing influencer marketing for your company, Sprout Social can be a godsend \u2014 you can manage all your efforts in one software instead of scraping multiple tools together. What can hold you back is the cost. Sprout Social\u2019s influencer marketing tool comes at an additional cost (separate from the price of its social media marketing software). A silver lining: If you don\u2019t like Sprout Social as a social media tool, you can still use it as your influencer marketing software and pay for it separately. 4. Verlynk Best social media management tool for combining social media management with social media monitoring Source Free plan/trial available : Free plan allows you to connect up to 3 social media accounts (but not X). You can schedule up to 10 social media posts per channel at a time. All paid plans have a 14-day free trial. Price : Pricing starts at $9.99/month for 10 social media channels. Verlynk can assist you with a range of tasks. It can be your: social media scheduling tool engagement tool monitoring tool analytics tool But what makes Verlynk stand out is its unified social media inbox feature. You can respond to conversations across your social channels in one place \u2014 this includes DMs , comments, and mentions. I love that you can also filter your inbox based on social media channels, audience sentiment, message type, timeline, and conversation status. If you use social media for customer service, you can even create canned responses for frequently asked questions. And what if you use social media platforms to generate leads? In Verlynk, you can set up real-time alerts to ensure you never miss a message and reply promptly. Verlynk is ideal for a creator or social media marketer who relies heavily on social media to run their business \u2014 whether that\u2019s to generate leads or provide customer support. That said, Verlynk doesn\u2019t suffice as a social media monitoring tool if you get a large number of mentions, messages, or comments across multiple networks. In that case, you\u2019d be better off pairing a social media tool with a dedicated monitoring software. \u26a1 Looking to listen? Here's a list of the best social media monitoring tools . 5. Madgicx Best social media marketing tool for creating Meta ads Source Free plan/trial available : No free plan. All paid plans have a seven day free trial. Price : Pricing starts at $72/month and increases with your monthly ad spend. If you practice social media advertising on Facebook or Instagram , Madgicx can help you run, manage, and optimize your paid strategy. What about the Meta ads manager? The Madgicx dashboard is far more user-friendly and offers additional features. It goes beyond basic analytics and even allows you to create ads using AI. You can even scroll through the ad library and save ads you like within your industry for future inspiration. My favorite feature is the AI marketer, which analyzes your ads and suggests areas for improvement. This feature can come in handy \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a beginner or looking to experiment. Lastly, Madgcix has an add-on one click report tool that allows you to monitor ads not just on Meta, but also on Google Ads, TikTok, Google Analytics, Shopify, and Klaviyo \u2014 all in a single dashboard. It costs $29/month (early bird price). 6. Kitchn Best social media management tool for managing a social media advertising strategy Source Free plan/trial available : No free plans.

      "content_text": "At Buffer, security has always been a balance: keeping our customers\u2019 accounts safe while making login as seamless as possible for our global user base. A few months ago, we made a decision that might sound surprising \u2014 we removed SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and moved fully to email-based verification. It wasn\u2019t a change we took lightly. SMS has long been seen as the standard for 2FA. But over time, the drawbacks began to outweigh the benefits. Here\u2019s the story of how we got there, what the transition looked like, and what we\u2019ve seen since. Why we moved away from SMS SMS-based 2FA has long been considered a security standard, but our team discovered several critical issues that made us reconsider: Security vulnerabilities were more common than expected SIM swapping attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing attackers to hijack phone numbers and bypass SMS-based security. Additionally, SMS messages travel unencrypted through multiple carriers, creating potential interception points. Costs were scaling unsustainably Every authentication SMS costs money, and with our growing user base, these seemingly small fees were adding up to hundreds of dollars monthly. International SMS rates made this even more challenging because our global user base. International regulations and Sender ID requirements SMS regulations vary dramatically by country, making compliance a constant challenge. Each country has different requirements for Sender IDs (the name that appears as the sender of an SMS), with some requiring pre-registration that can take weeks or months to complete. For example, Singapore requires business verification documents, India demands a template pre-approval process, and the UAE has strict content restrictions. Managing these requirements across 100+ countries created an enormous administrative burden that grew with each new regulation. Additionally, failing to comply with any local regulation could result in messages being blocked, and ultimately customers being unable to log into Buffer. Third-party dependencies created failure points We relied on SMS gateway providers that occasionally experienced outages, delivery delays, or rate-limiting issues. When these services go down, our users can not access their accounts\u2014a critical problem for a tool that powers social media strategies worldwide. Why email made more sense When we looked for alternatives, we realized we already had a stronger option: email. So instead of just removing SMS and calling it a day, we reimagined our authentication flow by incorporating email as another venue. We implemented time-limited, single-use verification codes sent via email with enhanced security headers and encryption. Our email infrastructure, which we already maintained for notifications and updates, proved more reliable than third-party SMS gateways. We also added rate limiting and anomaly detection to prevent abuse. The unexpected benefits of switching to email The transition delivered improvements beyond our initial expectations: Security actually improved. Email accounts typically have more robust security options than phone numbers, including their own 2FA, recovery options, and activity monitoring. Users maintain better control over their email accounts than their phone numbers, which can be transferred without their knowledge. Support tickets decreased. We saw a drop in authentication-related support requests. Users no longer struggled with international SMS delivery issues, changed phone numbers, or carrier-specific problems. Development velocity increased. Our engineering team no longer needs to maintain integrations with the SMS provider, debug delivery issues across different carriers, or handle country-specific SMS regulations. How we rolled out the switch Making this transition required careful planning. We communicated the change to users well in advance, explaining the security benefits and addressing concerns. We provided detailed migration guides and temporarily supported both methods during the transition period. For users who strongly preferred SMS, we helped them understand that modern email security, especially with providers like Gmail or Outlook that offer robust protection, provides equal or better security than SMS. We also enhanced our email delivery infrastructure to ensure reliability, implementing redundant email service providers and monitoring delivery rates closely. The right choice for Buffer This decision won't be right for every company. Services that don't have users' email addresses or that serve demographics with limited email access might need different solutions. However, for Buffer \u2014 where every user already has an email account associated with their profile \u2014 this change aligned perfectly with our needs. Three months after the transition, the results speak for themselves: a reduction in authentication-related support tickets, and significant monthly savings that we've reinvested in product improvements. Looking ahead Removing SMS authentication initially felt like swimming against the current, but it forced us to think critically about security theater versus actual security. Sometimes the \"standard\" solution isn't the best solution for your specific context. We're continuing to explore additional authentication options, including support for hardware security keys. But our email-first approach has proven that simpler can indeed be more secure. We share these kinds of stories because we know other teams face similar tradeoffs. Have you reconsidered a \u201cstandard\u201d security practice recently? We\u2019d love to hear from you on our social media! Find us @buffer everywhere and follow Carlos on LinkedIn here .

      "content_text": "At Buffer, one of our core values is Focus on Self-Improvement . But a value on its own doesn\u2019t create action. Values need structure and support behind them. I\u2019m Suzanne, Buffer\u2019s Operations Manager. Part of my role is building and executing the systems that help turn our values into reality. In this article, I\u2019ll share how we support self-improvement at Buffer and how our teammates are tapping into those resources in their own ways. Let\u2019s take a look behind the scenes. Growth Mindset Fund Every teammate at Buffer has access to a $1,000 annual Growth Mindset Fund . The goal is to create a flexible way to encourage self-improvement and skill-building among the team. The name \u201cGrowth Mindset Fund\u201d comes from psychologist Carol Dweck\u2019s research on growth mindset. Dr. Dweck pioneered the idea that abilities aren\u2019t fixed and that learning and effort can lead to improvement over time. \u201cIn the fixed mindset, everything is about the outcome. If you fail\u2014or if you\u2019re not the best\u2014it\u2019s all been wasted. The growth mindset allows people to value what they\u2019re doing regardless of the outcome . They\u2019re tackling problems, charting new courses, working on important issues.\u201d\u00a0Carol Dweck writes in her book, Mindset. Here are just a few things our teammates have used their Growth Mindset Fund for: Courses to build or deepen a skill, specifically \u2935\ufe0f A course on coding with React An animation on the web course A self-paced workshop on testing accessibility One-on-one coaching or mentorship, specifically \u2935\ufe0f Design mentorship through MentorCruise Accounting coaching through Wyzant Executive coaching with Tiles Collab Memberships in professional communities, specifically \u2935\ufe0f Elena\u2019s Growth Scoop membership Skillshare membership CodeCrafters membership Productivity tools or software, specifically \u2935\ufe0f Blinkist ToDoist Recall Teammates have also financed conferences using the Growth Mindset and dedicated Conference funds, which I'll cover more in-depth in the next section. Conferences For some teammates, learning happens best in person by attending conferences, forming relationships, and hearing from others in the industry. Each year, we identify a small number of key conferences where Buffer would benefit from having teammates attend. While this list changes, here are a few conferences that we continue to find valuable year after year. WWDC Meta Connect API Days GraphQLConf Threads API Summit Buffer fully covers the cost of these, everything from registration to travel, to accommodation, and meals. We see these conferences as strategic investments for both the company and the teammate. Often, our team will even present at these conferences as we love building in public and sharing what we\u2019re learning transparently! Buffer\u2019s Staff Product Manager, Amanda M arochko , on the far left joined a panel at the 2024 Threads API Summit. If a teammate wants to attend a different conference not identified on our key conferences list, they can absolutely still do so! We would cover up to $1,000 of conference expenses through the use of their Growth Mindset Fund. For example, Senior Content Writer Tami Oladipo used her Growth Mindset Fund to go to SXSW London this year (you can read about everything she learned there in this article , if you\u2019re interested!). Unlimited books We also believe that reading can be a powerful way to learn and grow. Every teammate receives a free Kindle when they join Buffer and can expense any digital or audiobooks they choose. No approvals needed. No need to tie it directly to work. We believe that books of all kinds can expand our perspective and increase our creativity. That\u2019s why we believe in supporting everything from science fiction and romance to leadership books and marketing deep dives. Curious what we\u2019re reading? Check out buffer.com/books for a peek at our ever-evolving team bookshelf. Right team \ud83e\udd1d\u00a0Right support Learning looks different for everyone. Learning can even look different every year! Some teammates go deep on one new skill each year. Others dip into new topics month by month. Some prefer solo learning. Others thrive in community. We\u2019ve strived to build a structure that has the flexibility to support all of it. At the end of the day, no system works without the right people. That\u2019s why, when we\u2019re hiring for open roles at Buffer, we ask candidates to record a short video sharing something they\u2019ve learned recently. This is one of our favorite ways to spot lifelong learners who\u2019ll thrive here. Because while we\u2019ve built the tools and resources to support growth, it\u2019s our teammates\u2019 curiosity, drive, and love of learning that truly bring self-improvement to life. Over to you How do you like to learn best \u2014 books, courses, conferences, mentorship, something else entirely? I\u2019d love to hear. Drop a comment and share what\u2019s helped you grow recently.

      "title": "Does X Premium Really Boost Your Reach? An Analysis of 18M+ Posts",
      "url": "https://buffer.com/resources/x-premium-review/",

      "content_text": "X has been more open lately about how its algorithm works. In its own documentation, the platform notes that engagement is the strongest signal for visibility \u2014 replies, profile clicks, and dwell time top the list \u2014 but Premium subscribers also get an extra lift. In a recent breakdown from Social Media Today on the X algorithm, verified accounts (which come with a Premium subscription) benefit from this boost, alongside other factors like video watch time and conversation depth. On the flip side, link posts, all-caps updates, and \u201coffensive\u201d content see sharp penalties. In other words, X has made it clear: if you want reach, you need to be engaging and verified. This insight raises an important question: just how much difference does Premium actually make? To answer that, we teamed up with Buffer\u2019s data scientist, Julian Winternheimer, and looked at more than 18.8 million posts from 71,000 accounts over the past year. The results show a growing divide \u2014 Premium isn\u2019t just about editing tools or longer posts anymore. It\u2019s also about distribution. Does Premium really change content performance on X? Our analysis suggests that Premium accounts do see significantly more visibility. \ud83d\ude80 According to our findings, Premium accounts get around 10x more reach per post than regular accounts. Interestingly, reach has trended downward over time on X, with median reach going from hovering near 1000 in August 2024 to less than 750 in August 2025. \u26a1 Engagement rates show a similar pattern . Premium accounts moved from a median of about 0.3% in late 2024 to 0.4% by mid-2025. In contrast, regular accounts declined from around 0.15% to a median of 0% by March 2025. A median of zero means that at least half of these accounts received no likes, replies, or reposts on their posts. This aligns with what X has shared about its algorithm: Premium subscribers receive visibility boosts, while non-Premium accounts may find their content harder to surface. Our findings reflect that dynamic. Premium now appears to influence not just access to features, but also how content is distributed in the feed. The study: how Premium affects reach and engagement on X To understand just how much an X Premium subscription changes things, we analyzed 18.8 million posts from 71,000 X accounts between August 2024 and August 2025. Roughly 27% of these accounts were subscribed to one of X\u2019s three Premium tiers: Basic, Premium, or Premium+. When we compared reach and engagement side by side, a pattern emerged: performance isn\u2019t split only between free and paid accounts \u2014 there are also differences within Premium itself. That means X effectively functions as a tiered system, where visibility varies by subscription level. To illustrate what that looks like, we broke the data down across reach, engagement, and content type. In the next section, we\u2019ll walk through those differences in detail. \ud83d\udca1 If you\u2019re interested in seeing Julian\u2019s analysis, check out his blog for a deep dive . 1. What\u2019s the difference in reach between regular and Premium accounts? \ud83d\ude80 In our dataset, Premium users received around 10x the median reach of regular accounts. That gap has been consistent over the past year but became especially pronounced in 2025, when Premium+ accounts \u2014 the highest tier \u2014 began to pull further ahead. Regular accounts : typically under 100 impressions per post. Basic accounts : a small lift above non-subscribers, but still limited reach. Premium accounts : closer to 600 impressions per post. Premium+ accounts : often more than double Premium accounts, and the clear leader at over 1,550 impressions per post. While Premium users might have larger audiences, follower size alone doesn\u2019t account for the difference. The scale of the gap suggests that Premium tiers benefit from built-in distribution advantages, consistent with what X has outlined in its documentation. \ud83d\udca1 For creators and brands focused on reach, Premium appears to provide a stronger baseline for visibility. 2. What\u2019s the difference in engagement between regular and Premium accounts? When it comes to engagement (likes, replies, and reposts), the differences across tiers are less dramatic than for reach. Premium Basic leads slightly, with a median engagement rate of around 0.55% per post . Premium+ is close behind, landing right at 0.53%. Premium sits marginally lower, at around 0.49%. Regular accounts had a median engagement rate of 0% , meaning at least half of these accounts received no visible interaction on a typical post. Interestingly, Premium Basic appears to \u201cpunch above its weight\u201d on engagement, even without the broader visibility that comes with higher tiers. Still, without the same reach, those engagement gains may be less impactful overall. 3. Which X Premium tier is the best? Premium isn\u2019t a single upgrade \u2014 it comes in three tiers, and the differences show up in both features and performance. \ud83d\ude80 Premium+ subscribers consistently see the highest reach of all account types. Standard Premium users perform far better than regular accounts, while Premium Basic sits closer to an entry-level step-up. Taking a month-to-month look from mid-2024 to mid-2025, some interesting patterns emerge from the data: Premium+ : leads across both reach and engagement. In some months, their median reach doubled that of standard Premium. Premium : delivers the biggest jump compared to regular accounts \u2014 the line where the visibility gap truly opens. Basic : unlocked essential Premium features like longer posts and editing, but didn\u2019t show the same reach gains as the higher tiers. Engagement rates were relatively strong, though limited visibility meant those interactions didn\u2019t scale as widely. Regular accounts : remain at the bottom, with reach under 100 impressions and a median engagement rate of 0%. X Premium comes in three tiers with different features and visibility benefits. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what each tier offers. Tier Price Key Features Performance Impact (from our data) Best For Basic $3/month Includes essential Premium features like editing posts, longer posts (up to 25k characters), longer video uploads (3 hours/8GB), bold/italic text formatting , bookmark folders , create communities, custom app icons , and modest reply prioritization Little to no measurable reach/engagement lift compared to free accounts Users who mainly want basic features and small additional benefits without paying for full visibility Premium $8/month All Basic features + monetization ( ads revenue sharing , creator subscriptions ), Media Studio , X Pro, higher Grok access , reduced ads (about half), Premium gifting, and the verification checkmark Where the visibility gap truly opens \u2014 consistent reach/engagement advantage over Basic/free Creators and brands who want a subscription plan that offers both premium features and measurable distribution gains Premium+ $40/month All Premium features + ad-free browsing, long-form Articles, highest Grok access , Radar trend tracking, top-tier reply prioritization , and visibility boosts The strongest performance \u2014 often doubling the reach of other Premium tiers Power users and brands relying on X as a core growth platform, where a premium subscription provides maximum increased exposure \ud83d\udc49 In short : Higher X Premium tiers correlate with stronger visibility. 4. Which content performs best on X? Not all post types are created equal \u2014 and the data makes that crystal clear. When we broke engagement rates down by content type, the gap between Premium and regular accounts became even sharper. Some takeaways from the dataset: Text posts : Consistently lead for Premium accounts, climbing close to 0.9% median engagement by mid-2025. For regular accounts, engagement collapsed to ~0.25% after March 2025. Video posts : A close second, holding steady above 0.7% for Premium users while dropping sharply for non-subscribers. Image posts : Reliable but middling \u2014 Premium users see around 0.4\u20130.5% , while regular accounts hover closer to 0.2%. Links : The weakest format across the board. Premium cushions the blow (around 0.25\u20130.3%), but for regular accounts, engagement flatlined to 0% in March 2025. \ud83d\udca1 If you\u2019re paying for Premium, lean into text and video. They deliver the strongest, most reliable engagement lift. Images can diversify your feed, but links remain heavily penalized unless you\u2019re on a Premium plan. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more about what to post on X: Data Shows Best Content Format on Social Platforms in 2025: Millions of Posts Analyzed 5. Do posts with links affect content performance? Yes, but not all posts are affected equally, and Premium softens the outcome. \ud83d\udea8 For regular accounts, link posts have been completely suppressed since March 2025 \u2014 their median engagement rate is 0%. That means if you\u2019re not on X Premium, sharing a blog post, product page, or newsletter link is essentially invisible. For Premium users, links still underperform compared to text, video, or images \u2014 but they at least register meaningful engagement, typically around 0.25\u20130.3%. X\u2019s latest algorithm update makes this explicit: links trigger penalties. For non-Premium accounts, that means silence. For Premium accounts, links register, but lag far behind text and video. \ud83d\udca1 However, if you must share links, Premium+ is the safest bet for maintaining visibility. What this means for creators and brands Our data points to a clear pattern: Premium accounts receive more visibility, while non-Premium accounts often struggle to surface in the feed. That said, more reach doesn\u2019t always translate into better outcomes \u2014 the impact depends on your goals and how central X is to your overall strategy. \ud83d\udc49 Put simply: Premium can expand your distribution, but engagement remains the key factor in sustaining growth. If visibility on X is important to you, Premium may provide a stronger baseline \u2014 but the real driver is whether your posts spark replies and hold attention.

      "content_text": "One of the first hires we made at Buffer was for our customer support team, and that was intentional. We've always wanted every person who reaches out to feel genuinely valued and heard, striving to set the bar for exceptional customer support. That commitment to excellence in customer support hasn't changed in the nearly 15 years we've been in business. Over the years, we've built a team where everyone takes ownership of the customer experience and actively seeks new ways to deliver stand-out experiences. Buffer\u2019s customer support team includes 18 talented teammates from seven countries, and the average tenure for our team is nine years. Through thoughtful planning with our four-day work week, we maintain 24/7 coverage for our customers, and this balance reflects our commitment to both our team and our customers. \u27a1\ufe0f We\u2019re currently hiring for a new Customer Advocate to join our team. Learn more and apply here Read on to learn more about how we approach customer support and how we work together. Customer advocacy metrics on buffer.com/metrics Our approach to customer support: The Hospitality Mindset \u201cWe believe in the remarkable power of giving people more than they expect.\u201d - Will Guidara A key piece of Buffer\u2019s Customer Advocacy team is our hospitality mindset. We adopted this mindset to level up the support experience and to provide clarity to our why, how, and what. A hospitality approach in customer support means that we strive to create standout, above-and-beyond, and personal experiences in every customer conversation. While many of our support conversations stem from customer friction or frustration, we believe we can still deliver an encounter that leaves a lasting impression. Our goal is to be the company that we would want to go to for customer support if we needed something. To keep this approach top of mind, we start by being curious and intentional in every customer conversation. This mindset also means that we look for ways to personalise and connect during each interaction. We\u2019re working toward having fewer conversations about user friction and bugs by prioritizing product quality even more than usual right now. Our goal is to one day have more conversations with customers who reach out because they want to connect with us, whether to learn how to get the most out of Buffer, explore social media strategies, or share their successes and challenges. We always love solving problems for our customers, but the connections are what make our work meaningful. We draw a lot of inspiration from The Frictionless Organi z ation , a book written by Bill Price and David Jaffe. \ud83d\udc99 Read more about our hospitality mindset Our guiding principles For each customer interaction we have with customers, we also have three guiding principles: Awareness (I understand and see you): \u00a0Taking the time to really see the customer enables us to look between the lines for areas of frustration, opportunities to empower customers further, or doorways to build a deeper relationship. Clarity (I want to make sure you understand me): Our communication is our only medium to show our personality and ensure our customer is looked after. We provide the clearest path toward a resolution possible, focusing on how we can make it simple for customers to get to an answer. Empowerment (I can help you): We aim to be experts, not only as customer service professionals but also as experts at our product and how customers can successfully use it. We go above and beyond to find information for customers, and we're neither afraid to ask for help nor lean on each other to provide an above-and-beyond experience. Buffer's Customer Advocacy team on our 2025 team retreat What it\u2019s like to work on Buffer\u2019s Customer Advocacy team Each company approaches customer support differently; here\u2019s what we do at Buffer. A team built on trust, ownership, and flexibility What makes our culture truly special is the foundation of high trust, high ownership, and flexibility. Our team feels a high level of ownership of the customer experience at Buffer and have a deep understanding of their own impact as a support team member. We trust our teammates to create meaningful connections with every person they interact with. Most importantly, we trust each other to follow our instincts and make decisions that put our customers first. While we have a comprehensive internal FAQ and Wiki, we encourage our team to do what\u2019s right for the customer. This model means everyone has significant autonomy in how they manage their work and relationships with customers. This level of ownership over the customer experience is rare and transformative. We recognize that ownership and decision-making skills come easier with experience, and that's not something we take for granted. We work closely as a team to support each other with questions, gut checks, and \"second pair of eyes.\" This happens across Slack, Zoom calls, and even in notes in HelpScout. As team members build up a deeper understanding of our product, our customers, and our culture, their confidence and independence naturally grow. When someone is newer on the team, they tend to ask for more advice, which we welcome and encourage. Rather than having rigid processes in place, we lean heavily into trusting our team and the collaborative support approach we have in place. This foundation of trust we place in each other comes through in the service that we provide. It\u2019s a joy to do the right thing by customers and that is something that I genuinely believe folks notice. How we operate without complex hierarchies Our team operates without escalation processes or complex hierarchies. We work alongside each other in the Advocacy team and with other teams to deliver the best possible experience. By increasing communication and collaboration, we believe we can improve both the support and product experience. We aim to be exceptional We have three pillars that are the foundation of how we work and the experience we want to deliver: Exceptionally Fast Exceptionally Personal Exceptionally Informed These pillars guide our work as a team and help us with goal setting, both as a team and as individuals. Working remotely and creating a collaborative culture Our team spans multiple time zones, and this has created something quite special: we've learned that distance doesn't have to mean disconnection. We've built systems for seamless collaboration that feel more like having teammates right next to you than working across continents. An \u2018open office\u2019 approach Slack serves as our virtual office, but it's far more than just a messaging platform. It's where team members pop in to say, \"Has anyone else seen this come up?\" or \"I'm working on this tricky conversation \u2014 any thoughts?\" Think of it as that open office environment where you can tap someone on the shoulder or call out a question to the room, knowing someone will be there to help. We're intentional about chatting transparently and openly about any conversations or support issues we're struggling to solve. There's something powerful about this vulnerability \u2014 when someone admits they're stuck or unsure, it creates space for the entire team to learn together. We've found that the conversations we struggle with individually often become the ones that teach us the most collectively. Open communication isn't just how we solve problems; it's how we all get better at what we do. Team members know they can reach out for help the moment they hit a roadblock, and there's never any judgment \u2014 just genuine eagerness to figure it out together. Whether someone needs help understanding a technical issue or wants to brainstorm the best way to respond to a frustrated customer, team support is always there. Collaborating closely across Buffer Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. Rather than working in silos, we partner closely with teams across Buffer to identify friction points, enhance the customer experience, and deliver exceptional support. This cross-functional approach fuels continuous growth, both individually and collectively, which directly translates into better experiences for the people we serve. Our team regularly collaborates with Product, Engineering, Design, and other departments, ensuring customer insights flow naturally through every decision we make. This connection helps the entire company stay grounded in real customer needs. \ud83d\udcc6 Read about how we serve our customers while working four days a week A few members of our Customer Advocacy team at our 2025 team retreat How our Customer Advocates grow at Buffer We believe that customer support is both vital to our business and a fulfilling career choice for team members who genuinely care about helping folks and love solving problems. In our Customer Advocacy team, everyone interacts with customers regardless of their level or role. We focus on creating delightful customer experiences, both by supporting the successful adoption of our product and by digging into bugs and UX issues that need attention. As the team that connects most with our customers, we have an immense impact on our business. We've built our team around the idea that customer support professionals can both grow and specialize within this area. All team members need a broad foundation in our customer support fundamentals, but from there, they can choose their own growth path. Some remain generalists who excel across many areas, while others develop deep expertise in specialisations like AI, our Help Center, customer education, billing, technical troubleshooting, product development, and internal documentation. Within our team, individual contributors (meaning teammates who aren\u2019t managers) have a career framework to provide clarity of what growth looks like to support furthering their careers and developing their skills. It is important for us that there are growth opportunities beyond the traditional management track. The framework shouldn't limit anyone to one path",

      "content_text": "Everyone talks about how different social media platforms are, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. X is treated as the town square. Threads wants to be the friendly alternative. Bluesky champions decentralization and user control. But when we analyzed 1.7 million posts, a surprising pattern emerged: posts on X, Threads, and Bluesky get the same median engagement. In other words, whether you posted on X, Threads, or Bluesky, the median engagement lands at exactly four interactions. At first glance, this might make these platforms seem more alike than we\u2019d expect. But a closer look tells a different story. Beyond that baseline, their engagement dynamics diverge dramatically, revealing hidden patterns about virality, consistency, and audience behavior. The engagement patterns we\u2019ve uncovered don\u2019t just highlight platform differences \u2014 they show why a one-size-fits-all approach won\u2019t work in 2025. Our data scientist analyzed posts from 56,000 users to uncover these trends, and what we found changes the way we should think about social media strategy in 2025 \u2014 especially if you\u2019re deciding where to post and what to expect from each platform. Understanding the data Before we dive into engagement trends, let\u2019s break down what we\u2019re actually measuring and how we made sure these comparisons are fair. This analysis covers 1.7 million posts from 56,000 users across X, Threads, and Bluesky in early 2025. That\u2019s a lot of data \u2014 but as with any social media study, context matters. What we\u2019re measuring In this analysis, engagements refer to the total number of interactions a post receives \u2014 likes, comments, reposts, all of it. We chose this metric because it\u2019s the only one that can be directly compared across all three platforms. Now, if you\u2019ve read our previous analysis comparing engagement rates on X and Threads, you might notice what looks like a contradiction. That study suggested that Threads posts tend to have higher engagement rates, while this analysis suggests that, on average, X posts receive just as many engagements as Threads posts. Both findings are true \u2014 because they\u2019re measuring different things. Engagement rate measures how many people who see a post interact with it . Total engagements count all interactions, regardless of how many people saw the post . Neither metric is inherently better \u2014 it just depends on what you\u2019re looking to measure. If you\u2019re focused on how likely a post is to engage its audience, engagement rate matters more. If you care about how much total interaction a platform generates, total engagements tell a clearer story. This is a good reminder that platform comparisons depend on your perspective and that a single number rarely captures the full picture. What\u2019s ultimately important to remember is that social media engagement data is inherently skewed, and some people will get more engagement than others regardless of the network they post to. We used a mixed-effects regression model in this analysis to control for those factors. How engagement patterns differ across X, Threads, and Bluesky Throughout 2024, the typical post on all three platforms performed the same way: Half of all posts on X, Threads, and Bluesky received four or fewer engagements. At first glance, this suggests that engagement levels are nearly identical across platforms. But looking a little closer, this isn\u2019t always the case. For example, in February 2025: Threads increased to a median of 5 engagements X remained at 4 Bluesky dropped to 3 These shifts may seem small, but they indicate that each platform is developing distinct identities and that external factors are always shifting, affecting how they perform. How engagement scales on each platform Looking at the median engagement tells us how a typical post performs, but it doesn\u2019t capture what happens when posts take off. The large gap between median and average engagement means some posts go viral, pulling the averages up. This is similar to salary distributions, where a few high earners inflate the average, even though most people make much less. The average (baseline) number of engagements shows a dramatically different picture: X : 328 average engagements Threads : 58 average engagements Bluesky : 21 average engagements The key point that explains these differences is that the variance in the number of engagements is much, much higher on X than on Threads and Bluesky. Engagements on X have a standard deviation of over 5,000, meaning there is a very wide spread in engagement. The median is lower than the average because the distribution of engagement is skewed towards 0. What is a standard deviation, and why does it matter? A platform\u2019s spread (or standard deviation) tells us how far posts can climb beyond the baseline. A larger spread means any given post to the platform has higher viral potential, while a smaller spread means that posts get more predictable engagement. Basically, the three platforms are on a spectrum from Wild Virality \u2192 Predictability. Here\u2019s what we discovered about the different spreads on each platform. X is high risk, high reward X has the widest engagement spread, with posts deviating by 5,159 engagements from the baseline. Most posts still receive four engagements or fewer, but when a post takes off, it can go viral in the extreme. This makes X the best platform for viral reach , even though posting there means you run the 'risk' of modest engagement. The massive spread potential on X means that when a post breaks out, it can go viral in a way that\u2019s nearly impossible elsewhere. Here\u2019s how to play to X\u2019s strengths: Post consistently. Since virality is unpredictable, regular posting increases your chances of landing a breakout post. Experiment with highly shareable content. Memes, hot takes, and news-driven posts thrive on X\u2019s fast-moving algorithm. Expect inconsistency. Most posts will get little engagement, but the potential payoff is high. Threads offers consistent and predictable growth Threads has a moderate spread, with posts deviating by 628 engagements from the baseline. Its bump to a 5-engagement median suggests that engagement is stabilizing at a higher level. Unlike X, where virality is unpredictable, Threads r ewards creators who post regularly with steadier audience growth than any other platform . To succeed on Threads: Focus on conversation-driven content. Posts that encourage replies and discussion tend to perform better than one-way broadcasts. Build a community. Unlike X, where virality is the goal, Threads supports more long-term, engaged followers. Bluesky offers niche but reliable engagement Bluesky has the smallest spread, with posts deviating by 279 engagements from the baseline. While its median engagement has dropped to 3, the lower spread means engagement is more predictable. Growth on Bluesky is slower but steadier, making it better suited for niche, community-driven content rather than viral reach. Here\u2019s how to approach Bluesky: Create for a specific audience. Bluesky isn\u2019t about mass engagement \u2014 it\u2019s about focused, community-driven content. Expect steady but slow growth. Engagement is more predictable than on X but less explosive. Use it for deeper conversations. Thoughtful, discussion-heavy posts perform better than viral-style content. Do you need a cross-platform strategy? The recent divergence in median engagement and engagement spread on X, Threads, and Bluesky tells us something important: These platforms are no longer interchangeable. Each platform now offers unique advantages depending on your goals. You can choose to focus all of your efforts on growing one social network, or you can work on a multi-channel strategy. If you go with the multi-channel approach, remember to tailor your strategy to each platform. You can still use strategies like cross-posting across platforms; we'd recommend you do so thoughtfully. To cross-post smarter in 2025: Customize for platform strengths. With a few tweaks, the same post might go viral on X, get steady engagement on Threads, and spark discussion on Bluesky. Adjust captions, formatting, or tone accordingly. Use scheduling tools to stay efficient. Posting manually across platforms is unsustainable. Use Buffer to note your ideas, draft your posts, and edit them for each platform, then post everywhere without extra work. Analyze your own engagement trends. While these patterns are platform-wide, your audience might engage differently. Use data from your own posts to refine your strategy. Most of all, stay flexible. Platforms and the trends that they create change fast. The key is adapting to how engagement evolves over time. \ud83d\udca1 Check out Crossposting 101: Everything You Need to Know to Crosspost on Social Media Effectively Want more data? \ud83d\udcda Threads\u00a0Drives 73.6% More Engagement Than X \u2014 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know \ud83d\udcda Data\u00a0Shows Instagram Reels are Best For Reach \u2014 But Not Engagement \ud83d\udcda From Instagram to Bluesky: How Social Media Use Has Evolved Since 2022 Tamilore Oladipo Content Writer @ Buffer Read more posts by Tamilore Oladipo Try Buffer for free 180,000+ creators, small businesses, and marketers use Buffer to grow their audiences every month.

The platform is quietly becoming a powerhouse for creators and brands \u2014 and the numbers back it up. Buffer\u2019s analysis of millions of channel connections from 2022 to 2024 shows Pinterest engagement jumped from 3.08% to 5.26% and overall usage increased by 113%. That\u2019s serious growth you don\u2019t want to ignore. The great thing about Pinterest is that it works more like a visual search engine than a traditional social platform.

One well-placed pin can keep driving traffic for months, giving you long-term reach without you having to be online 24/7. Staying consistent on Pinterest doesn\u2019t have to take over your entire calendar.

Verify your website Claiming your website on Pinterest unlocks extra features (like seeing how often your content is shared) and makes it easier for people to discover more of what you do. It also helps people know where to find more information, since your Pinterest profile is linked to any pins with saved content from your website. 2. Brand your profile for discovery Your profile is the first thing people see, so make it count. Use a clear photo (your logo or a friendly headshot), add keywords to your name and bio, and choose a cover image that reflects your brand to set the stage before your scheduled pins take the spotlight. [call out] If you want to get more followers on Pinterest, here are 20 practical tips you can start using today. 3. Organize content into SEO-friendly boards Naming your boards with searchable keywords (\u201cQuick and Healthy Weeknight Dinners\u201d vs. \u201cYum Yum Eats\u201d) helps your scheduled pins show up in search. Keep boards active by pinning regularly \u2014 even if you\u2019re scheduling in bulk, you\u2019ll want each board to look alive and worth a follow. 4. Batch, repurpose, and schedule ahead The ideal posting frequency for Pinterest is at least once a week. But to gain followers faster, you can post 15\u201325 pins a day . That might sound like a lot, but the key is working smarter, not harder. Savvy Pinterest creators batch-create pins, repurpose content across platforms, and use scheduling tools to spread out posts. For example, one recipe video can turn into still shots, text-overlay pins, and even short clips \u2014 giving you weeks\u2019 worth of content from a single idea. Pro tip: With the Buffer browser extension installed, you\u2019ll also be able to find great content on Pinterest and queue up a new pin to share later. 5. Connect to Instagram Don\u2019t think you can\u2019t repost your Instagram content or TikTok videos on Pinterest \u2014 you absolutely can. Pinterest has made this even easier by auto-publishing to Instagram . When you connect your Instagram and Pinterest accounts, any content you post on Instagram will be automatically posted as a pin on your Pinterest profile.

      "content_text": "Most social media networks want to draw users onto the platform and keep them there. But, once again, Bluesky is taking the path less travelled. The decentralized social platform loves subverting the norm, and their latest announcement is the perfect example. Bluesky is testing a new livestreaming feature , starting with a small group of accounts and a few high-profile partners. While livestreams won\u2019t be hosted on Bluesky , users will be able to discover when someone is live \u2014 and jump directly to YouTube, Twitch, or another platform to watch. As Blueskky COO Rose Wang explains: \u201cWe aren\u2019t trapping you in Bluesky. We want you to use Bluesky to discover what\u2019s happening.\u201d Sounds pretty neat, right? Here\u2019s what we know so far. A new \u2018Live Now\u2019 badge is rolling out When a creator or brand in the test group adds a livestream link to their profile, Bluesky will display a red border around their profile picture and a 'Live' callout just below. Click the profile pic, and you\u2019ll be taken straight to their live content \u2014 whether that\u2019s a game, a news stream, or a Q&A on Twitch. \u201cBluesky is the place for breaking news and real-time updates,\u201d the company shared on its official account. \u201cThis tool supports streamers, journalists, and anyone sharing live moments as they happen.\u201d This focus on discovery , rather than keeping users within the app, is a notable departure from platforms like X, which historically preferred to host content natively. How Bluesky\u2019s Live Now badges work (so far) Here\u2019s a quick summary of how the test feature functions: Creators add a livestream link (YouTube, Twitch, etc.) to their post or profile A Live Now badge appears in the feed and around their profile picture Users who click through are taken directly to the livestream, off-platform This feature is not yet available to everyone, but Bluesky has confirmed plans to expand it It\u2019s a limited test \u2014 for now Bluesky says only a \u201chandful of accounts\u201d can currently access this feature, but the company is being transparent about the early-stage nature of the rollout: \u201cThis is an early test,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe\u2019re announcing this publicly so you know what we\u2019re working on, even though the feature is not widely available yet. We\u2019ll refine this feature based on feedback before a full launch to all users.\u201d So far, US basketball leagues, NBA and WNBA, are confirmed testing partners \u2014 both accounts now feature the new live indicators when promoting games. What does this mean for creators? The new livestream functionality lines up with the new platform\u2019s push to support creators\u2019 routes to monetization, even if that requires their users to leave Bluesky. The creator economy is \u201cbeautiful,\u201d Rose Wang shared in an episode of Buffer Chat: The Podcast , in late 2024 \u2014 and Bluesky has big plans for them. Rose gave the example of a stand-up comedian who would want to share a link to their live show with their social media audience. \u201cAs soon as you post the link for your stand-up show, what we\u2019re seeing is that people are getting de-promoted,\u201d she said. \u201cSo their posts that are funny and get 1,000 likes \u2014 because it helps people stay on the platform \u2014 then when they try to ask folks to leave to go to see a show, they get 60 likes. They\u2019re like, something\u2019s wrong, right?\u201d \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the promise of Bluesky,\u201d Rose said. \u201cYou get to own that relationship with your audience. There\u2019s no de-promoting links on Bluesky.\u201d With the new live badge feature, the hypothetical comedian will not only get to share a post that\u2019s not downranked \u2014 their live show will be spotlighted in theirhis follower\u2019s' feeds. On Buffer Chat, Rose also shared how Bluesky is thinking about native routes to monetization for creators. The plan is to build a system where creators can get paid right on Bluesky and any other platforms built on their open AT Protocol ecosystem. \u201cAnd then we'll increase the volume of those transactions, and the creators and folks take home most of it, and we just take a percentage of the transaction fee,\u201d Rose says. \u201cAs they make more money, we should make money \u2014 but if they aren\u2019t, we shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d That said, Rose shared that due to the complicated nature of payment systems, monetization probably won\u2019t be coming to Bluesky for a while. \u201cIt takes time \u2014 payments just take a while. But absolutely, it\u2019s one of the things that we are prioritizing.\u201d What\u2019s next for livestream badges? While there\u2019s no firm timeline for a full rollout, Bluesky\u2019s team says they\u2019ll be gathering feedback from this first test phase and refining the feature as they go. If you spot a red-ringed profile on your feed with a \u2018 Live Now\u2019 badge, now you know what it means \u2014 and where it\u2019ll take you. Watch this space for more.

      "content_text": "Ever since Meta officially launched Threads, there has been a lot of speculation about which approach to content gets the best results. So, instead of just speculating, I decided to put some extra time and effort into posting to Threads consistently for a month. Now, what does it say about me (or Threads) that my top-performing posts from the last 30 days were: A \u201cWhat\u2019s in my bag?\u201d inspired by another post A reply to someone about how we create Human User Guides at Buffer? I\u2019m genuinely interested in your thoughts, so let me know in the comments! But that\u2019s just one fascinating part of one month of consistent posting, and not what I expected when I set out to see what would happen if I committed to posting consistently on Threads. Like many creators, I\u2019ve been curious about this platform's potential and how it could fit into my personal content strategy. The results were surprising \u2014 some wins, some misses, and a few unexpected insights I\u2019ll carry into my future social media planning. Let\u2019s dive into the good, the challenging, and the lessons learned during my 30-day Threads experiment. Why I chose to do this experiment on Threads When Meta launched Threads , it immediately sparked my interest. While video-first platforms like Instagram and TikTok have dominated the social media landscape, Threads offered something refreshing: a place to engage in real, conflict-free conversations from a company with a historical focus on visual content. As someone who thrives in community building and meaningful interaction, I saw an opportunity \u2013 and Threads seemed like the perfect place to test new approaches. The simplicity and conversational focus of the app were appealing, and it was the perfect ground to experiment with a different type of social engagement. Keeping it simple and consistent The rules were straightforward: I would post consistently for 30 days from August 12 to September 12, aiming to engage with the community by sharing thoughts, asking questions, and responding to others. There wasn\u2019t a specific niche I was focusing on \u2014 the goal was to test if consistency alone could generate growth and valuable interactions. Along the way, I kept track of my activity, prioritizing a mix of text-based content, questions, and commentary on trends or personal experiences. I also made sure to track my content with tags in Buffer . Of course, this challenge isn\u2019t perfect. For one, I didn\u2019t have any particular posting schedule prior to the 30 days of the experiment, so I have nothing to compare my performance to. Additionally, Threads doesn\u2019t yet have robust analytics, so I\u2019m taking a theoretical approach to analyzing the results from this project. However, I still think there are valuable lessons to be learned from this project, so let\u2019s get into it. What I posted to Threads As I stated, I hadn\u2019t been particularly active with posting to Threads before this experiment, but my announcement of my #30ThreadDays project received the most comments of anything shared before or after. Post by @tamioladipo View on Threads My content strategy mostly consisted of posting \u201clifestyle\u201d content with a sprinkling of content centered around my professional and side projects. I went this route because this type of content fills my feed and is what I enjoy consuming. Tami Oladipo (@tamioladipo) on Threads In honor of 30ThreadDays, I wanted to introduce myself: \ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f Content writer by day @buffer \ud83d\udcad Eldest thought daughter by night\n\ud83d\udccd Lagos, Nigeria\n\ud83d\udcf1 Social media & creator economy sun, remote work & productivity moon, fashion & lifestyle rising\n\ud83e\udee1 When that one girl said \u201cname a hobby outside of media consumption\u201d, I faltered \u2013 ask me about TV/movies/music/anime etc. Threads Also, since my Threads account wasn\u2019t established prior to this experiment, and I wasn\u2019t sure how much visibility my content would get, I stuck with safe, easy-to-execute formats. A breakdown of the metrics Between native Insights, a new Threads feature rolled out during the period of the experiment, Buffer\u2019s post analytics, and this officially approved analytics platform , I was able to estimate the performance of my content. Overall, my post views and engagement fluctuated over the 30 days, seemingly at the whims of the Threads algorithm . However, as I engaged more with others and made sure to respond promptly to replies, I noticed that consistent posting started to build small but noticeable momentum. The most eye-popping metric is views \u2013 my content got 13,793 views. These are the number of eyeballs on my content, a significant jump (over 850 percent) from the previous 30-day period. Some other interesting metrics include: 233 likes (+1356 percent from the last period) 37 replies (+311 percent) 9 reposts (+800 percent) 2 quotes (+100 percent) My follower count also grew, going from 267 to 290 in 30 days \u2013 not a significant jump, but not the worst outcome. While the engagement isn\u2019t the most impressive, it\u2019s also not the focus of Threads \u2013 replies and comments are. In that regard, I can say that I definitely saw more of those. What worked (and what didn\u2019t) The first few days of the experiment were a whirlwind. I wasn\u2019t an active Threads user before, so I wasn\u2019t sure how much visibility my content would get. However, my announcement post for the #30ThreadDays project did surprisingly well, generating significant engagement, as did the following post. As I continued posting, my visibility varied. Some days, my posts barely gained traction, while other days, I noticed a spike in engagement. While mildly frustrating, this fluctuation gave me some key insights into how the platform works and how its audience interacts with content. Open-ended questions outperform any other type of content A recent experiment found that questions generate more reach than any other type of content on Threads. Specifically, posts that invited conversation or shared an open-ended thought performed better than static updates or reposts from other platforms. However, I\u2019ll take that a step further and share that, in my experience, posts that were comments on or replies to questions did the best. For example, a simple reply to someone about how we create Human User Guides at Buffer generated my second-highest engagement rate. Post by @tamioladipo View on Threads Interestingly, quoting a post to share my reply didn\u2019t really do any better or show up any differently for me. But replies did much better. Post by @tamioladipo View on Threads We can assume that\u2019s because adding onto a post that already has traction is a surefire way to get the engagement ball rolling. This discovery is nothing new \u2013 other users of Threads  on the Buffer team have found a lot of success jumping into the comments . \ud83d\udca1 Takeaway : Threads thrives on interaction, and posts that spark conversation are much more effective than static content. Timeliness sparks engagement Another win was timely commentary. Whenever I commented on a trend or hot topic, I saw a noticeable boost in replies and profile views. However, this isn\u2019t restricted to just what\u2019s in the news. My top-performing post from the 30-day duration of this experiment was me replicating a format I had seen and liked, then tagging the original creator. Post by @tamioladipo View on Threads This was a clear sign that being part of the conversation in real-time mattered. \ud83d\udca1 Takeaway: Jumping into relevant conversations and sharing thoughts on trending topics is a great way to increase visibility on Threads. I also learned that engagement begets more engagement. Responding promptly to comments on my posts helped keep the conversation going and boosted my visibility even further. The more you put into Threads, the more you get out of it. \ud83d\udca1 Takeaway: Quick, thoughtful responses to comments can amplify your post\u2019s reach and build stronger community ties. Prioritize visual content \u2013 but not video Threads says it\u2019s a text platform, but it showed its Instagram roots in its prioritization of engaging graphic content \u2013 a sentiment shared by other Threads users at Buffer. My amateur-ish Canva graphics consistently outperformed text posts \u2013 but interestingly, videos didn\u2019t do any worse or better than text. Post by @tamioladipo View on Threads I don\u2019t know if it was me or my approach, but none of the video content I posted did particularly well. That doesn\u2019t mean video doesn\u2019t work at all \u2013 it just didn\u2019t work for me. So, until the Threads team explicitly states that they\u2019re prioritizing video, save your creative energy for fun graphics and insightful questions. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more about how to grow on Threads What didn\u2019t work so well However, not everything was smooth sailing. A few lessons stood out: Niche-less posting didn\u2019t resonate : When I posted without a clear direction or focus (like a job posting in the middle of my lifestyle content), engagement was inconsistent. Threads seems to thrive on niches, even if they are broad, so the lack of a specific focus for my content meant it didn\u2019t always hit the mark. Lesson learned: Consistency is important, but having a focused niche makes a bigger impact. Too much repurposed content : While cross-posting can be a time-saver, I noticed that content directly brought over from other platforms didn\u2019t perform as well as original, platform-specific posts. Threads has its own vibe, and I\u2019ll be focusing more on content tailored to the platform moving forward. Lesson learned: Threads has its own vibe \u2014 content tailored for the platform will always perform better than repurposed material. My final lesson might just be conjecture, but I wanted to share anyway. Don\u2019t be the first reply in your thread. For a platform called Threads, I noticed a pattern of posts that had follow-ups performing poorly. So, keep your text post to the main box and if you must, add a visual with more text. Moving forward with Threads After 30 days of consistent posting on Threads, the biggest takeaway is that community and conversation are at the heart of this platform. Unlike Ins",

Facebook marketing refers to using Facebook\u2019s tools (like Facebook business pages, ads, groups, and reels) to build your brand, connect with your audience, make some sales, grow your following, or whatever it is that you want to achieve. For creators, small business owners, and marketers, Facebook marketing is all about showing up consistently, building trust, and reminding folks why they followed you in the first place. Think of it as your digital storefront, community board, and word-of-mouth network, all rolled into one scrollable feed. The top 5 benefits of Facebook marketing With billions of active users and powerful tools to help you reach exactly the right people, Facebook is still one of the best places to grow your brand online. Let\u2019s break down the top five reasons why Facebook marketing deserves a spot in your strategy. 1. Massive and diverse reach With over 3 billion monthly active Facebook users , the social media giant remains the most-used globally (as an active user, I feel pretty validated by my choice of social media platform right now). The ability to get in front of such a vast audience offers incredible opportunities to connect with new customers across various demographics. Whether your audience is local or global, cat lovers or coffee snobs, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re on the scroll right now. 2. Get your content in front of the right eyes Facebook\u2019s targeting tools are like matchmaking for marketers, helping your posts reach people who will actually care. You can filter by interests, behaviors, location, and even life events. Basically, it\u2019s less shouting into the void and more speaking directly to your people. 3. Multiple content formats to tell your story From long-form social media posts and photo carousels to videos, stories, and reels, Facebook lets you tell your story your way. Whatever your vibe and your goal, there\u2019s a format that fits. \ud83d\udca1 You can learn more about the different post types in this section: What to post on Facebook: the main content types . 4. Built-in community and engagement tools Facebook makes it easier to show up, connect, and build your own little corner of the internet with tools like: Facebook Groups Messenger Comments Events Live video Polls and questions Reactions and replies Personally, Facebook is my go-to for finding local events in my area. So much so that my friends who aren\u2019t on Facebook come to me to ask about the latest happenings. (To any skeptics out there: I\u2019ll make a Facebook fan of you yet.) Yay, I have a Mother\u2019s Day Sip & Sketch coming up: 5. Actionable insights and Facebook analytics I know that numbers aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s thing (even me). But when they show you what\u2019s working (and what\u2019s flopping), they\u2019re worth a second look. Facebook\u2019s analytics help you track reach, clicks, engagement, and more, giving you the data to help refine your Facebook marketing strategy over time. In my Facebook Group, Freelancers Who Work Smart, Not Hard , I can see that my views are up, but my engagement (posts and comments) is down. This tells me that the group is attracting more people, but perhaps not the right people. Or, it\u2019s attracting the right people, but they\u2019re not getting enough value to engage (I confess, it may be the latter). So, what can I do? I need to focus on providing real value for my target audience so that they don\u2019t just click and leave. I hope these pointers got you fired up about Facebook. That said, as a creator or small business, you still need to be selective about which social media platforms you use. You don\u2019t want to risk burning out by trying to be everywhere all the time. Is Facebook marketing right for your business or brand? Short answer: If your audience is on Facebook, you can be successful on the platform. Longer answer: If you only have time to focus on one or two social media platforms as a creator or small business marketer, you want to make sure that you\u2019re choosing the right ones. Here\u2019s how to find out if Facebook makes sense for your brand: Ask your audience The easiest way to find out if Facebook is a good place to reach your audience is to ask them. If you have an email list, send a brief survey asking about their social media habits. Ask which platforms they use most often and where they like to follow brands. No email list? No problem. Just be a human being and chat whenever you have a chance, whether that\u2019s at the checkout in your physical store, on your other social platforms, or next time you meet with them. Compare your target audience to Facebook users Different audiences are more active on certain social media platforms than others. You can compare the demographic (gender, age, geographical location, income, etc.) and psychographic traits (interests, values, beliefs, and personality) of your target audience with the social media platforms you\u2019re considering. Look at your competitors If businesses like yours are racking up likes and sparking conversations in the comments on Facebook, chances are your people are hanging out there, too. If your competitors aren\u2019t on Facebook, it might be a sign it\u2019s not where your audience spends time\u2026 or it might be your chance to stand out. If people have told you they\u2019d follow you there, you could be ahead of the curve, ready to claim a little space before anyone else does. Case in point: Buffer \ud83d\udc4b. We have a Facebook page, but use it sparingly. We\u2019re a small team, so it makes more sense for us to focus on platforms that our customers and community use frequently (right now, that\u2019s LinkedIn, Instagram, Threads, and Bluesky). Getting started: How to set up your Facebook account There are two ways to get set up on Facebook \u2013 as a creator or as a business. Here\u2019s how: How to set up Facebook as a creator Whether you\u2019re sharing your art, your expertise, or your side projects, Facebook can help you build an audience that actually sees your work. Here\u2019s how to get started: 1. Choose between a Facebook business page and professional mode For a Facebook creator, both a Facebook Page and professional mode on your profile offer ways to build a public presence and potentially monetize your content. What\u2019s the difference? A Facebook Page is a separate entity for public figures, businesses, or brands. Professional mode transforms your existing personal profile into a creator-focused presence, while still keeping your personal connections separate. You can access creator tools and monetization features from within your profile. According to Facebook for Creators , Facebook Pages offer more advanced tools and features, while professional mode provides a streamlined experience for creators. How do you choose? If you want a separate public presence , a Facebook business page is the better choice, as it allows you to create a professional identity separate from your personal profile. If you want to use your existing profile for your creator journey , professional mode is a good option, as it lets you build a public presence and maintain your personal account and network in the same place. Cash\u00e9 switched to professional mode recently: \u201cIf I\u2019m preaching connection and authenticity for my clients, I\u2019ve got to walk the talk too, right? This is the perfect way to let people see behind the polished \u2014 or let\u2019s be honest, overthought \u2014 content.\u201d \u201cProfessional mode lets me test content themes, track what actually lands, and stay visible to the right audience without juggling multiple pages,\u201d she says. \u201cFacebook\u2019s professional mode made it easier to automate my organic growth. It gave me reach beyond what a regular personal page could do \u2014 like auto-invites and growth prompts,\u201d says Aiza Coronado , a lifecycle strategist, writer, and co-founder. You can create both a business page and your own professional profile, but it will take some extra work to keep both active and updated, and you\u2019ll end up diluting your audience, so it\u2019s probably a better idea to choose one. This is what a professional profile looks like: same as a regular profile, but with the Follow button: \ud83d\udca1 Choosing a Facebook business page? Read the instructions for how to set up Facebook as a business or brand . Going for professional mode? The next steps show you how to set it up. 2. Go to your Facebook profile : Head to your profile on the Facebook app or website. 3. Tap the three dots: You\u2019ll see them near the top right of your profile. (Note: you\u2019ll need to make sure that your profile is unlocked.) 4. Select \"Turn on professional mode\": Scroll down and choose the \"Turn on professional mode\" option. 5.

      "content_text": "One of the most common questions creators ask or get asked: \u201cIs my engagement rate good?\u201d The truth is, it depends on how many followers you have. A 5% engagement rate means something very different for an account with 500 followers compared to one with half a million. That\u2019s why we analyzed more than 27 million Instagram posts from 273,000 accounts to see how engagement rates shift as creators grow. The result is a clear picture of what \u201cgood\u201d looks like at every stage \u2014 from less than 1,000 followers all the way up to 1 million or more. In this article, we\u2019ll break down the average engagement rate by follower tier and share what the numbers actually mean in practice. \u26a1If you want to explore more metrics like reach, posting frequency, and growth rate, check out our Instagram benchmarks page . \ud83d\udd22 The average Instagram engagement rate Before we get into follower tiers, here\u2019s what the average account looks like on Instagram today. These numbers give you a quick benchmark for the \u201ctypical\u201d account. Median engagement rate: 4.3% Average posting frequency: 17 posts per month (~4 posts per week) Average follower growth rate: 3.3% per month Median reach per post: 242 From here, the real insight comes from seeing how those averages shift depending on follower size. \ud83e\uddee Learn how we calculate engagement rates in What is Engagement Rate? \ud83e\ude9c Tier-by-tier breakdown of engagement rates Here are the engagement rates to expect at each follower tier on Instagram from nano to mega accounts. 0 to 1K followers: Build the habit of consistency Engagement rate: 5.2% Posting frequency: 13 posts per month or ~3 posts per week Growth rate: 5.1% per month Median reach per post: 33 Engagement rates are high at this stage because the people following you are likely friends, peers, or early supporters. But the real unlock isn\u2019t in the numbers \u2014 it\u2019s in creating a rhythm that sets you up for sustainable growth. So if you\u2019re just starting out, your focus should be less on community management and more on building the discipline to post regularly. Our research has found that more posts equal more growth. Specifically, posting between 3 and 5 times weekly can more than double follower growth rate , compared to posting one or two times weekly. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Focus on building the habit of posting. Pick a manageable cadence (around three posts per week is the average here) and treat it as practice. Use this stage to experiment with formats, captions, and ideas without the pressure of performance. \ud83d\udcd6\u00a0Learn more about the impact of posting frequency on your growth in How Often Should You Post on Instagram in 2025? What Data From 2 Million Posts Tells Us 1k to 5K followers: Start scaling consistency Engagement rate: 4.6% Posting frequency: 16 posts per month or ~4 posts per week Growth rate: 2.5% per month Median reach per post: 185 Once you\u2019ve built the habit of posting, this stage is about scaling that consistency. You\u2019re starting to reach beyond your immediate circle, and a drop in engagement rate is natural as your audience diversifies. What matters most here is showing up often enough for new followers to recognize and remember you. One of the major gains at this follower tier is that the more you post, the more reach you\u2019ll receive on each post. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Aim for around four posts a week (the average in this tier) and start paying closer attention to what formats or topics spark the most reach. Small optimizations at this stage compound quickly into steady growth. 5k to 10K followers: Optimize your content mix Engagement rate: 4.1% Posting frequency: 20 posts per month or ~5 posts per week Growth rate: 2.6% per month Median reach per post: 507 At this stage, you\u2019ve moved past the early-experiment phase and into real momentum. Engagement rates dip slightly, but your reach is climbing \u2014 each post now lands in front of hundreds of people. Consistency is expected, but what separates steady growth from real traction is what you post. Reels get the most reach on Instagram, pulling in 39% more reach than carousels and a huge 122% more than single-image posts. Meanwhile, carousels get the most engagement, earning 12% more engagement than reels and 114% more than single-image posts. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Identify which formats (Reels, carousels, single-image posts, Stories) drive the most engagement and reach, then lean into them. Keep testing, but start making strategic choices about where to double down so your time and effort scale with your audience. \ud83d\udcd6\u00a0Learn more about which Instagram formats perform best in Data Shows Instagram Reels are Best For Reach \u2014 But Not Engagement 10k to 50K followers: Double down on what works Engagement rate: 3.7% Posting frequency: 23 posts per month or ~5\u20136 posts per week Growth rate: 2.3% per month Median reach per post: 1,073 By this point, you\u2019ve found some traction \u2014 certain content types or themes are consistent hits with your audience. Engagement rates are still above the Instagram median, and your reach has crossed into the thousands per post. The challenge here is less about figuring out what works and more about doing more of it with intention. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Look back at the posts that have driven the most engagement and reach, then systematize how you create and share them. Build repeatable formats (like recurring series , templates , or hooks ) so you can maintain momentum without reinventing the wheel every week. 50k to 100K followers: Increase volume strategically Engagement rate: 3.6% Posting frequency: 31 posts per month or ~1 post per day Growth rate: 1.7% per month Median reach per post: 3,090 At this level, your account has momentum, but sustaining growth requires more output. The average posting frequency here jumps to daily \u2014 showing that creators with larger audiences stay top of mind with their audiences by showing up consistently. Engagement rates at this tier hold steady, and reach continues to rise into the thousands. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Moving toward daily posting can help you stay competitive, but it doesn\u2019t mean you should sacrifice quality. Repurpose your strongest formats, experiment with variations, and think in terms of series or themes that keep your audience coming back without burning you out. 100k to 500K followers: Build systems for scale Engagement rate: 3.5% Posting frequency: 47 posts per month or ~1\u20132 posts per day Growth rate: 2.2% per month Median reach per post: 7,127 At this stage, reach starts to scale dramatically. Your average post is landing in front of more than 7,000 people. But with higher visibility comes the demand for a steady stream of content. Many creators in this tier are posting more than once a day, and the ones who grow sustainably tend to have workflows, templates, or even small teams in place to keep the engine running. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Batch create content, repurpose top performers across formats, and consider enlisting help (editors, designers, or collaborators) to maintain both consistency and quality. The focus shifts from just creating to managing a repeatable process. 500K to 1M followers: Expand reach intentionally Engagement rate: 3.7% Posting frequency: 101 posts per month or ~3+ posts per day Growth rate: 1.5% per month Median reach per post: 37,400 Once you\u2019re here, every post has massive reach \u2014 tens of thousands of people on average. And engagement holds steady, but the scale means each like or comment represents thousands of interactions. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Amplify what you\u2019re already doing with partnerships, collaborations, and cross-promotion. Experiment with trends strategically \u2014 not chasing every one, but leaning into those that align with your niche. 1M+ followers: Protect and nurture engagement Engagement rate: 5% Posting frequency: 98 posts per month or ~3 posts per day Growth rate: 0.8% per month Median reach per post: 107,224 Crossing the million-follower mark comes with a paradox. Growth slows to less than 1% per month, but your baseline audience is massive. Each post reaches over 100,000 people on average, and interestingly, engagement rates tick back up to around 5 percent. The challenge shifts from growing fast to maintaining quality, connection, and trust at scale. \ud83d\udfe2 Do this: Prioritize content that builds loyalty rather than chasing vanity metrics. Use stories, lives, and comments to stay accessible, and treat collaborations or sponsored content with care \u2014 the more you maintain trust, the longer your influence lasts. Why engagement rates change as accounts grow Engagement isn\u2019t static. As accounts grow, the way followers interact with content changes. Smaller accounts often see higher engagement rates because their audiences are tight-knit. People know the creator personally or feel more directly connected. A like or a comment feels natural in those smaller communities. However, as follower counts climb, engagement rates typically dip. Instead of a 5% engagement rate on a few hundred followers, larger accounts might see 3% to 4%. But that \u201csmaller\u201d percentage could still equal tens of thousands of interactions per post. So don\u2019t compare your engagement rate to someone in a completely different tier. The real insight comes from seeing how your account stacks up against others of a similar size. That\u2019s where the benchmarks become most useful \u2014 and why we\u2019ve broken the data down tier by tier. What these benchmarks mean for you The data makes one thing clear: Instagram growth isn\u2019t linear. Engagement rates dip and rise, posting frequency ramps up, and follower growth slows as audiences get bigger. But across every tier, there\u2019s a consistent theme \u2014 the creators who keep showing up are the ones who keep moving forward. What \u201cgood\u201d looks like depends on your size. For smaller accounts , it\u2019s about building the habit of consistency. For mid-sized creators , it\u2019s refining your content mix and doubling down on what works. And at the higher tiers , growth is less about chasing numbers and more about maintaining systems, reach, and trust at scale. If you take away only one thi",

      "content_text": "If you\u2019ve been seeing Buffer teammates pop up on your social feeds a lot more lately, it\u2019s not a coincidence. It\u2019s by design! We\u2019ve been intentionally investing in building a team of Buffer creators as a company-wide initiative. At the core of this work is a simple belief: being creators ourselves will continue to set Buffer up for long-term success. By living the same creator journey as our customers, we can make better product decisions and connect more meaningfully with the people we serve. Becoming a team of creators is a signature brand bet that we've kicked off in 2025; it\u2019s our way of building Buffer from the inside out. In this post, I\u2019ll take you behind the scenes of how we\u2019re making it happen. From the systems and workshops we\u2019ve designed to support our teammates, to the early signals of impact we\u2019re already seeing. The evolution from dogfooding to Team of Creators Buffer\u2019s story with creation started long before we called it \u201cTeam of Creators.\u201d Back in November 2010, our CEO Founder Joel Gascoigne built the first version of Buffer during a Startup Sprint to solve a problem he was experiencing: he wanted a way to space out when his tweets were sent. In the early days, we were small, the product was personal, and many teammates were building in public \u2014 tweeting often and using Buffer just as our customers did. Creation was woven into the day-to-day in a natural way, but there was no formal structure and no shared expectation. As Buffer grew, our approach became more intentional through dogfooding \u2014 using Buffer internally to publish our own content, test new features, and catch bugs before they reached customers. Dogfooding kept us close to the product and gave us useful feedback loops, but it had its limits. We were using the product, but not necessarily living the customer journey. The shift to building a team of creators Team of Creators is a deliberate shift from dogfooding, and a defensible long-term strategy that could be a huge differentiator for Buffer. We\u2019re no longer just testing our product internally; we\u2019re creating content in public together. That means experiencing the same hesitations, creative blocks, and cold-start challenges our customers face; and learning how to move through them. In the process, we\u2019re building our own voices and consistency; and gaining a deeper understanding of what it takes to grow as creators which ultimately helps us create a better product experience. Team of Creators is about encouraging every Bufferoo to share their voice in a way that feels natural to them; on social platforms they\u2019re most comfortable with, and in areas they genuinely care about. That might mean a designer sharing their process on Instagram , a marketer offering industry tips on LinkedIn , or a teammate posting their hiking adventures on Threads . It\u2019s not about only posting about Buffer, it\u2019s about building the habit of creating and connecting consistently. Joel talked about this shift from dogfooding during our June 2025 All Hands, reflecting on how Team of Creators marks a natural evolution in our culture: one that moves beyond transparency into visibility, and invites every teammate to be a storyteller in their own way. An overview slide from Buffer's June All Hands highlighting our four strategic themes. Setting expectations at Buffer This shift has been intentional, and is a change we're making company-wide. We've had certain teams in the past that naturally worked on becoming creators, but this change is company-wide \u2014 every role, every team. To truly make the vision for our team of creators be a reality, Joel , set a clear expectation that everyone on the Buffer team participates and starts their creator journey; with managers supporting this work along the way. A slide from Buffer\u2019s June All Hands presentation, outlining how teammates should think about their role in Team of Creators. We\u2019re not just empowering the entire Buffer team to grow their voices on social, build public credibility, and share real stories from behind the scenes. We\u2019re setting a high standard of excellence. This shift strengthens our culture, builds a stronger bridge to our community, and creates a form of brand differentiation that\u2019s hard to replicate. As Michael Porter writes in What is Strategy? : \u201cA company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can preserve.\u201d Team of Creators is how we preserve that difference; by keeping our people at the center, and learning by doing. Once we\u2019d made the decision to become a true team of creators, the real work began. How we built the Team of Creators ecosystem It\u2019s one thing to set an expectation, it\u2019s another to build a program that people want to be part of, week after week, for the long haul. Even great ideas can lose steam once the initial excitement fades. For Team of Creators to deliver on its promise, we couldn\u2019t just rely on initial enthusiasm; we needed to build something that would make it easy, energizing, and rewarding for teammates to take part over the long term. That meant creating a strong backbone: clear structure, accessible resources, and ways for teammates to support and inspire one another. With that end goal in mind, we set out to create a framework that could stand on its own, adapt over time, and truly help Bufferoos build a sustainable habit loop. That also meant making intentional choices about what to prioritize first, and setting up systems we could scale as momentum grew. Setting up support systems for Buffer creators Step one was making sure every teammate had practical support, clear pathways, and a place to connect with others doing the same. That foundation came together in several interlocking parts, starting with a dedicated Slack channel. The Slack channel: #buffer-creators Slack was the natural choice for this first step since it\u2019s where we already collaborate daily , and we wanted this space to mirror the community spirit we\u2019ve built externally, but within Buffer. From the very beginning, we kept the comms pace intentional and set the channel up as an active, working space to swap ideas, share wins, ask for feedback, and cheer each other on. A peek into the #buffer-creators slack channel on Buffer's Slack. One key piece of the strategy was to keep focus on a human and values-led approach, rather than kicking off any system-based automations or zaps in Slack on day one. Some days that meant asking what content people were planning for the week; other days it was spotting a teammate\u2019s post in the wild; grabbing a screenshot, and sharing it with the link so others could boost it. And always, there were taco emojis \u2014 our Slack tradition for celebrating wins, living our values, and marking milestones! An example of giving Buffer teammates shoutouts on the #buffer-creators Slack channel. We also made it a point to spotlight teammates who were just starting out as creators or were slightly more introverted. The aim was twofold: encouragement and visibility. Established Buffer creators \u2014 those with existing audiences and more creator experience \u2014 often joined in, offering platform-specific tips, sharing AI workflows, or breaking down viral post frameworks . A #buffer-creators Slack post from Simon, Director of Growth Marketing, sharing an automated workflow for LinkedIn posts using RSS, Notion, OpenAI, and Buffer. Over time, a set of natural champions emerged: people who consistently offered encouragement, tips, and quick help for anyone navigating the creator journey . This deliberate early nurturing really paid off. Today, #buffer-creators is a buzzing nook of experiments, candid conversations, and mutual support. Teammates openly share post drafts, ask for feedback, and celebrate Buffer Streaks from our leaderboard. Many posts have gone from draft to published in a matter of minutes, given the collaborative review process. It\u2019s also become a chance to learn from each other, as teammates watch how different people shape their ideas and bring content to life. \u2b91 Checkout what Suzanne (Finance) posted from the above Slack thread, on LinkedIn !\ud83c\udfc6 As the space evolved a bit more, we added one light-touch automation \u2014 a Monday check-in \u2014 to keep the momentum going. Automated Monday check-in notification in the #buffer-creators Slack channel. It\u2019s a gentle accountability mechanism that also sparks idea sharing and sets the tone for the week. But the heartbeat of the channel remains the same: Real people supporting each other, as they grow as creators. The #buffer-creators Slack channel. Team of Creators Resources HQ (Notion) The next big step was level-setting creator knowledge with rich and easy-to-follow resources. We did not want to assume people knew where to start. We wanted to create something that felt like a light, choose-your-own-path onboarding: easy to dip into, substantial enough to level up. That became the Team of Creators Resources HQ in Notion; a working library for kickstarting or up-leveling a creator journey . A peek at Buffer's Team of Creators Resources HQ on Notion. Inside, teammates could find: Clear context for why the initiative exists, why it matters, and simple first steps to get going. Actionable guidance on identifying a niche , picking a primary platform, and setting achievable content goals. Practical techniques for content batching and scheduling content with Buffer. Exercises and strategies for reframing common creator mindset hurdles. Platform-by-platform best practices, plus notes on how algorithms tend to behave. Repurposing playbooks to help content travel further. Tools for packaging content well, aligned to personal brand goals. Since teammates are balancing this journey with day-to-day work, in a 4-day work week ; we were careful to avoid information overload. Throughout the hub, the tone stays warm and precise; pages are short and interactive. We baked in prompts like \"Identify your why with these questions\" so people could define their purpose at their own pace. We also la",

      "content_text": "For years, creators have shared the same warning: \u201cDon\u2019t post links \u2014 they\u2019ll harm your reach.\u201d But numbers to back it up have been hard to come by. That\u2019s what we set out to test, this time on X, formerly known as Twitter. With the help of our data scientist Julian Winternheimer, we dug into 18.8 million posts from 71,000 X accounts , and the results are clear: links really do hurt performance. For creators and brands who rely on sharing links as part of their content strategy, the data points to something bigger than a small algorithm tweak. Let\u2019s get into the numbers. \ud83d\udca1 If you\u2019re interested in seeing Julian\u2019s analysis, check out his blog for a deep dive . Do posts with links affect content performance on X? The short answer: yes \u2014 and the impact is dramatic. Our analysis shows that posts with links perform significantly worse than other content types. As of August 2025, Link posts had 0% engagement rate on regular accounts ~0.28% engagement rate on Premium accounts Image posts had ~0.20% engagement rate on regular accounts ~0.42% engagement rate on Premium accounts Video posts had ~0.25% engagement rate on regular accounts ~0.85% engagement rate on Premium accounts Text posts had ~0.40% engagement rate on regular accounts ~0.90% engagement rate on Premium accounts The graph shows how, even with reduced reach for regular accounts, every format holds some engagement except links , which fall to absolute zero after March 2025. This does seem to confirm the idea that the X algorithm downranks content with links. However, Premium accounts continue to see reach and engagement on link posts \u2014 though even there, links underperform compared to text, images, and video. When we dug into the best content to post on X in March (before the drop), links were the lowest-performing format on X. However, they weren\u2019t at absolute zero, so the sharp drop post-March puts into perspective just how much has changed on the platform since then. Premium users, on the other hand, can still drive engagement with links \u2014 though even there, native formats consistently outperform. What stands out most is the scale of the divide: Premium accounts now see around 10x the reach of regular ones. That creates a compounding cycle: more reach \u2192 more followers \u2192 even greater reach. And not all Premium is equal. Premium Plus subscribers get the highest reach of all account types, with mid-tier and Basic Premium still far ahead of regular users. This advantage suggests the difference isn\u2019t just about larger audiences \u2014 it\u2019s built into how X distributes content. \u26a1Learn more about the impact of X Premium on content performance in Does X Premium Really Boost Your Reach? An Analysis of 18M+ Posts . Spoiler: It does! Why is there such a sharp divide? The most likely explanation is platform incentives . X has a strong reason to keep users on-platform instead of sending them elsewhere, and it also has a clear motivation to encourage more users to pay for Premium. Together, those incentives mean link posts \u2014 especially from non-paying accounts \u2014 get pushed down in distribution. The result is a two-tier system: Regular accounts : link posts are effectively invisible. Premium accounts : links are still viable, but carry lower engagement than other formats. This points to a fundamental change in how X rewards content \u2014 and a clear message to creators and brands who depend on sharing links. Implications and workarounds for link posts on X For creators and brands, the message from X is clear: link posts are no longer a reliable way to reach your audience unless you\u2019re in the Premium tier. If you\u2019re running a regular account, external links won\u2019t just underperform \u2014 they may not perform at all. Since March 2025, link posts from non-Premium accounts have been effectively invisible, with median engagement rates stuck at zero. That means newsletters, product pages, and blog posts shared directly in the timeline won\u2019t drive the results they used to. So what can you do? Invest in Premium if links matter to you. Premium accounts still generate reach and engagement on link posts, though less than on other formats. If driving traffic is a core part of your strategy, upgrading may now be part of the cost of reaching your audience.. Use native formats first, links second. For both Premium and regular users, content that stays on-platform \u2014 threads, images, video \u2014 consistently performs better. Use these to deliver your main message, and treat the link as supplemental. Put links in replies instead of the post. While not foolproof, this approach can sometimes avoid the distribution penalty. The key is to make the main post engaging enough to earn attention before introducing the link. Diversify beyond links. If you\u2019re sharing articles, consider turning key insights into a short thread. Promoting a product? Pair it with an image or video demo. Think of the link as a bonus, not the centerpiece. The bottom line: on X, links are now the weakest format you can publish \u2014 especially without Premium. Building a sustainable strategy means leaning on formats the platform favors and using links more sparingly and strategically.

      "content_text": "So many factors contribute to the success of your videos on YouTube: your video title, thumbnail, YouTube SEO , and (most importantly) the quality of your content. It\u2019s a lot to consider, and it\u2019s often not easy to pinpoint what will resonate with your YouTube subscribers the most. But thanks to our analysis of more than 1 million videos shared on YouTube, we can offer a little more concrete guidance on at least one of those factors: the best time to post on YouTube . As we\u2019ll get into later on, this is not a magic bullet for content success \u2014 the factors I mentioned above have an outsized impact. But compared to all the work that goes into the rest of these processes, posting your YouTube videos and YouTube shorts when you\u2019re most likely to get views is an easy box to tick. And it could give your content the boost it deserves. In our analysis, we compared the median views of more than a million videos shared at different times. This helped us pinpoint patterns in the posting times with the highest video views, which we recommend as the best time to post on YouTube. Of course, these are general recommendations \u2014 in this article, I'll also walk you through how to figure out the best time to post on YouTube for your audience, whether you\u2019re a marketer, casual content creator, or full-time YouTuber. Jump to a section: The best time to post on YouTube The best time to post on YouTube daily at a glance The best and worst days to post on YouTube The best time to post YouTube Shorts Finding the best time for you to post YouTube videos and Shorts The best time to post on YouTube The best time to post on YouTube overall is Wednesday at 4 p.m . \u2014 we found that videos shared at that time tended to get the highest number of views. Other posting times that got high views are Thursday at 4 p.m. and Monday at 4 p.m. \ud83c\udf1e Generally speaking, videos shared between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays tended to get the most views. In the heatmap graph above, the darkest slots represent the time slots with the highest video views (the best time to post on YouTube) while the lighter blocks are the time slots with the lowest video views (the upload times probably best avoided). You\u2019ll see that audience behavior is pretty predictable, given that most YouTube users are working age \u2014 more than 40% of YouTube users are between the ages of 25 and 44 , per Statista. These peak hours suggest that most YouTube users prefer to watch videos later in the day as their workday draws to a close, when they have time to watch longer videos. Views on videos posted earlier in the mornings tend to be lower, though views start to climb during midmornings, lunch breaks, and late afternoon and evening. The worst times to post on YouTube are generally between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. , when most viewers are asleep. That said, there still are some good times to post videos on YouTube on the other days of the week that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Here\u2019s a closer look at the best time to post on YouTube for each day of the week. \ud83c\udf0d Wait, what time zone? To make this data easier to understand, our data scientist Bufferoo has done some mathematical magic to make the recommended time zones universally applicable. In other words, no need to convert. Whether you're in EST (Eastern Standard Time), PST (Pacific Standard Time), or IST (Indian Standard Time), the times apply to you. At a glance: The best time to post on YouTube On most days of the week, anywhere between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. is a great time to post on YouTube.

The best time to post on YouTube on Thursday The best time to post on YouTube on Thursday is 4 p.m. , followed by (you guessed it) 3 p.m., and 5 p.m., respectively. Videos uploaded on Thursdays at 4 p.m. saw the second-highest median views of the week, making it a great slot for your YouTube posting schedule. The best time to post on YouTube on Friday The best time to post on YouTube on Friday is between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. The time slot with the highest views was 3 p.m., with other peak slots at 4 p.m., then 5 p.m. The best time to post on YouTube on Saturday The best time to post YouTube videos on Saturday is in the late afternoon, at 5 p.m ., then 3 p.m., then 4 p.m. That said, Saturday is a slower day on the platform, so, if you can, it might be best to keep Saturday off your posting schedule. The best time to post on YouTube on Sunday The best time to post on YouTube on Sunday is in line with the rest of the week: 3 p.m. is the best slot , with other peak hours at 4 p.m., then 5 p.m. However, Sunday is the worst day of the week to post on YouTube \u2014 our analysis showed that videos shared on Sundays tended to get lower views than the rest of the week. The best and worst days to post on YouTube The best days of the week to post on YouTube are Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. According to our data, those three posting days are tied for median video views. For best results, publish YouTube videos between 3 and 5 p.m. on these days. Sunday is the worst day of the week to post YouTube videos, followed by Saturday. Videos posted on weekends tend to get lower views than the rest of the week, so it could be worthwhile experimenting with a weekday-only posting schedule. \ud83c\udf0f Just as there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all best time to post, there\u2019s no single best time to post across all social platforms, either. Here\u2019s the best time to post on Instagram , the best time to post on TikTok , the best time to post on Facebook , and the best time to post on LinkedIn . The best time to post YouTube Shorts The best time to post YouTube Shorts is Wednesday at 4 p.m., with 4 p.m. on Thursday and 4 p.m. on Monday coming a close second and third, respectively. Our dataset weighed the median views of all YouTube videos, including YouTube Shorts, so the graphs and data in this article apply to both long-form videos and YouTube Shorts. So, you can safely post YouTube Shorts during the time slots mentioned above, too. \u26a1 Give your YouTube Shorts the best possible chance of success by scheduling them to go live at peak viewing times with Buffer. Sign up (for free!) here \u27a1\ufe0f Finding your best time to post on YouTube As we often share on this blog, every audience is different. Videos with the most views are generally uploaded in the timeslots above \u2014\u00a0but they may not be the right fit for your audience and their behavior. So, your best time to post on YouTube might be slightly different to what we've shared here. Your YouTube posting schedule, like all things in content marketing , has to be finetuned and figured out for your specific audience. But how do you do that? The good news is that YouTube Analytics makes this pretty easy. Their metrics are extensive and updated in real-time. Here, you\u2019ll get a good sense of when to post videos for your target audience \u2014 if you know where to look. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide. 1. Go to YouTube Studio First up, head over to YouTube Studio. While there are several routes via your YouTube channel when logged in, it\u2019s easiest to head straight to studio.youtube.com . If you\u2019re just starting, it\u2019s worth familiarizing yourself with the tool (here\u2019s how to use YouTube Studio for newbies). In a nutshell, YouTube Studio is your channel's control room, where you\u2019ll go to upload your videos and shorts, keep on top of your subscribers and comments, manage monetization, and monitor your video performance. 2. Check out your YouTube analytics Of all the native social media analytics tools , YouTube Studio is one of the best. Not only does it offer you a wealth of stats and numbers, but it also does an excellent job of helping you understand and take action from all those metrics. To access all this good stuff, click on the Analytics tab on the left-hand side of your screen. Here, you\u2019ll find your YouTube analytics Overview , with insights into your overall viewership, watch time, subscriber growth, engagement metrics, and more. Visiting this space should be a regular task on your social media marketing checklist. 3. Navigate to \u2018Audience\u2019 This is where things get interesting. In YouTube Studio\u2019s Audience tab (at the top of the screen), you can dig into some fascinating info about your audience as a whole \u2014\u00a0not just your subscribers. You\u2019ll find insights into things like which videos are growing your audience (definitely a set of metrics to pay attention to if your goal is to grow your YouTube channel), a host of audience demographics like location, age, and gender, as well as the type of content your audience usually watches on YouTube (YouTube Shorts, Lives, or longer videos). But when it comes to the best time to post on YouTube for you , the most helpful analytics segment is\u00a0' When your viewers are on YouTube .' To find this graph, scroll down a bit on th",

      "content_text": "Landing paid partnerships as a creator doesn\u2019t necessarily require a huge following \u2014 but it does require a professional influencer media kit. Many brands and companies are happy to work with creators and influencers with smaller followings, but they\u2019ll likely want to see some proof of your metrics and professionalism before sending you a contract or products. Enter: a media kit. Media kits are essential for social media influencers looking to monetize their work, no matter their audience size, says Ayomi Samaraweera , former TikTok employee turned creator, now the founder of Canopy , an online community for creators. Ayomi would know \u2014 she landed her first deal with only 2,000 TikTok followers. \u201cIt\u2019s the industry standard for a professional creator to have a media kit readily available \u2014 it makes it a lot easier for the brand to quickly review the creator and understand their content, rates, engagement stats, and do a reference check if they include brand testimonials in the media kit.\u201d \u201cIt saves a lot of back-and-forth emailing if you're able to share a media kit early on in the conversation. It helps you show your value with data, highlight past work experience, and make a good first impression on a brand.\u201d There are many influencer media kit templates you can use to simplify things, but there are drawbacks to just copy-pasting your numbers into a Canva template. For one thing, it\u2019s likely influencer marketing teams have come across the more popular free templates already (and a quick copy-paste job is not the best way to make a good first impression). You need your media kit to be accurate, professional, and most importantly, unique \u2014 just like your content. I spoke to content creators and influencer marketing team leaders to get their best advice for creating media kits that stand out. Let\u2019s dig in and help you land your dream social media collaboration . Whether you\u2019re a full-time content creator, micro-influencer, nano-influencer, or just getting started, here\u2019s how to create your own media kit. What is an influencer media kit? A media kit (also called a press kit or collaborations kit) is a document or website creators or influencers will send to brands they\u2019re looking to partner with on their social platforms . It\u2019s usually a brief, well-designed kit that includes details about the creator, number of followers and engagement metrics, their audience demographics, the type of content they create, and examples of past campaigns. How to create an influencer media kit Let\u2019s start with a quick checklist \u2014 gather all this information before you even begin to think about the design of your media kit. Influencer media kit checklist Here\u2019s an overview of what to include in your media kit: Key metrics from your main social media platforms Audience demographics Social media links An \u2018about me\u2019 section Testimonials from past brand collaborations Relevant content examples Contact details Here\u2019s a closer look at all of the above: Key metrics from your main social media platforms Include things like follower count, engagement rate, and click-through rate for all social media accounts. Bloggers will want to include website pageviews as well. \u201cBrands often make decisions based on data,\u201d Ayomi says. \u201cYou want to keep the data high-level and visual, so if the brand just skim reads it, they can quickly pick up the key information \u2014 the more data-driven, the better. A good question to answer here is: \u201cDoes this creator's target audience trust them?\u201d Ryan Prior , Head of Marketing at Modash (a platform marketers can use to track influencer marketing campaigns), says. \u201cEngagement rate is a good start. Average views, too. Comment quality is another strong indicator. Consider showing examples of highly engaged conversations and things like DMs and Story replies that a brand might not see otherwise,\u201d he adds. Audience demographics Think gender, location, age, and more \u2014 whatever you have access to. \u201cThese are insights I always look out for to ensure we have strong brand partnerships,\u201d explains Amanjit Heer , founder of social media marketing and influencer agency We Heer You . \u201cFor example, there\u2019s no point collaborating with an influencer whose audience is majority in the U.S. if the brand only sells in the U.K. Having this on the media kit gives clarity.\u201d Potential collaborators need to know how many people you reach in their target locations and demographics, Ryan says. \u201cThe brand would not run Meta ads without first selecting the country, ages, interests, etc. to target \u2014 the smart brands won't run influencer collabs like that either. If you know the brand's ideal customer profile, reassure them that you reach those people.\u201d Here's a closer look at @brendenandellie 's audience demographics for Instagram, surfaced by a tool called Beacons.ai , a paid service creators can use to showcase their data. (You'll find more from his kit below.) Andreea Moise , founder of Hype Maven , suggests going a little deeper here. \u201cKeep in mind that section does need to be kept up to date depending on how fast the accounts grow. Don\u2019t include random numbers; keep it to locations and age segments. An even better thing is to include the audience's main interests and content preferences \u2014 why are people following you, and what do they get out of your content?\u201d Social media links You might think this one goes without saying, but Andreea has seen \u201ca ridiculous amount of cold emails from creators that don\u2019t include social links.\u201d Include your social media links everywhere to make it as easy as possible for potential clients to review your work. That means including links in both your outreach email and your media kit. \u201cEven better if they add it to their signature along with their social media channels,\u201d Andreea says. An \u2018about me\u2019 section Along with a high-quality photograph of yourself, be sure to include a brief bio about your personal brand and your social media mission. Why did you start creating content? Who are you creating for? What do you hope to help your audience achieve or feel? \u201cStart off by thinking about what you stand for as a creator and create a short bio,\u201d Amanjit says. \u201cThis is where you can sell yourself so the brand can buy into you and see if you\u2019re a good fit with their brand values.\u201d Karlis Adamsons, Community and Influencer Manager at Supliful , has seen a \"ton of influencer kits,\" he says. One of the things that makes them stand out to him is personality. \"A creator who infuses their kit with their unique voice and style instantly grabs my attention. It shows they're not 'just a stat sheet' but a creative partner.\" Ayomi adds, \u201cThis should help the brand can get a sense of who you are as a person/creator,\u201d \u201cThis is your opportunity to shine!\u201d @callmeaysiab certainly does on her about me page: Testimonials from brands you\u2019ve worked with After working with a brand, it\u2019s a great idea to get feedback from your point of contact and the company on what it was like to work with you. Follow up with them after the campaign and ask for metrics and the return on investment (ROI) of your work. Past performance data on brand partnerships can be a powerful dealmaker, Andreea says. \u201cVery few creators include this, but the ones who do are usually top one percent.\u201d Karlis agrees that showcasing impact is a must. \"Concrete examples like case studies of past brand wins or impressive engagement metrics with clear results (increased sales, website traffic) prove their value. Show how you can move the needle for brands. In my opinion, that's the golden ticket to a resounding 'yes'!\" Pro tip: If you can\u2019t get data from the brand, your own metrics \u2014 reach, engagement rate, click-through rate, etc. \u2014 will work fine, too. If you\u2019ve adhered to your contract, been professional, and met all deadlines, they should be happy to oblige! While this is not essential (and not always possible if you\u2019re just starting out), praise from brands can help seal the deal with new ones. Content examples Some screenshots of and links to your best work can also be helpful. Make sure these social media posts are relevant to the kind of content you hope to create for the brand in question. If you have them, it\u2019s also a good idea to include links to past collaborations or partnerships with brands. Here's a great client case study example from @itsgigirobinson 's media kit: \u201cMake sure you include clickable links, as brands don't want to have to spend time copying and pasting links or trying to figure out broken links,\u201d Ayomi says. Contact information Don\u2019t expect potential brand partners to slide into your DMs. Set up a professional email address tied to your social media handle, which you can use to manage all communication with brands. Be sure to include this email address in your media kit, and use it whenever you have any contact with brands. Fees and rates Including pricing for posts, videos, and stories on each platform can be helpful. Some creators opt not to include these from the get-go in the hope of negotiating the best brand deal, choosing to have separate rate cards, but busy influencer marketers and agencies prefer to have everything upfront. \u201cIncluding your fees on media kits is super helpful to avoid going back and forth on emails and ensures everything the brand or agency needs is in one place,\u201d Amanjit says. When there are various threads of communication going on with the creator asking for insights, fees, etc., it can get a bit confusing, so having everything in one document is ideal!\u201d Here's how @notboredindc clearly lays out her pre-set pricing: Influencer media kit format Now that you have all that information handy, avoid the urge to create an entire PowerPoint presentation. \u201cYou want to keep your media kit concise and visual,\u201d Ayomi says. Aim for a maximum of two pages \u2014 there is no need to share an entire presentation deck because, most likely, the brand won't have time to review it all.\u201d So, what should you use to create it?

      "content_text": "Before we launched our Buffer podcast , so much of our time and energy (99.9% of it, I\u2019d wager!) was spent getting the sounds and feel just right. We did all the podcast things we were supposed to do in order to make a really great podcast \u2014 the interviews, the mixing, the uploading \u2014 and now that the time had come to press publish \u2026 \u2026 we needed a plan to promote the podcast. How do people promote podcasts? We didn\u2019t know. We\u2019d never promoted a podcast before! So we went to work, researching all the best tips and strategies for getting a podcast seen by as many people as possible, downloaded as many times as possible, and maybe hopefully listed on iTunes\u2019 New and Noteworthy list. Here\u2019s all we found and all that we\u2019re excited to try. We\u2019ll be sure to report back with what works! The #1 Goal: Do Really Great on iTunes! iTunes is responsible for as much as 70% of a podcast\u2019s listens and downloads In the process of researching how to promote a podcast, much of the advice kept centering on iTunes as the key channel for growth and attention. I hadn\u2019t realized just how key iTunes really was! Nieman Lab claims \u201c70 percent of podcast listening happens through iTunes or the native iOS Podcasts app.\u201d Scott Britton says, \u201cListens on SoundCloud and YouTube are pretty insignificant compared to iTunes.\u201d Erik Diehn says, \u201cThere\u2019s basically Apple and then everybody else.\u201d I\u2019ve heard similar rumblings from others, too. When we launched our culture-focused podcast, CultureLab , my teammate Courtney\u2019s primary goal was getting to a good spot in the iTunes listings. She was our oracle: iTunes is really important. We\u2019ll report back with the specific numbers that we find for The Science of Social Media podcast . If you notice that a majority of the advice in this post is iTunes-related, now you know why. \ud83d\ude42 How to promote a podcast: 10 strategies to try Many thanks to the people and brands who have been generous to share their podcasting tips online. Some of the best advice I found dated all the way back to 2012, which shows just how long some folks have been excelling in the podcast game. I\u2019ll link to some favorite resources at the end of this article as well. Here\u2019s the big list of podcast promotion strategies we\u2019re keen to try. 1. Leverage your guest\u2019s audience Make it easy for guests to share by creating snippets and quote images We\u2019re fortunate that our podcast has an interview format, where we get to talk to amazing people like Rand Fishkin of Moz and Meghan Keaney Anderson of HubSpot . These people have big audiences. Rand has over 335,000 Twitter followers. HubSpot has over 1 million Facebook fans. What we\u2019d love to do is make it easy for our guests to share and promote their podcast episode. One idea is to send them a note on the day their podcast goes live and include a series of shareable media: Pullquotes Images Links Prewritten tweets and status updates Here\u2019s an example of one of the images we made for Meghan\u2019s episode: Here is the email we sent for Rand\u2019s first episode (feel free to copy it if you\u2019d like): From this thread on Growth Hackers , there\u2019s some interesting advice to treat podcast promotion like you would content promotion, an area in which we have a bit more experience. Here are the specifics from the Growth Hackers thread: Quality > Quantity Solve a problem Provide actionable insight Hustle just as hard to distribute as you did to create Leverage your guest\u2019s audience ^^ It\u2019s this last one that we\u2019re excited to experiment with in some fun ways. 2. Promote on social media \u2026 in a dozen different ways Share rich media, soundbites, video, images, teasers, evergreen \u2014 anything you can think of We\u2019re so lucky to have the amazing social networks that we do. There\u2019s just so much creativity and fun to be had with promoting a podcast on social media. For starters, share an update when the episode first goes live. Then, keep sharing. Here are some ideas: > Pin your episode tweet or Facebook post, featuring the iTunes URL. > Create quote images in Canva or Pablo. Share these as standalone social updates with a link to iTunes. Here\u2019s the Canva template that we\u2019re using. > Create 15-second soundbite clips. Upload to Soundcloud. Then share on Twitter. Twitter has a really neat implementation of Soundcloud audio specifically. People can play the audio right from their Twitter stream. > Tease the next episode 24 hours ahead of time. > Reshare the podcast episode multiple times. We do 3x to Twitter the first day, 2x to Facebook the first week. > Talk about the behind-the-scenes stuff in an Instagram story. \u2014 3. Release at least 3 episodes on launch day \u201cI actually received negative reviews from people who had listened to the first episode and were upset that there was only one.\u201d The above quote is from Pat Flynn, the founder of Smart Passive Income. His advice about launch quantity is right in line with the best tips from others, too. Publish 3 to 5 episodes when you first launch. From our research, the very minimum number of episodes to have at launch is three. In general, the more the merrier. We had seven interviews complete before we launched our podcast, with three episodes planned for launch day and two apiece for the following two weeks. This multi-launch strategy is a key part to Jason Zook\u2019s plan for hitting the New and Noteworthy section of iTunes , which, as we mentioned above, is a huge way to get traffic. Jason\u2019s plan hinges on these two concepts: Record and release several podcasts on launch day (3-5) Build your audience before launching if possible 4. Convert the audio to a YouTube video Name your video \u201cInterview with \u2026\u201d for potential SEO One thing we\u2019d love to be able to do with the podcast is to repurpose it in as many ways as possible. Some companies do neat things, mixing live video (on Facebook and Periscope) with the live podcast interview. We\u2019re excited to try a slightly different route. We\u2019re keen to add every episode of the podcast to our YouTube channel. With a YouTube version, you get a handful of benefits: Video to share on social media Closed captioning and transcripts automatically from YouTube (great for accessibility if you\u2019re not going to transcribe) SEO benefits This last one is really exciting. In some cases, Google values video 53x as much as text. So while we\u2019re hopeful that our show notes help us rank a bit for long-tail terms in Google, we\u2019re also excited that having a YouTube version could boost our rankings as well. Scott Britton used this strategy to good effect with his interview podcast, choosing a specific strategy of ranking for \u201c[Guest Name] Interview.\u201d So for us, this might look like: Rand Fishkin interview Interview with Rand Fishkin By adding this to the YouTube title, fingers-crossed, we\u2019ll see some good results! To convert audio (.mp3 for instance) to video (.mov), you can use a variety of different tools. Google\u2019s support center recommends iMovie for Mac users and Windows Live Movie Maker for PC users. I quickly hopped into Screenflow to build a fast video version of our podcast. Choose a canvas of 2,560 pixels wide by 1,440 pixels tall for best viewing at 2K resolution (there are a handful of other ideal dimensions here if you\u2019re not interested in 2K) Grab free stock video footage from Videvo or Pexels . Looping video is best; search \u201cloop.\u201d Include a quick thumbnail either of your show\u2019s logo or of your guest (or both) If you\u2019re feeling especially proactive, you can annotate the video with links, cards, and more from within the YouTube creator studio Here\u2019s one we made for our first podcast episode: 5. Submit your podcast to podcatchers and aggregators Podcatchers \u2014 a pretty cool name, right? \u2014 are simply apps that play podcasts. The most popular one is the main podcast app in iOS; it\u2019s the one with the purple icon and a picture of a microphone. Beyond the iOS podcatcher, there are dozens of other apps that collect and play podcasts, and there are a host of websites that feature new podcasts and assist with discovery. Here\u2019s a quick list of 10 of the more popular ones: Overcast Stitcher Podcast Addict Podcast subreddit PodcastLand (your podcast is automatically listed here if it\u2019s in iTunes) TuneIn Bello Collective Castro Podcast Republic Downcast PodcastLand has a featured podcast of the month, which is chosen by user votes. (In many cases, your podcast will work great with any of these services, particularly if you\u2019re already on iTunes. The best bet is trying each app out for yourself to ensure a smooth experience for your listeners.) 6. Transcribe the audio Try a service like Rev.com ($1/minute) or Fiverr ($5) A lot of highly successful podcasts offer a full transcript of the entire show. We\u2019re choosing to take a slightly different route with this, pulling out highlighted portions of the transcript and including these in the show notes. Would you rather have the full transcript? Or selected excerpts? The transcript is great for SEO benefits and as a place to collect leads (you can add lead capture forms and links to your show notes page). We hope to capture some of these benefits still, while saving time and money from doing the full transcription. 7. Throw a two-week ratings party One of the most significant factors in driving a podcast up the charts in iTunes (and into the New & Noteworthy section) is the rate at which you collect downloads and positive reviews in the first couple weeks. You have eight weeks from when your podcast launches to get to New and Noteworthy. The first two weeks of these are especially crucial. Here are a few party-planning components that can help make these first couple weeks after the podcast launch feel like an event: Run giveaways (more on this below) Throw a real party on launch day, either in-person or virtually via Facebook Live Publish two weeks of podcast-themed blog content. This post is an example! Switch out the email signatures on your personal email and on your team\u2019s support emails Get your teammates and company execs to p",

      "content_text": "I'm not TikTok famous. I don\u2019t have a blue checkmark on Instagram, nor am I a LinkedIn Top Voice . But I have a modest following across all three platforms, which I have been able to monetize. I\u2019m what some influencer marketers might call a nano-influencer, comfortably in that under-10K follower range. (I prefer the term nano-creator, but potato, potahto .) It\u2019s not a full-time income \u2014 this year, I\u2019ve netted around $3,000 directly from my content. But that\u2019s if you don\u2019t consider the spin-off work that has come from my social media presence, like freelance writing gigs and podcast hosting. Since I create content outside of my full-time job at Buffer and don\u2019t spend more than a couple of hours a week on it, I\u2019m pretty proud of that. Even more so because I haven\u2019t been focused on it for very long. I started getting a bit more serious about monetizing my work in 2024, a little over a year ago. I\u2019ve always loved creating content and had already built up a modest following on Instagram and a growing one on LinkedIn. I\u2019d also just started experimenting with TikTok (you can read more about how I got to my first 1,000 followers on TikTok here ). In that short time, I\u2019ve learned a lot about monetizing as a nano-creator. I thought I\u2019d unpack some of that here. So: if you\u2019ve ever wondered whether it\u2019s possible to turn a small, engaged audience into income \u2014 it is! You don\u2019t need a massive audience, but you do need strategy, consistency, and a strong, authentic voice. Let\u2019s talk about it. Jump to a section: Why nano-influencers have a unique advantage The main ways I make money as a nano-influencer How I find brand partnerships (or how they find me) What I\u2019ve learned about pricing and value Don\u2019t let imposter syndrome get in your way More resources for nano-creators Why nano-influencers have a unique advantage I\u2019m not rushing to \u2018beat the algorithm\u2019 or \u2018maximize my growth.\u2019 That\u2019s because I feel like I\u2019ve found a sweet spot in the nano-influencer category, at least for my bandwidth. I have the capacity for around three posts across platforms per week. This, I\u2019ve found, is enough for modest growth on Instagram and TikTok, and moderate on LinkedIn. Keeping within this cadence \u2014 and therefore, follower range \u2014 also allows me to actually connect with the folks who enjoy my content. I can thoughtfully respond to messages and comments, rather than post and ghost. Which means my engagement rate is really good , if I do say so myself. For example, the engagement rate for my last sponsored post on Instagram was around 5.8%. According to Buffer\u2019s Instagram Benchmarks data , the median engagement rate for my follower category is around 4.1%. Many brands find the higher engagement rates that smaller creators can offer to be far more beneficial than dizzying follower counts. That\u2019s not the only reason to partner with nano-creators, either. Let\u2019s review them all: High engagement rates. As I unpacked above, a smaller audience usually means a tighter-knit community. Authenticity. People follow nano-creators because they\u2019re relatable. We\u2019re not \u201cinfluencers\u201d in the celebrity sense \u2014 we\u2019re friends who happen to share tips, reviews, or behind-the-scenes peeks. Cost-effectiveness. To be candid, we\u2019re more budget-friendly for brands that don\u2019t have much money to spend on influencer campaigns. For a brand, working with 20 nano-creators might bring better ROI (return on investment) than one big influencer. The main ways I make money as a nano-influencer There are loads of ways to monetize on Instagram , TikTok , LinkedIn , and beyond. Think affiliate programs, brand partnerships, or even direct monetization on the platform. I\u2019ve not fully explored all of them yet, so this overview is not the be-all and end-all (definitely check out the guides linked above for more ideas). Rather, it\u2019s a look at what\u2019s working for me right now. Brand partnerships and sponsored posts This is the most obvious (and most talked about) income stream, so let\u2019s start here. I have dabbled in sponsored content on Instagram over the years, but it was inconsistent and never amounted to much. More often than not, it was a product-for-post trade exchange. (Now that I\u2019ve wised up a bit, I\u2019m hesitant about deals like this. Free leggings are great, but they aren\u2019t going to pay the bills! I\u2019ll touch on this again later.) Also, Instagram is no longer my heavy hitter. There\u2019s been a boom in interest in LinkedIn creators over the past few years. I\u2019ve seen relatively fast growth there, and it\u2019s my primary platform right now. LinkedIn has really started investing in creator functionality (which I chatted about with Callie Schweitzer, LinkedIn\u2019s Head of Scaled Programs, about in this episode of Buffer Chat podcast ). This, in turn, has opened doors for both creators and brands, on a platform where users tend to have more buying power. In other words, it\u2019s a fast-growth space that influencer marketers are keeping a close eye on. So it's no surprise that investing in LinkedIn growth kicked off my monetization journey, and it was pretty organic, too. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve partnered with several brands, all of which contacted me (more on this below). They were mostly interested in my LinkedIn content, but most of them were keen to bundle Instagram and TikTok into the deal as well. Freelance opportunities This is more of an indirect win of my social media presence, but it has afforded me opportunities I\u2019d not have had without it. Being a nano-influencer has helped me land freelance work. That\u2019s not just content writing, either. My content about podcasting and brand communities has helped me land a steady, part-time gig as a podcast host and community advisor. For me, freelance services often bring in more income than partnerships do. If you\u2019re a nano-creator with another skillset (design, copywriting, photography, etc.), lean into this. Share your work publicly, and you might be surprised at who comes knocking. Affiliate marketing My affiliate marketing earnings have been small \u2014 seriously, like under $5. Still, this feels like an area of untapped potential for me, particularly since income here is a little more passive. It also lends itself super well to content I love creating about my cosy desk set-up. Before I get ahead of myself: Affiliate marketing is a system where you earn a commission when someone buys a product or service through your unique referral link. The customer gets a recommendation they trust, the brand benefits from the sale, and you pocket a small percentage. Win-win-win. I\u2019ve set myself up on Amazon Associates, which allows me to create tracking links for the products I share. I\u2019ve created a little storefront of products I love and would wholeheartedly recommend on my Buffer Start Page . (You can create your own Start Page for free , by the way!) If someone buys a product after following one of my affiliate links, I\u2019ll earn a small percentage of that sale. Amazon Associates does have some fairly low rates (I won\u2019t earn more than 3\u20134% for most sales), but it\u2019s tough to beat for ease of use. Most folks already have Amazon accounts, and there\u2019s little to no friction for them when it comes to buying. The downside is that I\u2019m based in South Africa, and there\u2019s no local version of the program. My SA followers make up a good chunk of my audience and are less inclined to shop there. US, UK, and EU-based creators will definitely have more luck here. And Amazon is far from the only option \u2014 I\u2019m actively exploring affiliate programs offered by my favorite tools and tech, where the rates are far better for creators. I\u2019ll be sure to share when I have cracked that! How I find brand partnerships (or how they find me) Brand partnerships are my most direct and lucrative source of income and non-creator, so let\u2019s dig in here a bit. The $3,000 I mentioned at the top of this article? All earned from brand partnerships in 2025. You\u2019re probably thinking this involved a fair bit of cold outreach \u2014 but it didn\u2019t, interestingly enough. I\u2019ve never actually landed a brand partnership from pitching a brand. I have done so here and there, but never successfully. (My phenomenal teammate Tami Oladipo has, though \u2014 more on that in her guide to landing your first LinkedIn partnership here .) Pitching might still be absolutely worthwhile for you, so definitely give it a bash if you\u2019re just starting out with monetizing. For me, though, there are a few things that have worked far better for landing brand partnerships. Here is what I recommend for nano-creators looking to work with brands. 1. Get clear on your niche(s) There\u2019s a reason you hear this advice from loads of creators. It works! Still, choosing a niche doesn\u2019t have to mean painting yourself into a corner. Even if it\u2019s several connected niches (you could call these content pillars , too!). For me, that\u2019s marketing, remote work, productivity, and tech/tools. They\u2019re connected enough to make sense under one brand (me), but give me the freedom to experiment. For example, if a productivity software brand were looking for creators to partner with and came across my profile, they wouldn\u2019t be put off by my posts about cozy working or my home office. But if they find themselves bogged down by a mishmash of content about gaming, books, and musical theatre (some of the other great loves of my life), they might question brand alignment. 2. Post about brands you already love Your pitch is going to reach a very crowded inbox. But an engaging reel about a brand you\u2019d love to partner with? That will definitely make their team sit up and take notice. I\u2019ve found that tagging brands in authentic, non-sponsored content often sparks a conversation. For example, sharing how I use a particular tool in my workflow or why I swear by a certain product has led to reposts, DMs, and eventually paid partnerships. It\u2019s essentially a live demo of how you\u2019d showcase them if they did pay you. From the other side of the fence (I\u2019ve worked on influencer campaigns as a",

      "content_text": "Remember good old chronological news feeds? Back in the early days of Facebook, circa 2006 or so, posts were shown pretty much in order of recency when you opened up the social media platform. Well, things look a bit different nearly twenty years later. What started as a place for sharing updates and photos with friends and family \u2014 putting the \u2018social\u2019 in social media \u2014 has grown into a full-fledged content platform. Facebook has evolved from personal profiles to a space where people can follow creators and brands, join communities and groups, and promote events. Instead of just text and photo posts, there are now disappearing stories, reels, live streams, and much more. With so many new features available on the platform, it makes sense that the Facebook algorithm \u2014 the ranking system that uses machine learning to arrange content in users\u2019 feeds \u2014 has changed too. What used to be one chronological feed is now a set of different feeds \u2014 and multiple feeds means multiple algorithms. These algorithms work together to decide what content users see when they open the app. The Facebook algorithm is the lifeblood of one of the original social networks. It\u2019s what makes the platform so more-ish \u2014 so it\u2019s no surprise that it's developed an almost mythical status for brands and creators. Is there a secret to getting your content seen by as many people as possible? Understanding how the Facebook algorithms work is a solid start. When you know what Facebook looks for when showing posts to users, you can make more thoughtful decisions about what, when, and why you post. In this article, I\u2019ll unpack everything we know about how the Facebook algorithms work, and I\u2019ll share some tips you can use to get your content the reach it deserves. \u26a1 Schedule your Facebook posts and save time with Buffer Plan, schedule, and analyze your posts to Facebook Pages and Facebook Groups with Buffer\u2019s Facebook scheduling and analytics tools . How the Facebook algorithm works in 2025 The Facebook algorithm was created so that the Meta-owned platform shows users more interesting, relevant content that\u2019s tailored to them and keeps them scrolling longer. \u201cFacebook\u2019s goal is to make sure that you see posts from the people, interests, and ideas that you find valuable, whether that content comes from people you\u2019re already connected to or from those you may not yet know,\u201d the company says . To that end, there are three different types of content that will make it into users\u2019 feeds: Connected content \u2014 content from the people they're friends with or are following, groups they've joined, and pages they've liked. Recommended content \u2014 content Facebook thinks they\u2019ll be interested in from pages and people they don't already follow. Ads \u2014 content people see because of targeting, rather than the algorithm. Since this post is about the Facebook algorithm and not Facebook ads , I'll unpack the first two here. How the Facebook algorithm ranks connected content If a user is your friend (for personal profiles) or likes your Facebook Page or profile (for businesses and creators), your content may show up in their home feed when they open the app\u00a0as part of the connected content system. Here\u2019s how Facebook evaluates and ranks your content: 1. Checks what posts are available In the first part of this process, the algorithm looks at all the content that could show up in a user\u2019s feed. This includes content shared by their friends, the pages they follow, and the groups they\u2019ve joined. Right from the get-go, content that violates Facebook\u2019s Community Standards is excluded (more on this below). 2. Looks at signals The second thing the Facebook algorithm does is look at ranking factors called \u2018signals\u2019 to decide how relevant a piece of content will be to that particular user. There are thousands of possible signals Facebook considers that are based on both user behavior and the post itself. Here are some examples. The Facebook feed algorithm might look at how often someone\u2019s seen similar types of content recently (like photos or videos) and how much time they\u2019re spending on their feed. It also takes into account factors related to the post, like how many comments or reactions it has and how long the comments are, on average. Importantly, it also looks at how likely someone is to interact with the person who shared the post, especially if they\u2019re friends or in a group. That prediction is based on things like past interactions between them, both in public (like comments of reactions) and in DMs. The Facebook stories algorithm might look at how often someone views stories in general and how many stories (or sets of stories) they\u2019ve watched from different people or pages. It also pays attention to whether they\u2019ve missed any stories from a person or page they follow, how many photos or videos are in a story set, and if they\u2019ve ever replied to that person or page\u2019s stories with a message. 3. Making predictions Each of those thousands of signals is then used to make \u201cpersonalized predictions about which content [users will] find most relevant and valuable.\u201d In other words, the algorithm looks at users\u2019 past behavior to make predictions about whether they\u2019ll be interested in your post and likely to interact with it. For example, if you run a brand Facebook Page that they follow and visit often, and they regularly share your posts, Facebook knows they\u2019re a fan. They probably want to see more of your content in their feed. A less obvious example: If a user likes shopping in the afternoons and reacts to more branded posts during that time, Facebook will use that as an indicator to surface more branded posts during that time. \ud83d\udca1 Facebook ranking isn\u2019t a one-and-done situation. The ranking system is constantly evolving based on the behavior of users. 4. Scoring the content After all that, the algorithm gives each piece of content a \u2018relevance score\u2019. The higher the relevance score, the higher in the feed it will surface. At this point, the algorithm also mixes up the content to keep things feeling fresh \u2014 for example, it spaces out posts from the same creator or page so that users\u2019 feeds aren\u2019t filled with back-to-back content from one account (no matter how big a fan they may be). Once all the connected content has been logged, analyzed, and ranked, the algorithm then starts to throw recommended content into the mix. How the Facebook algorithm ranks \u2018unconnected content\u2019 for recommendations Facebook's recommended content system gives brands and creators a chance to draw in new fans and followers without any ad spend. It helps people in your target audience \u2014 even those who don\u2019t follow you yet \u2014 discover the public content you share to your creator profile, brand page, group, or event. Just like the connected content in the feed, recommendations are personalized \u2014 no two Facebook users will see exactly the same thing. Facebook uses the same four-step ranking process for recommended content as it does for connected content, but with a different, equally large set of signals. The feed recommendations algorithm might look at the type of post (like photo or video), how long someone watched it on their phone, and whether they\u2019ve tapped \u2018Show more\u2019 on similar posts in the past six months. It also considers how often they\u2019ve liked posts about a certain topic in the past 30 days, and whether they\u2019ve shared posts from that person or page before. The Facebook reels algorithm might look at how many reels someone has watched from a specific creator or page, which ones they\u2019ve clicked to view in full screen, and which ones they\u2019ve watched all the way through. It also considers factors like the video\u2019s length, what topic the reel is tagged with, and whether the user has liked reels on a similar topic before. Facebook has also shared detailed guidance on where it draws the line when it comes to recommendations, and certain types of content may be excluded. Since recommended posts are shown to people who may not already follow you, it makes sense that Facebook applies some pretty strict filters to keep that experience safe, relevant, and respectful. To increase your chances of getting your content recommended to new users, it\u2019s worth familiarizing yourself with \u2014 and sticking to \u2014 their rules. Facebook applies two sets of standards here. The first is its Community Standards , which are baseline rules for what\u2019s allowed on the platform. Content that violates these rules is removed entirely. You\u2019ll find the full list in Facebook\u2019s Transparency Center (which is a must-read for all marketers and creators), but here are a few common examples of content that violates these standards (and will be removed): Violence Crime Suicide or self-injury Child exploitation, abuse, or nudity Bullying or harassment Spam Inauthentic behaviour Misinformation Still, if your content doesn\u2019t overtly violate one of these rules, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s eligible for recommendation . Facebook has a second layer of standards: the Recommendations Guidelines . These apply to content that is allowed on the platform but doesn\u2019t meet the higher bar for being recommended to Facebook users who don\u2019t already follow you. In other words, the post might stay up, but it won\u2019t get shown to a wider audience through feeds or suggestions. Five categories of content are technically allowed on Facebook but may not be eligible for recommendations: Content that makes it harder for Facebook to maintain a safe community \u2014 for example, posts that talk about self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders; are sexually explicit; or promote regulated products. Sensitive or low-quality content about health or finance \u2014 like exaggerated health claims (such as \u201cmiracle cures\u201d), cosmetic procedure promotions, or business models that may be misleading or deceptive, such as payday loans or \u201crisk-free\u201d investments. Content that users generally dislike \u2014 including things like clickbait, engagement bait (such as \u201clike this if you agree\u201d), or overly promotional contests",

      "content_text": "A few months ago, I created an Instagram Reel that looked great when I was making it. I uploaded, hit post, and tapped on it to fill the screen \u2014 only to find a sliver of the text got cut off at the edge. It\u2019s a tiny detail that can make a big difference, especially when you\u2019re putting care into your visual content. There's something really satisfying about seeing your post appear exactly the way you pictured it. That comes from choosing the ideal Instagram image size so it lines up just right. No strange cropping, no weird blur \u2014 just a clean, sharp visual that fits perfectly into its space. Instagram gives you plenty of ways to show up \u2014 feed images, carousels, reels, and stories \u2014 each with unique Instagram post sizes. When your visuals match Instagram\u2019s recommendations, you give your posts the best chance of standing out and getting that all-important social media engagement . Whatever type of photo or video you're sharing, here's how to make sure your Instagram posts always look their best. \u2728 Just getting started with Instagram? This Instagram 101 guide covers all the basics from setting up an account to connecting with your audience. Jump to a section: How Instagram image sizes work Instagram feed post size Instagram carousel post size Instagram Story size Instagram Reels size Instagram profile photo size Instagram ads sizes Are you using a variety of Instagram post types? Frequently asked questions More Instagram resources How Instagram image sizes work If you look up \u201cbest Instagram post sizes,\u201d you\u2019ll usually come across two terms: aspect ratios and pixels . They might sound technical at first, but they're actually pretty straightforward. Aspect ratio refers to the shape of your image or video \u2014 whether it\u2019s vertical, horizontal, or square. It refers to the ratio between its width and height, and it\u2019s written as width:height. A square visual has a 1:1 aspect ratio because the width and height are the same. A 16:9 aspect ratio is wider than it is tall, so it\u2019s a horizontal post (also known as landscape orientation). A 4:5 aspect ratio is taller than it is wide, so it\u2019s a vertical post (also known as portrait orientation). Pixels are basically the tiny dots that make up a digital image. The more pixels an image has, the sharper and clearer it will look. To keep your Instagram posts looking crisp, you'll want to use the platform\u2019s recommended pixel dimensions as a baseline. Instagram supports a few different file formats, depending on what you\u2019re posting: For photos: PNG, JPG, BMP, and non-animated GIF files For videos: MOV and MP4 files Multiple post formats mean multiple Instagram post sizes \u2014 there's no single image size that works for everything. Instead, each format has its own ideal dimensions. Here's a detailed breakdown of what aspect ratio and resolutions to use for each post type. Visual type Aspect ratio Minimum resolution Profile photo 1:1 320 x 320 pixels Square feed post 1:1 1080 x 1080 pixels Vertical feed post 4:5 or 3:4 1080 x 1350 pixels or 1080 x 1440 pixels Horizontal feed post 1.91:1 1080 x 566 pixels Stories 9:16 1080 x 1920 pixels Reels cover/thumbnail 9:16 1080 x 1920 pixels \ud83d\udca1 An easy way to figure out Instagram posts sizes is to use tools like Canva . It has templates already sized for Instagram \u2014 so you can skip the manual resizing. Instagram feed post size Instagram may have started with a grid full of square images, but it\u2019s been nearly a decade since that was the only option. Now, more flexible image sizes let you experiment so each post stands out. You can upload feed posts in different dimensions, each with its own recommended size: Square posts work best at 1080 x 1080 pixels (1:1 aspect ratio) Portrait posts are verti cal at one of two dimensions: 1080 x 1350 pixels (4:5 aspect ratio) or 1080 x 1440 pixels (3:4 aspect ratio) Landscape posts are horizontal at 1080 x 566 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio) Square images are still a solid go-to. They\u2019re great for centered compositions, symmetrical layouts, graphics, or product photos that don\u2019t need extra framing. But sometimes, your image tells a better story with a bit more height or width. Portrait orientation gives you plenty of flexibility for your Instagram photos. It works well for subjects that fill the frame \u2014 like tall buildings or portraits (as the name suggests) \u2014 and also for shots where you want to zoom out to show the scale of a scene. Instagram user @thefacetpixel \u2019s slice of the Chicago cityscape is a great example of using portrait photos to show a dramatic vertical view. Landscape orientation is made for sweeping views and wide angles. @lifetreecollection uses this format to highlight the scenic vistas in their photography, capturing the full breadth of the moment. Whichever format you choose, there\u2019s one thing to keep in mind: your Instagram profile grid displays everything in 3:4 aspect dimensions. Make sure the key part of your visual is centered within this aspect ratio to keep it visible on the grid. If you\u2019d like to see how a post will look on your Instagram grid before you hit publish, you can preview this in Buffer\u2019s scheduling tools. Upload your image, tap the schedule button, and then head over to the Grid tab within Buffer to see what your latest post will look like on the grid. Instagram carousel post sizes Carousels contain a series of photos and videos in one post, and you\u2019ve got a few different ways to control how they appear. The platform takes its sizing cues from the first photo in your carousel. You can choose whether all images: follow the dimensions of the first carousel image display in their original, mixed dimensions convert to squares If you select the \u201csquare\u201d option or want all images to match the orientation of your first photo (portrait or landscape), Instagram automatically crops the rest. Selecting the \u201cmixed\u201d option allows for variety, but it comes with some formatting quirks. Instagram adds white bands above and below landscape and square photos while displaying portrait images at 4:5 aspect ratio. If you upload videos to a carousel, Instagram switches everything to portrait dimensions \u2014 even if your first post is a landscape or square photo. It\u2019s worth noting that if Instagram auto-crops your carousel images, you can't adjust that crop within the app either during or after upload. If you\u2019re working with different image sizes, you\u2019ll get better results if you crop them yourself before uploading. That way, you stay in control of how each visual in the carousel looks, instead of leaving it up to Instagram. Instagram Story size Instagram Stories are built for full-screen, vertical viewing, which makes vertical images and videos the best way to make the most of the space. The ideal size for stories is 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 aspect ratio). These dimensions help your story fill the screen without awkward borders or cropping. If you\u2019re working with a square or horizontal visual, there are still ways to make it look great. Tools like Unfold or Canva let you drop your image or video into a 1080 x 1920 template, which helps the visual feel more intentional and polished than a raw upload. Think of the extra space around the image as an opportunity \u2014 you can use it to add text, stickers, GIFs, or emojis to make the story more interactive. When creating Instagram Stories, remember that the app layers your profile info and buttons at the top and bottom of every story, so it\u2019s a good idea to keep those areas clear. Leave about 310 pixels of space free when placing text or logos. You can also add custom thumbnails for story highlights. These live on your profile indefinitely and show up on the grid. The platform is moving away from the old circular stories highlights that appeared at the top of profiles. Instagram Reels (short-form vertical videos) size All video posts on Instagram are now displayed as Instagram Reels \u2014 the platform officially retired IGTV from the mobile app back in 2022. Instagram Reels follow the same vertical format as stories, looking their best at 1080 x 1920 pixels with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Viewers see the full vertical video when they tap on it or come across it in the explore page or Instagram Reels tab. On your profile grid, Instagram Reels are displayed as thumbnails in the 3:4 dimensions when viewed alongside photos on the grid. Under the Instagram Reels tab on a profile, thumbnails are displayed at the full 9:16 ratio. That\u2019s why Instagram Reels cover images work best at 1080 x 1920 pixels \u2014 the same size as the video itself. You\u2019ve got two options for this thumbnail or Instagram Reels cover photo: pick a frame from the video itself upload your own cover image When you\u2019re creating a new Instagram Reel, tap Edit cover on the final upload screen. You can scroll through the video to select a frame or add a custom cover photo from your camera roll. To preview how it\u2019ll look on the grid, switch to the Profile grid tab. You can adjust the crop here if you\u2019d like. Either way, you're not locked in \u2014 you can update an Instagram Reel\u2019s cover image at any time, even after the reel is live. Just tap on the menu on the top right corner of the reel, select Edit , and then tap Cover to either choose a new frame from the reel or upload a new image from your camera roll. You can go back and give older Instagram Reels a grid-worthy thumbnail if you\u2019re refreshing your profile aesthetic. The Instagram Reels cover photo only appears on your grid, and it\u2019s worth paying attention to if you\u2019re curating an aesthetic Instagram grid, as @ioanapuiuofficial has done below. \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Looking for other social media image sizes? Here's our comprehensive guide to the social media image sizes of all major platforms , and a deep dive into Facebook image sizes . Instagram profile photo size Your Instagram profile picture appears in a lot of places on the app \u2014 your profile page, a user's stories tray, on the feed when you post, and in your DMs. To keep it looking sharp, use an image that\u2019s 320 x 320 pixels w",

      "content_text": "This post was originally published on joel.is . I'm delighted to share that we have introduced support for Bluesky in Buffer . This is an important moment for us as a company, and there are a number of reasons that adding Bluesky is personally meaningful for me. With Bluesky, we now support the three major social networks pushing forward a new era of decentralized social media: Mastodon , Threads and Bluesky . We have been intentional about moving fast to add these channels to our tool. Supporting independence and ownership in social media Buffer has now existed for almost 14 years, and throughout that time I've seen a lot change in social media, and in our space of tools to support people and businesses with social. We're an outlier as a product and company that has existed for that kind of timeframe with leadership and values left in tact. We've had to work hard at times to maintain control over our destiny. In 2018, we made the decision to spend $3.3M to buy out the majority of our VC investors and be able to go our long-term path. We have continued to carry out buybacks each year since 2018, and at this stage we are majority founder and team owned. One of the things I'm proudest of is that we still wholeheartedly serve individuals and creators , and have not gone up-market as many other long-running companies in our space have done. We've been fortunate to be able to scale to 56,000 paying customers and over $18M in annual revenue while taking our own unique path. Through intentional choices over the years, we have maintained a level of optionality over our future that most do not have. This independence is something I don't take for granted. Keeping ownership of our company, and through that ownership having an ability to boldly go in the direction we believe is best for customers and the team, is very important to me. This is why, as a business, we feel so philosophically aligned with rising new decentralized social media networks, such as Bluesky and Mastodon. These networks have been started with a belief that individuals should maintain ownership over their content and the connection to their audience. They have data portability baked in from the beginning. When you use these networks, you are much more likely to be able to maintain control over your content and audience than if you use social networks owned by large corporations with complex ownership structures of their own, and often with public markets to answer to. The larger social networks provide a level of distribution that's worth tapping into, but I strongly encourage investing a portion of your energy into networks where you will be able to maintain ownership long-term. At Buffer, we will be doing everything we can to support the growth of new decentralized social media options, because we believe that individuals and small businesses should maintain control over their content and the connection to their audience. The resurgence of the open web with social media protocols I have been eagerly observing the emergence and growth of social media protocols, in particular with ActivityPub (and Mastodon as the prominent implementation), and AT Protocol from Bluesky . Open standards in social media could be as powerful as open standards have been for direct and private communication (email). What I find exciting about the development of these open standards, and more importantly the adoption of them and traction of social networks which support them, is that they can bring forth a new era of open standards for the web. The Internet was built upon open standards \u2014 HTTP, URL, TCP/IP, DNS, HTML. A vast many valuable internet businesses have built on these \"shoulders of giants.\" ActivityPub and AT Protocol are built with open standards philosophies, and could similarly enable a new playground of innovation, with openness, ownership and interoperability at their core. I personally miss the earlier days of social media where the APIs had much greater parity with what could be done natively on the platforms. When I started Buffer, the Twitter and Facebook APIs were close to feature-complete, and brought about a lot of innovation in third-party development on top of those APIs. This is how Buffer was born, along with many other products in our space. Over time, we saw an era of closed APIs with reduced transparency and ownership of content and audiences. Mastodon and Bluesky bring the opportunity for a new era of innovation in our space, which I am welcoming with open arms. More innovation in the social media management space will be better for customers, and frankly makes for more exciting work to do. Bluesky is bringing innovation back to social media If you haven't had a chance to take a look at some of Bluesky's recent product and platform announcements, I highly recommend that you go and read them. In particular, what they've done with introducing custom feeds as well as starter packs gets me very excited about some real innovation from a social network. When I saw starter packs introduced, it immediately felt like a no-brainer feature for a social network, and such a powerful thing, especially for an emerging social network, to offer. Starter packs allow anyone to create a \"getting started pack\" for a new Bluesky user. This can include a set of recommended follows, and up to three recommended custom feeds (more on those below). This enables their passionate users to be able to personalize an introduction for people not yet on Bluesky. It's a smart way to activate users to play a meaningful role in onboarding new people to the network and grounding them with an existing community to interact with. Of course, Bluesky benefits by likely getting more people onto their new network than they would otherwise. Custom feeds are an incredible innovation that put the choice of algorithm for the social network in the hands of the wide range of users and different niche communities that exist on the network. The way that the Bluesky team have built custom feeds enables a ton of flexibility for the types of content alogrithms can serve up, and creates a marketplace for browsing and enabling different custom feeds you can choose to view. Something I've observed from the Bluesky team is their commitment to, and intentionality around, building tools for the governance of the network itself. It's very meaningful that on Bluesky you can choose your own algorithm and you can adopt an algorithm that someone else has written, or create your own algorithm for what content shows up in your feed. And I think it's very smart that Bluesky has done this \u2014 because it's both innovation and it's strong strategy because it's a highly defensible move which many of the other networks would not be able offer. It would be very unlikely for the commercial social networks to move away from the company, the network themselves, holding on to ownership of the algorithm and what is served up to you. I had a wonderful conversation with Rose Wang from the Bluesky team a couple of weeks ago and one of the topics we got into was around the values that are embedded in the Bluesky team and the work they're trying to do. It was clear to me how thoughtful and intentional they are being around the governance of the network and the flexibility they're building in to allow users to really shape the community and what is important to them. Something I appreciate about Bluesky is that their goal is to create a social network not controlled by a single company, while also ensuring that it comes together as a cohesive and easy-to-use experience. Decentralized social media can be daunting and feel complex and inaccessible to people initially, and so I think intentional work going into the simplicity of the experience is paramount. With great innovation from the Bluesky team such as starter packs and custom feeds, along with their focus on simplicity, I strongly encourage you to go and take a look at this new social network. This is a platform and community that's worth taking a deeper look at, participating in and investing time into. Join us in participating in a new era of decentralized social media By supporting Bluesky, along with Mastodon and Threads, we are playing our part in moving forward this promising new era of social media. Many of us in the team have been personally drawn to these networks for their special and supportive communities. We're here to see decentralized social media grow and become more meaningful for more people across the world. That's why we've put our scale, brand and resources into building awareness and providing tools to make participating on these new social networks more streamlined. I encourage you to add Bluesky to your channels in Buffer, and start participating in the social network today. Learn more and get started by visiting our Bluesky page.

      "content_text": "Question: How many social media platforms should a local business be using? Realistically, it is a challenge to manage multiple platforms well with the limited resources of a small business. \u2013 Keegan Edwards There\u2019s no end to the tasks small business owners have to juggle daily. When you\u2019re managing everything from strategy to sales, adding a dozen social media accounts into the mix is just not sustainable. Good news: it\u2019s not necessary, either. While social media is a powerful marketing tool, plenty of entrepreneurs have proved that quality over quantity is key when it comes to using social media to maximize their reach \u2013 and sales. So: how many social media platforms should you be using? Keegan asked this great question as part of our #AskBuffer series. He went on to share his own stance on the topic: \u201cI\u2019ve always recommended picking two that make sense for your type of local business. Two is feasible to keep up with and do well.\u201d We agree that making a selection you can keep up with is key \u2013 but there\u2019s a whole lot of nuance when it comes to exactly how many platforms to spend your time and resources on and (perhaps more importantly) which ones you choose. In this article, we\u2019ll dig into the factors that you should consider when making this important marketing strategy decision and help you find your social media sweet spot. How many social media platforms should small businesses be using? Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer that applies to all small businesses. To answer how many platforms you need to cultivate a social media presence on, your first port of call should be figuring out which ones you need to prioritize. To dig into that, first ask yourself: where is your target audience? Think about it this way: even if you have the resources to commit to, say, five platforms, are those resources well spent if your target customers aren\u2019t hanging out on three of them? From there, you need to consider your own business goals, the resources you have at your disposal, and what you have time for to make the best decision. The only real mistake you can make here is to spread yourself too thin. We recommend starting smaller, and perhaps adding another channel or two into the mix if you find the effort manageable (and worth it!). Let's explore each social media platform to give you a better idea of where your audience hangs out, plus share a variety of factors to consider when it comes to your business and how many profiles will work best for you. Which social media platforms should you be using? As a small business owner, you likely already have a good idea of who your ideal customers are. (If you don\u2019t, fear not; we have guides to defining your target market and creating marketing personas ). Once you know who they are, you can begin to uncover where those customers are. To help you answer that question, here\u2019s a birds-eye view of some of the most popular social platforms, who frequents them, and what they\u2019re used for. Facebook About Facebook\u2019s users* Monthly active users: 2.989 billion Breakdown by gender: 77percent women, 61percent men Dominant age group: 77percent of 30 - 49-year-olds Nearly one-third of global online shoppers use Facebook as their preferred social platform for purchasing. Facebook\u2019s features for businesses Meta has grouped Facebook and Instagram\u2019s business tools together in Meta\u2019s Business Suite . Facebook also offers Commerce Manager , a shopping catalog , and an inbox to chat directly with customers, meaning that business owners can literally set up shop on the Meta-owned platforms, as well as cross-post between them. \ud83d\udca1 Interested in cross-posting? You can use Buffer to repurpose your content beyond the Meta-verse, too. What performs well on Facebook Creating quality content to share on your Facebook page is the best way to drive potential customers to your social storefront or website. To put your best foot forward with the Facebook algorithm , make sure you\u2019re sharing: Meaningful, informative stories Accurate, authentic content Safe, respectful behavior Baby carrier brand Ubuntu Baba taps into authenticity on Facebook by interspersing model shots of their products with content creators by their users and even heartfelt posts from their founder, Shannon McLaughlin. Facebook supports a host of content formats, so you\u2019ll have everything from video to photo- to text-based posts to play with. Video content still sees the highest engagement (and thus reach), but as we unpack in our Facebook Guide for Small Businesses , every format can be valuable on this versatile platform. Instagram About Instagram\u2019s users* Monthly active users: 2 billion Breakdown by gender: 44 percent women, 36 percent men Dominant age group: 71 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds 83 percent of Instagrammers use the platform to discover new products and services 54 percent of users report having made a purchase after seeing the product on Instagram Instagram\u2019s features for businesses Unique to Instagram is Instagram Shopping , which makes your products directly shoppable within your feed. Instagram Ads are also popular as a pay-to-play option that allows you to target a specific group of users with your relevant content, even if they\u2019re not following you. If you regularly work with creators or want to start, Instagram\u2019s Branded Content tools make it easy to partner up. Instagram recently launched a new feature worth exploring for your business: Broadcast Channels . These channels allow brands or creators to send mass messages directly to followers who have opted in to receive them \u2013 great for preventing big announcements from being swallowed by the Instagram algorithm . What performs well on Instagram As a highly visual platform, it\u2019s generally beautiful, aspirational content that resonates on Instagram. According to an analysis by influencer marketing platform Heepsy based on number of profiles and engagement rates, the top 10 categories are media, fashion, music, arts, fitness and wellness, photography, food, travel, cinema and acting, and make-up. Formats supported on the platform include images and short-form videos via posts or Reels on the feed or within Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours. Birch & Bramble makes the most of all three by showcasing their work in photo posts and behind-the-scenes Reels and stories. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Olivia | Birch & Bramble Design (@birchandbramble_design) TikTok About TikTok\u2019s users* Monthly active users: 1 billion Breakdown by gender: 24 percent women, 17 percent men Dominant age group: 48 percent of 18 - 29-year-olds Just under half (49 percent) of users have said they have bought a product after seeing it on TikTok. TikTok\u2019s features for businesses Creator Marketplace will help you partner with the right TikTok stars for your brand Business Creative Center is a must-visit for inspiration and guidance. TikTok Shop (only available in select markets) allows you to create a storefront to sell products right in your videos and on your profile page's product showcase tab. We unpack all this and more in our Beginner\u2019s Guide to TikTok for Business . What performs well on TikTok A hashtag analysis revealed entertainment, dance, and pranks take the top-three spots on the short-form video platform, but fitness/sports, home renovations/DIY, beauty/skincare, fashion, lifehacks/advice, and pets are also contenders. Fashivly CEO Ashlyn Greer (who recently starred in our Creator\u2019s Unlocked series ) found success by rejecting perfectly polished brand content in favor of a grittier, more off-the-cuff style that creators tend to favor. Ashlyn regularly features in content herself and uses creator staples like greenscreen to create the kind of authenticity and spontaneity that thrives on TikTok. @fashivly @Reese Blutstein i want every thing \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79 #futurecollective @target \u266c original sound - fashivly X (formerly Twitter) About X\u2019s users* Monthly active users: 564 million Breakdown by gender: 22 percent women, 25 percent men Dominant age group: 42 percent of 18 - 29-year-olds Both traffic and ad revenue are declining \u2013 but so far, none of the Twitter alternatives out there are coming close to the platform\u2019s current active monthly user base. X\u2019s features for businesses X committed to focusing on shopping tools for users in 2021, a promise it\u2019s delivering on with Twitter Shops , Shop Spotlight (a place to showcase products at the top of profiles), and Live Shopping on streaming events. These tools have yet to be rolled out beyond the US. X Ads offers some powerful demographic targeting tools to help boost brand awareness, too. What performs well on X As we unpack in our Guide to Twitter for Small Businesses , you\u2019ll go far with pop culture trends and news, thought-provoking content, and, of course, humor and wit. A great example is workout app Sudor\u2019s quirky tweets, which rely on trending memes and gifs to connect with their followers.

LinkedIn\u2019s features for businesses Showcase pages make it easier for brands to segment their audience by creating dedicated spaces for specific projects, while Product pages will help you highlight special features and recommendations. Both are sub-pages of a company\u2019s primary LinkedIn page.

Buffer Best social media management tool for creators and small businesses Free plan/trial available : Yes. Free forever for up to 3 channels. All paid plans also have a 14-day free trial. Price : Paid plans begin at $6/month/channel. Favorite features : Store ideas, curated content, and any notes on the go using the Create space The Streaks feature helps you build and maintain a consistent posting habit The Start Page helps you ditch dry, boring, and generic link-in-bio tools and enables you to create a customizable landing page that\u2019s authentically you You knew Buffer was going to be at the top of this list, didn\u2019t you? Sure, I\u2019m biased because this is the Buffer blog, but I was a Buffer customer long before I was a writer on the team. The thing I love most about Buffer is its simplicity. On the surface, Buffer looks like a simple tool. Add your accounts, start social media scheduling , and you\u2019re A for away. But as great as that is, you\u2019ve just scratched the surface of what Buffer can do. You can store the social media post ideas that pop up in the shower or while walking the dog because the mobile app is so smooth, accessible, and easy to use You can create beautiful, branded social media reports for stakeholders and get metrics tailored to you \u2014 no more questioning, \u201cAt which times do I get the most engagement? Which posts give me the most bang for my buck?\u201d You can build your very own customized landing page in minutes. You\u2019ll be surprised at how easy it is to create, seriously Buffer is a pioneer in the industry for adding planning, scheduling, analytics, and more for new social media platforms. With new social channels entering the chat rapidly (here\u2019s looking at you, Threads and Bluesky ), you\u2019d want a social media management tool that\u2019s flexible and quick to adapt. It\u2019s one of the only social media scheduling tools that has habit-building features like streaks to help post consistently. And it\u2019s continually coming up with handy features you\u2019ll actually find helpful \u2014 like a template library to spark content ideas (especially when you\u2019re short on time!). This feature is still in beta, but it\u2019ll soon be rolled out to call customers. Besides this, Buffer has all the basics checked: You can schedule posts easily, respond to comments, use its AI assistant to help speed up content creation, and collaborate with your team easily. Buffer isn\u2019t the best choice for you if you run a large enterprise company with a complex social media team . Its features are simple, straightforward, and powerful. But they are primarily geared toward creators and scrappy small businesses. 2 alternatives to Buffer Loomly is also a good choice, especially if you\u2019re a freelance social media manager. It has decent collaboration features and approval workflows, designed for someone managing multiple content calendars. But it\u2019s not too complicated either (not a good fit for bigger social media agencies). It has a free plan for up to three social media accounts, but allows scheduling only five posts per month. The pricing of its paid plans is not publicly available. Metricool is also a decent alternative to Buffer. It can do all the basics of social media management, from post-scheduling to customized landing pages. Metricool has a free plan allowing you to publish up to 50 monthly posts. Paid plans begin at $22/month to schedule unlimited posts. 2. Hootsuite Best social media management tool for mid-sized businesses practicing social listening Source: Hootsuite Free plan/trial available : No free plans. Paid plans have a free trial of 30 days. Price : Pricing starts at \u20ac149/user/month for five social media channels. Favorite features : An extensive social listening dashboard to help you monitor trending keywords, competitors, and brand mentions Granular control over the access you can provide to various team members \u2014 perfect for complex teams You can stack your social media reports against competitors & your industry in general to examine how you\u2019re performing against these benchmarks Hootsuite is well-known in the social media management world, and for good reason: I love its social listening feature. Since acquiring Talkwalker , it has become even more powerful. You can choose your location and a topic to analyze, and the platform will give you an in-depth report about what people have been saying about that topic for the past week. Hootsuite also has an excellent team management feature. You can create multiple sub-teams and minutely decide what level of access to give to your team members. An A+ feature if you\u2019re a freelance social media manager or run a social media marketing agency. The AI assistant can also do a lot \u2014 there are options to use copywriting formulas to write posts, repurpose existing posts, etc. But on testing, I found most outputs need a lot of refining. I also don\u2019t enjoy how complex the home dashboard is. It\u2019s a bit overwhelming, and while feature-rich, Hootsuite definitely isn\u2019t easy to use. 2 alternatives to Hootsuite Keyhole is a solid Hootsuite alternative, specifically for social media listening. Its fundamental social media management features (like scheduling, storing ideas, creating graphics, and team collaboration) aren\u2019t as strong as Hootsuite's, but the social listening feature is a tad bit better. Better how? The dashboard is more user-friendly, and the audience insights are deeper. For example, you can also analyze whether the overall sentiment on a topic is positive, negative, or neutral. ",

      "content_text": "I\u2019m often surprised at how many marketers, creators, and social media managers underestimate Pinterest and go all-in on other social media platforms instead (TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are great, so I can\u2019t blame them). But Pinterest, when done right, can be a powerhouse in your social media marketing strategy . It\u2019s part social media platform, part visual search engine \u2014 meaning people don\u2019t just scroll, they actively search for new ideas, creators, and brands. One good pin can drive traffic for months (yep, just like Google). In this article, I\u2019ll share 11 actionable tips to grow your Pinterest following \u2014 whether you're starting from scratch or want to level up your current strategy . 11 ways to get more followers on Pinterest 1. Convert your Pinterest profile to a business account 2. Brand your Pinterest profile 3. Create search-engine-optimized Pinterest boards 4. Join popular group boards 5. Build a content calendar to pin consistently 6. Create rich pins 7. Use Pinterest trends to create trending content 8. Create SEO-friendly pins 9. Sprinkle human-ness in your pins 10. Link to high-quality and reliable sources 11. Monitor your Pinterest analytics 1. Convert your Pinterest profile to a business account You can have a personal or business account on Pinterest. If you\u2019re a creator or small business looking to increase your follower count, you\u2019ll want to switch to a Pinterest business account. Business accounts have access to: The Business Hub and Creator Hub to create ads A trends tool to discover the latest platform insights Analytics to monitor and measure performance If you\u2019re creating a new Pinterest account, you\u2019ll be able to choose a business account as part of the setup. If you already have a personal account, here\u2019s how to convert it to a Pinterest business profile: 1. Go to your account and click on your profile icon. 2. Click \u201cAccount management.\u201d 3. Look for the \u201cConvert to a business account\u201d option. 4. Follow the steps to add your profile name, website, and business details. 2. Brand your Pinterest profile Think of your Pinterest profile page as your introduction. It should clearly convey who you are, what you do, and what kind of content Pinterest users can expect from you. Your profile has four elements: 1. Your profile picture : If you\u2019re a small business owner, put an image of your logo as the profile picture. If you\u2019re a creator, choose a clear photo of yourself so people can recognize you. 2. Your name and username : Ensure your username is consistent across all your social media accounts to make it easier for people to find you. Ideally, it should be your name or your business\u2019s name. On Pinterest, you could also add some keywords to immediately signal your niche , as in the example below. This is a key part of Pinterest search engine optimization (SEO), too. 3. Your bio : Your bio will share more details about your niche \u2014 what kind of content you create, who your target audience is, how you help your followers, etc. 4. Your cover image : Your cover image is one of the first visual impressions on your profile. Use an image that helps you establish your brand and share what users can expect from your Pinterest content. \u201cEnsure your profile is also search-engine optimized \u2014 things like your profile description (bio) and name field [should include key search terms],\u201d Pinterest creator Shreya Dalela says. \u201cThese parts are also relevant in helping Pinterest determine what your account is about.\u201d Her own Pinterest profile is an excellent example. She uses a clear photo, various keywords, and a straightforward bio to tell Pinterest users what they can expect from her content. The goal of having a branded Pinterest profile is to convert viewers into followers and rank at the top in search results. Think: What would your potential followers search for to discover a Pinterest profile like yours? And sprinkle those keywords on your profile. 3. Create search-engine-optimized Pinterest boards Pinterest boards are similar to content pillars \u2014 they help you organize your Pinterest content into neat, organized folders. The Pinterest algorithm uses your board names, board descriptions, and pin content to understand your account and display it in the feeds of users who may be interested in similar content. Approximately 25% of search traffic on Pinterest is directed to boards \u2014\u00a0which means you\u2019ll need to include the right keywords in there so your boards appear on the results page. That means naming your boards something straightforward (and something users might search for). Think \u2018Halloween recipes\u2019 rather than \u2018Spooky vibes.\u2019 (Scroll on for more SEO guidance.) Shreya suggests first adding relevant pins from other creators to your own boards. This will help Pinterest understand the topic before you even add your own Pinterest content to it. She explains with an example of a \u2018lemon cake recipes\u2019 board: \u201cIf a Pinterest user searches for lemon cake recipes and then they start to pin a lot of recipes together, Pinterest understands that these pins are related to lemon cake recipes as a topic and forms a topical cluster,\u201d she says. \u201cTo make that work to your advantage, ensure you pin at least your five or six most relevant posts on lemon cake recipes before you begin adding your own lemon cake recipes to that board.\u201d How many boards should you create? \u201cFor new accounts, I\u2019d recommend doing keyword research specific to Pinterest and creating at least 10 keyword-optimized boards related to your niche or industry to start,\u201d Pinterest marketing specialist Katie Harp suggests. \u201cYou can add more over time if needed.\u201d Try to avoid creating boards you can\u2019t regularly contribute to. Focus on topics that are broad enough for your expertise \u2014 where you\u2019ll always have something valuable to share. \u201cYou can have as many pins per board as you\u2019d like,\u201d Katie says. \u201cJust make sure each board is related to a searchable topic or keyword phrase.\u201d You can also create \u2018sections\u2019 within Pinterest boards if your topic is broad enough to require them. \u201cBetween 20 and 100 pins in a board is ideal for those without board sections,\u201d Pinterest recommends . \u201cThe same is true for the number of pins within a board section.\u201d Pinterest also suggests having a variety of formats within your board collection. For example, if you have a recipe board, consider creating video tutorials, final recipe photos, and image pins with text overlays that display nutritional value, among other options. This \u2018 healthy snack recipes \u2019 board by Cookilicious is an excellent example of checking all the best practices of Pinterest boards. The board contains a variety of content types (video recipes and images with different styles but similar branding) and has over 72 pins. 4. Join popular group boards Group boards are collaborative boards on Pinterest \u2014 in other words, multiple users can contribute pins. Everyone who follows that board can view your content. Group boards can be an excellent way to gain more Pinterest followers, as they expose your content to a new audience. To find these community boards, search for niche-related keywords and filter the results by boards. You\u2019ll need to spend some time finding group boards that are open to contributors. If you want to skip that, you can also use Tailwind\u2019s handy group board finder . It\u2019ll help you find group boards that are relevant, popular, and have high engagement. You can easily spot a group board by its \u201cJoin\u201d sign. The board description will often include a brief overview of the board's purpose and any pinning guidelines. The board owner will accept or deny your joining request based on your profile and adherence to guidelines. This Halloween Eve decor board is a good example of what you can expect: Choose boards that: Are active and popular Have high-quality, relevant content Create Pinterest content for these boards consistently, without spamming. This will help you reach a broader segment of your target audience. 5. Build a content calendar to pin consistently Posting consistently is a non-negotiable part of increasing your follower count on any social media platform and the Pinterest app is no different. The ideal posting frequency for Pinterest is at least once a week. But to gain followers faster, you can post 15\u201325 pins a day, according to Tailwind . But keep 25 as your upper limit. \u201cI try to post at least 15 pins per day and not pin more than 20 times any day,\u201d Shreya says. \u201cAnything more than 25 pins could raise spam filters.\u201d The idea of creating 15 pins a day might sound intense, especially if you\u2019re managing everything yourself \u2014 but there are ways to make it simple and sustainable. Because posting 15 pins a day doesn\u2019t mean you need to create 15 new pieces of content. You can repurpose one post into multiple pins without creating fresh content each time. Create reusable Canva templates in different styles to speed up content creation. For example, Yasmeen Ali , below, uses the same template to create multiple pins (sometimes around the same recipe!) on her account. Another way to post consistently is to batch-create your content \u2014 that is, create multiple pieces in one sitting, then edit, repurpose, and schedule them to go live on different days. This approach forms the foundation of a solid content calendar . For example, if you're a food creator, your weekly workflow might look like this: Monday : Film recipes to create video pins and shoot or screenshot pictures for image pins Tuesday : Edit video content and tweak images Wednesday : Repurpose all content into multiple pins Thursday : Schedule pins in your content calendar While you can 100% create multiple pins with the same destination link (it\u2019s a good strategy!), be mindful of spacing them apart. \u201cIf you're pinning the same URL multiple times, make sure you're pinning them at least seven days apart,\u201d Shreya recommends. \u201cThis is also relevant if you\u2019re pinning the same URL with different designs on two different boards.\u201d Staying",

      "content_text": "Pinterest is the underdog of all social media sites . It marries the social media aspect with a visual search engine It\u2019s one of the most rapidly growing social media platforms It gives you a fertile ground to grow your website traffic If that wasn\u2019t enough, Pinterest ads also give you twice as much return on ad spend (ROAS) compared to other social media marketing channels. Pinterest advertising is also more cost-effective than other digital marketing avenues. Given all the benefits, why is Pinterest marketing so underutilized by creators and small e-commerce businesses? It\u2019s because the platform can be a bit of a mystery. It has unconventional features and Pinterest marketing isn\u2019t replicable on any other social network. In this guide, I\u2019ll share a step-by-step guide on how you can forge a Pinterest marketing strategy . If you\u2019re a total newbie to Pinterest, I\u2019d recommend reading this article first. It breaks down the basics of the platform that can help you better use the framework below. How to create your Pinterest marketing plan To create a solid Pinterest marketing plan, you need to tie four components together: Your ideal customer profile (ICP) or your target audience Your Pinterest keyword strategy Your pinning strategy Your performance analysis We\u2019ll tackle how you can ace each element in detail. \u26a0\ufe0f Note : While I\u2019m detailing each of the four pieces as a single step, remember they don\u2019t exist in a silo. They also don\u2019t need to be necessarily implemented in the same order \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve already done some legwork on your Pinterest marketing. In the end, the goal is to tie them all together to form a cohesive social media marketing plan. Step 1: Create a persona of your ideal customer on Pinterest Defining your target audience is often the first step of forming a social media strategy . You need to ask yourself three questions to understand your Pinterest audience: 1. Is your target audience using Pinterest? Pinterest is excellent for brand awareness. It has 498 million active users and 69.5 percent of them are women. Most of these women are aged between 25 and 34 . That said, since 2020, GenZ and men have been among the fastest growing user segments for Pinterest. It\u2019s likely that your target audience is already using Pinterest. If not, they will be starting soon. 2. What is your target audience using Pinterest for? Pinterest users often have that ready-to-buy attitude that\u2019s absent from other social channels. 46 percent of weekly pinners say they\u2019ve discovered a new brand or a product on Pinterest. However, Pinterest is a full-funnel platform. This means you have Pinterest users at all stages of the buying journey \u2014 awareness, consideration, and purchase. Part of your target audience might be coming for inspiration (awareness), another segment might be using Pinterest with an open mind to buy (consideration), and the last portion might be coming with a \u201clet\u2019s go buy!\u201d attitude (purchasing). For example, if I\u2019m searching for \u201chome decor items\u201d on Pinterest, I could be: In the awareness stage : Using the items I see as inspiration to decorate my own home In the consideration stage : Searching for items I could potentially buy to decorate my house In the purchasing stage : Have already decided on a few items I want to buy, but not chosen a brand yet If you look at the Pinterest search results for this query, they display results that serve all three user intents. 3. What\u2019s your target audience\u2019s pain point and how can you help them resolve it? The last question you need to answer is what your audience struggles with. You don\u2019t need a Google Slide full of data and analytics here. Knowing a few basic details is more than enough. This will guide your keyword strategy and then your performance analytics will help you understand more about your audience\u2019s problems (see how it comes full circle?). For example, suppose you\u2019re a food creator and know your audience struggles with making healthy meals quickly and on a budget. In that case, you already know some keywords you\u2019re going to target \u2014 like \u201chealthy eating,\u201d \u201cquick recipes,\u201d or \u201cbudget-friendly meal-prepping.\u201d To understand your target audience\u2019s needs, ask yourself the following questions: What job are they trying to complete when logging in on Pinterest? How can you help? What are the top ten most frequently asked questions you get from your audience? What does your target audience struggle with in your industry or niche? To continue the above example of the food creator, some content pillars they can have are \u201cMeal prepping\u201d or \u201cQuick dinner recipes\u201d or \u201cUnder $10 meals.\u201d These content pillars can become one (or more!) of your Pinterest boards. You can target more long-tail keywords within those boards and create niche pins. For instance, you can post a \u201cAffordable pasta with only three ingredients\u201d recipe on the \u201cUnder $10 meals\u201d board. A reminder : This audience insight doesn\u2019t exist in isolation. You need to supplement (and update) it with your keyword strategy and performance insights. Step 2: Build a keyword strategy for Pinterest Pinterest is a visual search engine. This means it uses keywords to understand your post's topic and rank it when the audience searches for similar queries. What are keywords? They\u2019re your audience's search phrases to resolve their queries \u2014 essentially, your content topics. But you have to be a bit more intentional about using specific phrasing and related wording to rank at the top of the search results. Let me illustrate with an example. Shreya Dalela, founder of The Creatives Hour , uses a primary keyword and several secondary keywords in all her Pinterest posts . In the above image, Shreya targets \u201cwall paint pattern ideas\u201d but also uses related phrases such as \u201cgeometric wall paint patterns,\u201d \u201cDIY ideas,\u201d and \u201cvibrant kitchen,\u201d to name a few. Using all these phrases helps the Pinterest algorithm rank her post in multiple search queries when it\u2019s relevant to the user intent. The above is a classic example of how you can use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to rank your Pinterest content at the top. How do you find relevant keywords for your Pinterest account? Pinterest doesn\u2019t share its API, so it\u2019s impossible to see backend data for the platform for keyword research. But here are four ways you can find SEO keywords for your Pinterest account: 1. Remember the legwork we did when we were narrowing down our target audience? That process will give you a rough idea of the keywords your audience might be using to find your pins. You can cross-reference this by searching for your industry keywords on Pinterest and seeing related keywords other creators are using. Also note Pinterest\u2019s recommended keywords in the auto-complete search bar. 2. Pinterest also has a trends tool to help you see which topics and keywords your target audience is searching for. 3. Pinterest also releases a trends report every year based on Pinterest user searches and behaviors. This can help you do some content planning in advance. These reports have an 80 percent success rate. So, there\u2019s a high chance that you can create useful content for your audience that\u2019ll perform well based on the keywords/topics in this resource. 4. Apart from this, you can also use SEO tools like Keywords Everywhere or Answer the Public to get some topic inspiration. But take these keywords with a grain of salt because these tools are designed for search engines like Google and Bing, not Pinterest. 5. Remember to use a mix of branded keywords (your company name) and industry-related keywords for the pins you create. Solution-aware buyers might know your company name and search for it directly, while problem-aware customers will search for topical keywords. Now, you need to use the right keywords in three places on your Pinterest account: Your Pinterest profile Your Pinterest boards Your pin designs & copy Let\u2019s address how to use Pinterest SEO in each place one by one. 1. SEO in your Pinterest profile On your Pinterest profile, you need to use keywords in your username, name, and bio. Username : You want to keep your username consistent across all your social media accounts to make it easy for people to find you. If you have any obvious keywords attached to your username already, that\u2019s going to help you rank higher in search when someone types the keyword you\u2019ve used. Display name : Like Instagram, you can extend your display name to showcase your main niche. Write your full name and use the \u201c|\u201d symbol to add a few keywords about what you post on your Pinterest profile. Your profile will appear at the top when someone searches for the keywords you used. Bio : Your social media bio everywhere should be about how you serve your audience and not all about you, you, you. That said, ensure you add a few relevant keywords organically about what you do and who you serve with your Pinterest content. Creators Nico & Louise of The Plant Based School have the perfect Pinterest bio showcasing how they help their audience at every corner of their profile with the right keywords. 2. SEO in your Pinterest boards You should have relevant keywords in your board name, your board\u2019s description, and your board cover. Travel creator, Alexane Said , is a good example of how to do this right. She categorizes her boards according to locations and uses descriptive keywords in the description to highlight what the board contains. Remember that just like Google, the Pinterest search engine also looks at your overall niche. If you consistently share pins related to one topic and pin each piece to the right board, the Pinterest algorithm will start considering you an \u201cexpert\u201d in your niche. But if you post about various things without focus, Pinterest will get confused. It\u2019s all interlinked. So, ensure the pins you add to each board are relevant to the keywords & topic you\u2019ve used in the board name, description, and cover. 3: SEO in your pin designs and copy Your pins are the me",

      "content_text": "As a millennial, I\u2019m not ashamed to be a Facebook fan, and it turns out that I\u2019m not alone. About 69% of my generational cohort is still active on the platform. Although only 37% of Gen Z are active users, Facebook still boasts a solid presence among older generations, with 6.6% of users aged 65 and up. In total, approximately 3.07 billion people log on to the little blue app every month. Facebook\u2019s size alone makes it hard to ignore. But it\u2019s not just about numbers. With its mix of generations, built-in community features, and powerful tools for targeting and content, Facebook is still a key player for brands and creators. Thanks to new updates in AI, video, and even e-commerce, it keeps evolving with the times, which means there are still plenty of opportunities if you know how to tap into them. All this considered, it\u2019s no surprise that creators and marketers want to know: How do I get more followers on Facebook? The good news: You don\u2019t need viral hacks or a massive ad budget to grow your Facebook following \u2014 just consistent, strategic habits and the right tools.

Here\u2019s how to get your first 1,000 followers across other social media platforms . 1. Set up your Facebook Page or professional mode A new padel court just opened in my area. Next thing, I see a \u2018People you may know profile\u2019 for the business. It\u2019s an easy mistake to make, but this is a crucial first step:\u00a0 If you want to get more Facebook followers, don\u2019t make a personal profile for your business \u2014 you need to create a Facebook Page. If you have a personal profile, Facebook users will only be able to add you as a friend, and they won\u2019t see a \u2018follow\u2019 button. To get more followers on Facebook, you have two options: Create a Facebook Page for your business , organization, or brand. Switch to professional mode. Here\u2019s how: Which option is best? In most cases, I\u2019d recommend a Facebook Page , which gives you access to more advanced tools like Facebook Ads Manager . Once you\u2019ve set up your Facebook Page or profile, be sure to complete every field available so that your followers and potential followers know you\u2019re legit. Here\u2019s a quick checklist of the basics: Featured posts to draw attention to important or top content. Phone number and business hours (if applicable). Action button (you can choose from options like \u2018Book now,\u2019 \u2018Sign up,\u2019 or \u2018View Shop.\u2019). Link to your website. Page category that helps Facebook show your page to the right audience. Bio or About section that contains keywords about your business, brand, or niche. High-quality profile photo and cover photo . \ud83d\udca1 Want to set your Facebook presence up for success? Here\u2019s your cheat sheet of recommended Facebook image sizes. 2. Share authentic content that starts conversations With so many creators and brands active on Facebook, the bar for quality content is high, but don\u2019t let that intimidate you. Facebook is pretty clear about what works well in the newsfeed. According to Meta , \u201cThe goal of Facebook is to connect people to content that\u2019s meaningful or informative to them. We are not focused on picking which issues the world should read about, but we are in the business of connecting people with content they find most meaningful. Publishers should ideally focus on what they do best \u2014 making content that is interesting to their audience.\u201d In other words, the content that grows your Facebook follower base is: the content that matters to your audience, and the stuff that you know a lot about, presented in a way that your audience wants to consume it. Here\u2019s how to do that: Understand your audience : Take the time to learn what they care about, what questions they have, and what kind of content they engage with most. Create high-quality, original content : Share your perspective, your expertise, and your story. Originality builds credibility and helps you stand out. Encourage interaction : Ask thoughtful questions, invite feedback, or spark conversations in the comments. Incorporate eye-catching images or video: Visuals stop the scroll. Use photos, graphics, or short videos to bring your message to life. Build trust through accurate, well-sourced information : Whether you're sharing stats, tips, or breaking news, double-check your facts and cite your sources when needed. Post consistently, but not excessively: Find a rhythm that works for you and your audience. Quality always beats quantity. Test and tweak : Try different post formats, topics, and times of day. Then check your analytics and adjust based on what\u2019s working. In a nutshell : You don\u2019t need to go viral to grow \u2014 just focus on creating content that\u2019s useful, true to your voice, and designed with your audience in mind. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more about how content is ranked on the newsfeed: Here\u2019s everything we know about how the Facebook algorithm works and how to get your content in front of as many eyes as possible. 3. Keep showing up Want more Facebook followers? You\u2019re going to need to show up on their feeds and continue providing value. I don\u2019t know about you, but when I look at a business page on Facebook and see that it hasn\u2019t been updated in months (or even years), I start to question whether they\u2019re still in business. It goes without saying that all social networks benefit from users actively creating valuable content there, and they reward people for doing so. Whether you\u2019re looking to grow on Instagram , build a personal brand on LinkedIn , or increase your following on TikTok , consistency might be the closest thing you have to a magic bullet for growing your audience. How often should you post? That depends on your target audience. Finding the sweet spot for your audience and growth will take time and experimentation, but my best advice is to post as often as you're able to keep up with \u2014 whether that\u2019s daily or once a week. The reality is that creating content takes work, and the last thing you want to do is burn out before you start to see results. 3 top tips to help you stay consistent and get more Facebook followers If you're trying to build an audience on Facebook, you don\u2019t have to be online 24/7. These three simple tips can help you stay on track and keep your content flowing, even on your busiest days: 1. Create a social media content calendar One of the easiest ways to stay consistent is by planning ahead. That\u2019s where a content calendar comes in. Instead of scrambling for ideas at the last minute, you can map out your posts in advance and always have something ready to go. A good calendar helps you spot gaps, stay balanced with your content themes, and avoid that \u201cwhat should I post today?\u201d feeling. Here\u2019s a guide to building your calendar from scratch (and yes, there\u2019s a handy template included). Pro tip: Buffers\u2019 Ideas dashboard helps you create, import, and organize your content so you can access everything at a glance and stay on top of your content planning. 2. Repurpose your best content Not every post needs to start from scratch. Take content that performed well on other platforms (or even earlier posts on Facebook) and give it new life. Turn a blog post into a quote graphic, or break a video into bite-sized clips. Your audience isn\u2019t seeing everything you post, so repurposing is a smart way to stretch your efforts and reach more people. Pro tip : Use Buffer\u2019s AI assistant to do your content repurposing for you. In just a few clicks, you can turn a single post into multiple formats and styles tailored to each social media platform. 3. Use Buffer to stay on schedule Using Buffer has honestly been a game-changer for me. Being able to batch content and schedule it in advance means I\u2019m not stuck posting in real time. Features like scheduling, streaks, and posting goals help keep me on track (and motivated), especially during busy weeks when social media would otherwise fall off the radar. \u26a1 We\u2019re building Buffer to be the most flexible social media management tool on the block. Save your ideas, organize them, get help from our AI assistant, and schedule your content in one single dashboard. Here\u2019s how. \u2192 4. Explore images and photos After analyzing millions of social media posts sent through Buffer, we discovered that images are the best-performing content on Facebook when it comes to engagement. Posts with a photo or image attached tend to get more Facebook likes, comments, and shares than any other type of content. Posts with photos tend to get 34.7% more engagement than text-based posts and 43.8% more engagement than video posts. This engagement tells the Facebook algorithm that the post is valuable, making it more likely to appear in other news feeds. And if your post is showing up in more newsfeeds, that means you may attract the attention of more Facebook followers. That said, Facebook Reels shouldn't be skipped, if you're comfortable creating video, as they can help new followers find you. Like Instagram\u2019s Reels feed and TikTok\u2019s For You page , the reels feed (right next to the Home button in the app) consists almost entirely of recommended content based on what the user likes and engages with. I clicked on the reels button on Facebook and was served this Saturday Night Live sketch, even though I don\u2019t follow Peacock TV (yet). I enjoy comedy, and I have a baby. Coincidence? I think not. Need help",

      "content_text": "Newsletters, as we know them, have been around for a really long time (even longer if you think back to pre-email times). They\u2019ve also been a mainstay of the Internet since its inception. Newsletters have become a major content format among creators, partly due to their appeal to targeted interest groups and because email is the next best thing to social media for reaching audiences. It\u2019s not unusual to be subscribed to 10 completely different newsletters \u2013 I'm probably subscribed to twice that number. Additionally, while platforms like Twitter or TikTok are at the mercy of ever-changing algorithms, your email list is something you own and control. Newsletters are a great, low-cost way to build trust with your audience \u2013 and brands love sponsoring them because the communities they can create are very loyal. Growing an email list allows you to create a community off social media, what Jay Clouse calls moving your audience from discovery to relationship. I'm increasingly convinced that premature growth on social media is an expensive mistake. Here's why: If you're taking this creator thing seriously, growth in reach should lead to growth in revenue. Social media platforms are Discovery Platforms that should be leveraged to grow\u2026 \u2014 Jay Clouse (@jayclouse) July 24, 2023 It helps that they are considered a valid business to start, with newsletters being acquired for millions. Different creators approach newsletter content in different ways, but the process of starting one follows the same pattern. In this article, we\u2019ll be sharing the steps to creating your own newsletter. Define your goal for the newsletter The reason you start a newsletter will define much of its journey \u2013 it's one of the most important steps before you even pick a platform. The \u201cwhy\u201d will determine the \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of this new format. So, as you start, ask yourself: Audience Connection : Am I seeking a more intimate, direct way to communicate with my audience? What would it look like to have that deeper connection with my audience? Content Depth : Is there content I wish to share that requires a more in-depth, nuanced approach that doesn't fit well within the constraints of my current platforms? How would it change my content creation process ? Monetization and Value Exchange : Am I seeking an alternative way to monetize my content ? What kind of value could I offer my audience? How would I approach monetization? Platform Independence : How would it impact my content strategy to have a communication channel unaffected by third-party algorithms? Feedback Loop : How do I build a mechanism to get regular feedback, insights, and suggestions from my community to better align my content with their needs and interests? Here's a template to determine how to start your own newsletter \u2013 you can get it in Canva too! You don\u2019t have all the answers before you start, but you do need to keep them in mind as you grow your newsletter. Pick your niche and topic No matter how you structure your newsletter, you must set clear expectations about what kind of content your subscribers can expect to receive when they sign up. Picking your niche for a newsletter is not the same as doing it for your social media \u2013 you need to determine beforehand what you\u2019ll be saying and who you\u2019ll say it to. Try Jay Acunzo\u2019s XY Premise Pitch exercise to find what will make your newsletter unique in a sea of similar creators. \u201cThis is a newsletter about [your topic]. Unlike other newsletters about [your topic], only we [Unique Proposition].\u201d For example, \u201cThis is a newsletter about sustainable fashion. Unlike other sustainable fashion newsletters, only we focus exclusively on affordable, eco-friendly options for students.\u201d There are a million ways to approach a newsletter \u2013 Matthew McGarry broke them down into ten methods . From his breakdown, we can gather that there are two main categories of newsletters: Curated content : These newsletters aggregate existing content from several platforms and around the web for a specific niche. Although it may look simple, getting subscribers to a curated newsletter is quite difficult and usually requires you to offer add-ons like proprietary data or unique insights. Original conten t: These newsletters provide in-depth analysis and insights on a concept, industry, or even a single topic. This format can be challenging, but well-thought-out content, interested parties, and good marketing can win you a loyal audience in no time. Chenell Basillio has grown her newsletter, Growth in Reverse , to nearly 15,000 subscribers in less than a year by offering deep dives into how other creators grow their newsletters. You\u2019ll probably find yourself mixing both \u2013 many creators do. The key is to be differentiated and interesting enough to keep subscribers coming back and potential subscribers curious enough to give you their email. Pick a platform There\u2019s no right or wrong answer to the platform to start your newsletter on, but as the options grow, it can be tough to decide. Here are some questions to consider when looking for a newsletter platform: How many subscribers can you have on a free plan? How easy is it to write and design a newsletter? How much does it cost as your newsletter grows? Does it have all the features you want for your newsletter experience? Is there an intuitive dashboard for tracking your analytics? How hard or easy is it to migrate off of? Are there proper spam filters in place to ensure successful email deliverability? To help ease some of the stress, here are the three most popular options and what makes them great (or not) according to these questions \u2013 do any stand out to you? However, if you already have somewhere you publish content (a blog or website) that can start sending emails, that\u2019s another option available to you. Ghost is a popular option among creators that also offers newsletter creation and publishing. Next, let's explore some newsletter designs to inspire the aesthetic of your newsletter. Pick a design First impressions aren\u2019t everything, but most people spend an average of 10 seconds on an email after opening it \u2013 so catching the eyes of your audience is more important than ever. Platforms like Substack might have limited design features, but creativity knows no bounds. The Rhubarb Society uses vintage images and a muted beige background to match the lifestyle and fashion content they publish. The Rhubarb Society's Substack landing page The Rhubarb Society's newsletter design Use visually striking colors and motion graphics as header images to always stand out, like the AI newsletter Ponderer (whose founder offers Beehiiv design training ). Ponderer's Beehiiv landing page Ponderer's newsletter design Or do a whole rebrand with custom and distinctive graphic line breaks, like VPLand did in a recent design update. Beyond the look of your newsletter, the layout and format are also vital. Over half of all emails are opened on mobile devices, so prioritize the mobile experience. Newsletter Design Tip Over half of all emails are opened on mobile. Ensure your newsletter design is mobile-friendly for the best reader experience. Prioritize mobile > desktop pic.twitter.com/83zk02bLc8 \u2014 Eric from Exploding ideas (@ericlamideas) July 21, 2023 Determine your strategy Developing a strategy for your newsletter will help you accomplish two things: showing your audience how serious you are and keeping you accountable. Part of strategy is your: Publishing cadence : Frequency sets expectations. Whether you're sending your newsletter daily, bi-weekly, weekly, or monthly, deciding what\u2019s manageable for you and considering what your audience would appreciate is crucial. If weekly feels right, but life gets in the way? No shame in adjusting to bi-weekly. However, it's not just about frequency but consistency. If your audience expects a monthly digest, ensure they receive it monthly or communicate otherwise \u2013 that\u2019s p art of trust-building . Content plan: What will you be publishing? Who are you writing for? Does it need to be planned out beforehand, or will you write the night before scheduling (this is me)? A newsletter for industry professionals will look different from one for casual enthusiasts. Tailor your content to meet the needs and interests of your readers. Distribution plan: How will you get your newsletter into your readers' hands (or inboxes)? Whether leveraging social media, cross-promoting with fellow creators, or optimizing your website's SEO for sign-ups, sketching a distribution strategy ensures your hard work gets the visibility it deserves. The initial days of any venture are filled with experimentation \u2013 embrace it! Your strategy might evolve as you gauge your capacity, gather feedback, and grow your subscribers. That's the beauty of it \u2014 your newsletter, your rules. Deliver your first issue Your first newsletter issue isn't just an email; it's a statement. It's your grand entry, the opening note of your symphony. Here's how to make it resonate: Set the tone with authenticity : Introduce yourself and your vision for the newsletter. Readers appreciate knowing the human behind the content. Share a story, an anecdote, or what inspired you to start this journey. Pack a punch with quality : First impressions last. Your inaugural content should exemplify the value you aim to deliver consistently. Whether it\u2019s an insightful article, a roundup of resources, or a personal reflection, ensure it stands out and speaks to your audience. Invite interaction : Encourage your subscribers to hit 'reply.' Whether they're sharing feedback, posing questions, or simply saying 'hello,' building a two-way dialogue from the start fosters a sense of community and belonging. Remember, your first issue plants the seed for a blossoming relationship with your subscribers. Water it with passion, authenticity, and commitment.

      "content_text": "For the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been using Buffer to build a posting habit on LinkedIn. I\u2019ve been sharing what I\u2019m learning, posting about work and life, and trying to stay consistent. But one thing has always been missing: a simple way to see what\u2019s working. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re introducing today: LinkedIn Profile Analytics , now available inside Buffer. Why we built this Until now, LinkedIn has mostly reserved detailed analytics for company Pages. But many creators, freelancers, solopreneurs, consultants, and folks like me are building audiences directly from personal profiles. That is where the conversations happen. That is where most people are posting. We partnered directly with LinkedIn and are proud to be an official launch partner for their new Analytics API. This new API finally makes it possible to track metrics for personal profiles, and we\u2019re thrilled to bring it to Buffer users on day one. What's new Inside Buffer, you can now view post-level analytics for your LinkedIn personal profile. For each post, you\u2019ll see: Total impressions Reactions Comments Shares Engagement rate Views Watch time Unique viewers for video posts. Right now, LinkedIn personal profile analytics live inside the Sent Posts tab within the Publishing area of Buffer. Longer term, we have bigger plans for our analytics feature, and we\u2019re excited about where this will go next. How I\u2019m using it personally I try to post on LinkedIn at least three times a week. Some weeks are smoother than others. I\u2019ve got a full-time job and three young kids, including twins. Like everyone, life sometimes gets busy. But staying consistent has unlocked an amazing amount of growth. In the past 28 days alone, I\u2019ve reached nearly 30,000 people on LinkedIn. My top-performing post, a personal story about balancing work, family, and health, has 14,179 impressions and counting. That kind of feedback is both motivating and incredibly helpful in guiding what I share next. I post a mix of product marketing advice, personal reflections, behind-the-scenes content, and new Buffer features. The new analytics help me: Spot patterns . Which types of posts drive more conversation? Which formats seem to land better? Stay consistent . Having post-level data helps me keep my rhythm, even during busy weeks. Fine-tune topics . The data nudges me toward themes that seem to spark more engagement and interaction. I don't try to overthink every metric; I just try to get enough signal to keep learning and improving. How to get started If you\u2019ve already connected your LinkedIn personal profile to Buffer for scheduling, you\u2019ll need to refresh your connection, then you\u2019re all set. Your analytics will be ready and waiting inside your Sent Posts tab. If you haven\u2019t connected to LinkedIn yet, you can do so from your Buffer dashboard. Add LinkedIn as a channel to Buffer Look at your 'Sent Posts' tab to see analytics Now you\u2019ll be able to plan, publish, and now analyze your LinkedIn content all in one place. More to come We\u2019re bullish on LinkedIn as a platform for creators. More people are building real audiences, sharing expertise, growing businesses, and finding real opportunities from their personal profiles. This is just the start. We\u2019re excited to keep building tools that make it easier to grow on LinkedIn and across every platform you use.

How to set up your Bluesky account Getting started on Bluesky is straightforward. In a few simple steps, you'll be ready to dive into the world of decentralized social media.

Fill in your name, handle, email address, and create a password. Then, Complete the captcha challenge to finish setting up your account. Setting up a custom domain Bluesky handles self-verification differently than other networks where you might need to go through an approval process for verification. On Bluesky, you can self-verify by changing your handle to a custom domain. Setting up a custom domain is easy, you'll just need access to your domain manager or to work alongside someone from your team who has access to your domain. The process is straightforward and often works in minutes. For example, we made our Bluesky handle buffer.com , which verifies to everyone that we are the real Buffer account. Here's how I set up mine: In your Settings, tap Account Select Handle and then \"I have my own domain\" Follow the instructions to add a new DNS record to your domain in your domain manager. You're done! \ud83d\udca1 For a more in-depth guide to setting up a custom domain as a handle, check out this guide .

Make sure you complete all the details to build trust and engagement. Upload a\u00a0profile picture\u00a0that represents you or your brand You can create an avatar using a pre-created icon, but to build trust and recognition, I recommend using the same profile picture and display name as your other social media accounts. Select your interests to help surface relevant content as you learn how to navigate the platform. And that's it for setting up! How to set up your Bluesky account and feed The biggest selling point of Bluesky is its customization. You can modify pretty much everything. Think through what you want to see. Do you like seeing replies in your main feed or not? Do you want chronological and only people you are following? No problem. If you have strong preferences or opinions or just want to make your setup unique, it can all be done. I\u2019ll break down the two paths you could follow to set up your account: The Simple Route, or The Customization Route The Simple Route to Bluesky If you want to dive into Bluesky without delving into extensive customizations, the platform offers a straightforward path to begin your social media journey. Here's how to get started: 1. Bridge your followers with SkyBridge Transitioning from platforms like Twitter to Bluesky is seamless with tools like SkyBridge. This browser extension helps you find and follow your existing Twitter connections on Bluesky, ensuring you maintain your network.

Populate your feed by following people A vibrant feed is central to an engaging social media experience. Start by following individuals and organizations that align with your interests. Bluesky's 'Discover' feature showcases trending topics and suggested users. You can also use the search bar to find specific users, hashtags, or topics. And don\u2019t just follow \u2014 engage. Engaging with content not only enriches your feed but also fosters connections within the community. 3. Engage with posts Active participation is key to building a presence on Bluesky. Regularly interacting with posts keeps your profile active and visible. Set aside time each day to interact with your feed and participate in discussions relevant to your interests. Use Starter Packs To further enhance your experience, consider using Bluesky's \"Starter Packs.\" Starter Packs are curated collections of accounts are designed to help you quickly find users with shared interests. With a single click, you can follow all accounts within the selected pack, instantly enriching your feed. Here\u2019s one of mine: Check it out Here\u2019s a handy directory of Starter Packs to look through, and users tend to share them freely, so keep an eye on your feed as well. Starter Packs are an excellent way to immerse yourself in the Bluesky community and discover new content without extensive searching. \ud83d\udca1 If you have a collection of accounts or feeds to share, check out Bluesky\u2019s guide to setting up a Starter Pack of your own The Customization Route Now, if you want to explore Bluesky a bit deeper, this section is for you. The platform offers a range of customization options to enhance your user experience. Here\u2019s how to make Bluesky truly your own: Content moderation Bluesky offers a wide range of content moderation tools, allowing you to fine-tune your feed down to the last detail. Set your language preferences : Select the languages you want to appear in your feed. Mute words and phrases : Block specific words or phrases to filter out unwanted content. You can also exclude certain accounts from these muted terms, offering nuanced control over your feed. Block specific groups of people : An alternative way to use Starter Packs and lists is as a block list of people whose content you don\u2019t want to see in your feed. Customize feed content : Decide whether to display replies, reposts, or quote posts in your main feed, tailoring the content you see to your liking. Sort replies You can sort replies to your threads, allowing you to organize conversations according to your preferences. Navigate to the specific thread you wish to customize. Tap the settings icon within the thread interface. Select from options such as: Newest first: Displays the most recent replies at the top. Oldest first: Shows replies in chronological order. People you follow: Prioritizes replies from users you follow. Custom feeds Bluesky\u2019s custom feeds allow you to choose or create algorithms that dictate the content on your timeline. You can explore existing feeds by opening the Menu (the three lines \u2261 at the top left of your screen) and tapping into Feeds. Or selecting the # symbol at the top right of the screen on mobile. Here, you\u2019ll see a variety of user-created feds catering to specific interests (like BlackSky and Art: What\u2019s Hot) or scenarios (like Quiet Posters, which surfaces content from your less active followers) You can also create your own feed in one of two ways: Determine the parameters for your feed, such as specific hashtags, user lists, or content types. Use Bluesky's Feed Generator Starter Kit to build your custom feed without extensive coding knowledge. Direct Message settings You can customize your DM experience, allowing you to control who can/can\u2019t contact you and how you receive notifications. To adjust your DM settings; Open the Bluesky app and tap the chat icon to enter your DMs Tap the settings icon within the DM interface. Choose from the following options: Everyone: Allow any Bluesky user to send you a DM. Users I follow: Restrict DMs to only those you follow. No one: Disable DMs entirely. Toggle notification sounds for incoming DMs on or off, based on your preference. Custom servers/PDS In addition to custom domains, you can actually self-host your Bluesky account. And yes, custom servers are supported in Buffer, so you can still schedule your posts. No clue what I'm talking about? Here's a simple explanation: Essentially, unlike other social networks, you can self-host an instance of Bluesky. Self-hosting a Bluesky PDS means running your own Personal Data Server that is capable of connecting with the wider Bluesky social network. Think about this as the difference between hosting your website on another site, e.g., yourname.wordpress.com instead of hosting it yourself and having your website on your own domain. So on Bluesky, most people are using the Bluesky hosted instance, which is what anyone gets when they sign up. If you, however, would prefer to host Bluesky yourself on your own server, you can do that. Some people prefer this for better data privacy and overall control. \ud83d\udca1 If you'd like to self-host your Bluesky account, check out this tutorial .

      "content_text": "As you might have guessed from the title of this article, I have something of an\u2026 obsession? with productivity tools. I have ADHD (shout out to all the folks who were diagnosed as adults!) and I lean heavily on systems to help me focus and stay productive. But \u2014 likely also because of the ADHD \u2014 I love trying new things. Which means I\u2019ve never met a new tool I didn\u2019t sign up for in about 2.5 seconds. I find that the freshness of new tools helps motivate me to stay on task, too. Hey, a system is a system, right? So, confession: over the past year or so, I have tried no less than 57 productivity tools. (I tracked it all in Notion, naturally \u2014 pop me a message if you want to see the receipts). And yet, there are several apps that I keep coming back to, or have stuck with permanently, on my tooling travels. Before we get into it, I want to acknowledge that \u2018productivity tool\u2019 is a really broad term. These days, you\u2019ll find it applied to everything from email add-ons to AI writing tools and ChatGPT . While these other apps and tools can undoubtedly help boost efficiency, in this article, I\u2019m zeroing in on productivity tools in the more traditional sense \u2014 those that help me stay organized, plan my day, and stay focused. If that sounds like it might be up your alley, let\u2019s get into it. Jump to a tool: Todoist Akiflow Routine Toggl Track Sunsama Brain.fm Focus Traveller Notion Superlist Todoist Best free productivity tool for managing your tasks Todoist \u2014 no matter how many tools I try, I somehow always find my way back to you. It just\u2026 works. Todoist is a planning tool that will make sense for most people's working styles \u2014 it has lists, kanbans, and a time-blocking calendar view (on the paid plan). While there are some features I\u2019d love to see added (the ability to color-code time blocks is high up on my wishlist), Todoist is a wonderful second brain for tasks and projects. While it is very customizable, it doesn\u2019t require much configuration to get started. It also has great templates based on well-known productivity systems, like Getting Things Done, The Eisenhower Matrix, and more. Todoist plays really well with a bunch of other tools, too \u2014 you can easily add Slack messages as tasks, for example. If you're looking to use it on a larger scale, it works really well for teams, both corporate and otherwise. My husband and I have several projects we collab on \u2014 and I do rather enjoy assigning tasks to him. Most of these features are available on their free plan, but their paid plan is pretty affordable, too. My favorite features: Comprehensive free plan Beautiful web, desktop, and app versions Natural language processing, so you can type \u2018Email Hailley tomorrow\u2019 and the task will be added to your list for the next day. \u2018Karma\u2019 \u2014 a simple gamification system that gives you karma as you complete tasks Cost: Free, with paid plans starting at $5 per month. \u26a1 Looking for productivity tools with loads of AI features ? Check out my list of 8 of the Best AI Productivity Tools to Help You Optimize How You Work . Akiflow Best productivity tool for consolidating tasks from everywhere Akiflow is pretty much the end of notification overwhelm. It goes beyond task manager \u2014 Akiflow is a task consolidator. It integrates with your email, Slack, Notion, Todoist, Asana, Trello, and a bunch of other tools and pulls them into a single inbox as tasks. From there, you can organize these tasks into both folders and projects and then map them out on your calendar. So, for example, if I save a message in Slack, it will show up as a task in my inbox in Akiflow. From there, I can schedule it for a specific day, Another feature I love (and that many of the productivity tools are missing) is analytics. Every task that is assigned a duration or time-blocked in your calendar \u2014 and completed \u2014 is tracked. From there, you can get a big picture look at how long you spent on certain projects, tasks, or in meetings. I find it super motivating to see how much work I managed to get through in one day. It\u2019s also really handy, if, like me, you\u2019re working on multiple projects outside your 9-5. With Akiflow, I can track how many hours I spend on freelance work or my personal social media content. It also has daily planning and shutdown rituals, really solid productivity analytics, plus a calendar booking feature like Calendly. Now, Akiflow is pricey but they offer loads of really solid discounts if you subscribe to their emails or do their 7-day trial, which is what has made it affordable for me. My favorite features: Fast and frequent updates and new features Daily \u2018rituals\u2019 to help you get started and review your day\u2019s work AI assistant, \u2018Aki,\u2019 which can help you organize your day A huge list of integrations with other tools Simple analytics to help you get a sense of how much time you\u2019re spending in specific areas Cost: $34 monthly or $19 monthly paid annually. Keep an eye out for regular promos. Routine Best productivity tool with a focused daily view If your never-ending to-do list tends to get too overwhelming when captured in a system, I hear you. Sometimes the endless stream of boxes to check can get a little too much, prompting me to close the app, and hit YouTube instead. That\u2019s where a tool like Routine comes in. It is a truly beautifully designed app that integrates with your calendar to pull in your events and even Notion to pull in tasks. It is wonderful for time blocking, which plays well with my favorite feature, the focused today view. It only shows you items you have planned for that day, which is great for helping reduce overwhelm. It\u2019s a little different from most task managers in that you can organize your tasks within pages rather than folders, where you can create notes as well, which is interesting. The only downside for my unicorn brain with this app is that there\u2019s no easy way to color-code your tasks in your calendar. Routine has a really exciting roadmap, so I\u2019m definitely keeping an eye on all the features they have planned for this year. Best part \u2014 Routine has a comprehensive free plan. It will cost you nothing. My favorite features: Focused \u2018Today\u2019 view to reduce overwhelm Minimalist, clean interface Solid list of integrations to consolidate tasks from elsewhere Cost: Free, with paid plans starting at $10 per month. Toggl Track Best productivity tool for time tracking If you\u2019ve ever finished a workday and wondered, \u201cWhat did I even do today?\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s me, hi \u2014 then it\u2019s time to explore Toggl Track . It\u2019s one of the simplest time tracking tools I\u2019ve ever used, and it helps me stay honest about where my time is actually going. You can track by project or task, and even set billable rates if you\u2019re freelancing. You can track your time retroactively or live as you work. Hitting the start button on a time-tracking task is like an instant productivity boost for me. Because my time is being recorded, I\u2019m way less likely to bounce between tasks or fall down a TikTok rabbit hole. The reporting features are surprisingly satisfying, too. Even if you don\u2019t track every minute, doing it can offer really helpful insight. Are you spending too much time on a side project, or tasks that are technically outside of your scope? There are some other tools on this list that have analytics, but nothing quite on the level of Toggl. You can drill down by time period, project, or task \u2014 and have a handy bar/pie/line graph to go along with it. The integrations are my absolute favorite. Thanks to a clever browser extension, Toggl Track pairs with almost any web-based tool, so you don\u2019t even need to open Toggl to start tracking. With the extension enabled, the little pink \u2018start\u2019 button can appear on everything from Google Docs to Notion pages to emails. One of my favorite workflows is to timeblock in Todoist, then start a Toggle task within the Todoist web app. That way, I only need to log into Toggl to review the analytics. My favorite features: Smooth integrations with a mindblowing number of tools Multiple ways to visualize your productivity data Ability to export reports to share with managers Easily connect your timed work to invoices \u2014\u00a0amazing for freelancers. Cost: Free, with paid plans starting at $10 Sunsama Best productivity tool for mindful planning I need the tools I use to be aesthetically pleasing. If they\u2019re not, I just can\u2019t bring myself to use them. The bar is high, and Sunsama is probably the most beautifully designed on this list. It delivers on the promise of productivity, too \u2014 Sunsama is all about mindful planning and being realistic about what you can actually achieve in a day. It\u2019s excellent for lovers of time blocking who tend to overestimate what they can get done. It encourages you to set estimated times for each task as part of a really lovely daily planning ritual, and lets you know when you have too much planned for the day. It also has a lightweight stats and analytics feature so you can see where you spent your time, which I love. The only downside to this app is the cost \u2014 it comes in at $20 per month, $16 if paid annually, but can you really put a price on productivity? Probably. My favorite features: Guided daily and weekly planning routines Simple analytics to help you better manage your time Solid list of integrations to consolidate tasks from elsewhere Cost: $20 per month, $16 if paid annually P.S. If you\u2019re looking for a similar tool on a budget, Ellie deserves an honorable mention here! Ellie was built by an independent developer, it\u2019s really nice to look at, and works in a similar way. Brain.fm Best productivity tool for getting into deep focus mode screenshot of productivity tool brain.fm When I need to get into deep work mode, brain.fm is my first port of call. It\u2019s a music app, but not in the way you think \u2014 brain.fm uses science-backed audio that\u2019s specifically designed to help you focus, relax, or sleep. According to their site, brainwaves operate at different speeds (Hz) that scientists generally break down int",

      "content_text": "Looking to get into influencer marketing for the first time? It's become a core marketing channel for many brands \u2014 and for good reason: It helps your brand appear more authentic and relatable. It gives you access to creators' engaged audiences in your niche. It's accessible to businesses at any budget. That's why 69% of brands increased their influencer marketing budgets this year. As consumers are increasingly skeptical of traditional brand-led advertising, influencer marketing offers something different: authentic recommendations from trusted voices. \"We trust reviews and other peoples' opinions more than a brand,\" explains Amanjit Heer , founder of social media marketing and influencer agency We Heer You. But as Ryan Prior , Head of Marketing at Modash, an influencer marketing platform, points out, authenticity becomes even more crucial as influencer marketing grows: \"We have dozens of influencer endorsements in our newsfeeds every day. Many of them are not authentic, which makes us (consumers) more skeptical and harder to 'influence.'\" So it's important to build genuine partnerships with creators who truly believe in your brand. As Ryan notes, \"Truly authentic partnerships are much harder to build, and so are less common, and more effective.\" Creating these authentic partnerships might sound challenging if you're new to influencer marketing. But don\u2019t be intimidated \u2014 when I started managing partnerships for e-commerce brands, it was a learning process. Trust me: you'll figure it out along the way! Plus you have this handy guide. Where we\u2019ll walk you through creating a successful influencer marketing strategy step by step, whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your existing program. What is influencer marketing? Influencer marketing is a strategy brands use to promote themselves by collaborating with content creators who have engaged, loyal audiences. In return, brands pay influencers a flat fee, sales commission, gifted products, or a combination of these. For example, if you\u2019re a fashion brand, you might collaborate with an influencer who creates content around outfit inspiration, like All Saints has done with Lois Sterling . View this post on Instagram A post shared by LOIS STERLING (@_loissterling) Influencers come with built-in social proof \u2014 when you form a partnership with creators, you borrow the trust they\u2019ve built with their audience for years. That stamp of approval is priceless to gain the reputation of a reliable brand among your potential customers. But here's the key: an influencer isn't just someone with a large following. It's someone who has genuine influence over their audience's purchasing decisions \u2014 their followers trust their recommendations and turn to them for advice. So, some superfans of gaming YouTuber Ninja might buy a skincare product he mentions, but most of his audience probably won't. So you're not making the most of the exposure to his 24 million fans. You're better off partnering with a beauty influencer who regularly shares details about their skincare routine with a modest but highly engaged following. Take Lauren Mae , for example. Although she has \u2018only\u2019 37K followers on Instagram, her followers trust her reviews and are confident in her recommendations. Source: @laurenmaebeauty_ The lesson here? Popularity doesn't always translate to influence. That's great news for brands on a budget \u2014 no need to pay hefty celebrity fees to see results from influencer marketing. Multiple studies have proven the power of influencer marketing: 64% of consumers buy based on an influencer's recommendation at least some of the time, according to impact.com. 63% of marketers say influencer-generated content performs better than brand-directed content, according to Aspire. Influencer posts are the number one way to get consumers to try new products, according to IZEA. Source: IZEA Influencer marketing is worth the hype that surrounds it. But getting the best results is no walk in the park. To harness its benefits, create a well-thought-out influencer marketing strategy and find the right influencers that will help you reach and connect with your audience. Andreea Moise , founder of Hype Maven influencer marketing agency, says, \"Many brands keep influencer marketing in a silo or blindly follow tried and tested frameworks without adapting them.\" So as you develop your strategy, remember that a cookie-cutter plan won't work. Instead, customize it to your target audience, budget, and goals. Step 1. Get clear on your influencer marketing goals Before starting your first influencer partnership, define what success looks like for your brand. Your goals will guide everything from the type of influencers you work with to how you structure your campaigns. Consider these popular influencer marketing goals To build a strong foundation, align your goals with your overall marketing strategy and business objectives. If growing revenue is mission-critical, your influencer marketing campaigns should be geared toward that, too. Some common goals you could choose for your influencer campaigns include: Brand awareness and reach : Introduce your brand to new audiences and get your products in front of more potential customers Engagement : Build brand affinity with potential customers Social proof and credibility : Build trust by showing real people using and loving your products Content creation : Get high-quality photos and videos of your products in action that you can repurpose in other marketing Sales : Drive traffic to your website and generate leads or purchases Though, as Andreea explains, \"All brands have growth as the ultimate goal.\" So whatever goals you choose, tie it back to how your goal ultimately supports a sustainable business. Andreea recommends balancing your awareness and conversion goals at a 60-40 ratio. But there's no hard-and-fast rule about it. You might balance your goals across multiple marketing channels. \ud83d\udcda Learn more : 9 Social Media Goals You Can Set for Your Business (and How to Track Them) Set measurable influencer marketing KPIs Once you've identified your goals, decide what metrics you'll measure to track your influencer program's impact. These are your key performance indicators (KPIs). For example: If your goal is to increase brand awareness, consider tracking: Reach Impressions New follower growth If your goal is engagement, consider: Likes, comments, and shares on sponsored content Saves and bookmarks Interactions and replies on stories If your goal is sales, measure: Referral traffic from influencers Conversion rate from influencer traffic Revenue generated through affiliate links or discount codes Turn these into specific, measurable goals. For example, suppose you\u2019re aiming to grow sales by achieving a certain amount of revenue per campaign. In that case, your influencer marketing KPI can be something like: \u201cAchieve $1K in revenue per campaign by the end of June.\u201d \ud83d\udca1 Pro tip: Don't try to optimize for everything at once. Pick 2 \u2013 3 primary metrics that align with your main goal. This helps you stay focused and makes it easier to measure success. Step 2. Clarify your budget Your budget will influence the types of influencer partnerships you can pursue. But don't worry if you're working with limited funds \u2014 there are influencer marketing opportunities for every budget. Factor in total program costs Start by figuring out how much money you have to work with. Remember to factor in these costs beyond creator compensation: Product costs (including shipping) for gifting Optional software tools for finding and managing influencers Additional promotion, like boosting top-performing influencer content Get creative to maximize your influencer marketing budget Working with a tight budget? Try these tips from Ryan to get the most out of the funds you've got: Remove any \"extras\" like exclusivity or usage rights from your deals Be flexible on timelines, working around the creator's other priorities Negotiate on scope (for example, a simpler or shorter video that's easier to create) Be upfront about your max budget and ask what's possible within that range You can also consider working with micro-influencers (creators with smaller, highly engaged audiences) who often charge less than bigger names while potentially delivering better results. (We'll talk more about choosing the right size influencer in step 5.) Step 3. Pick your partnership types Now, figure out the best path toward accomplishing your goals by considering how you might collaborate with creators. For example, if your influencer marketing KPI is to boost sales by 25% for a new product launch in three months, your action plan might be to find affiliate partners who can encourage sales. The type of collaboration you choose should align with: Your goals Your budget How much control you want over the content How much time you have to manage relationships Whether you want one-off posts or ongoing partnerships Ryan recommends starting with gifting and affiliate partnerships if you're on a tight budget. Both are lower risk financially. Here are some of the most common types of influencer partnerships and what they're best for, starting with the most affordable. Pro tip: You don't have to stick to just one type. Many successful brands start with gifting or affiliate partnerships to test relationships, then move into paid sponsorships with creators who perform well. Product seeding Influencer gifting (sending free products to creators) is a great way to get started on a low budget. Ideally, you'll get organic mentions or honest reviews in return. This no-strings-attached approach builds goodwill but won't guarantee a brand mention. Product seeding works for: Spreading brand awareness Getting authentic product reviews Working with many creators on a small budget Testing the waters before committing to paid partnerships For an upcoming book launch, Faber Books gifted an early copy to book-loving creator Jess .

      "content_text": "I hit 20,000 followers on LinkedIn in August 2025. The number itself is worth celebrating. After all, who doesn\u2019t love a milestone number? However, it has also led to much reflection about where and why I started on the platform. This was the first year I set a clear growth goal for LinkedIn, and reaching it gave me a reason to pause and ask: What actually drove this growth? What changed along the way? And what comes next? In this article, I\u2019ll share the strategies that fueled my growth, the opportunities that came with hitting 20K, and the challenges I\u2019ve had to navigate along the way. I\u2019ll also share how I plan to approach LinkedIn (and content more broadly) in this next phase. Let\u2019s get into it. Hitting 20,000 followers wasn\u2019t the plan (at first) When I first started actively posting on LinkedIn, numbers were the last thing on my mind. At first, I was looking for community after losing my job in 2020. Once I found work again, my focus shifted. I went back to using LinkedIn to connect with other professionals and learn from people in the content marketing space. But I was more focused on work and community than content. I only shared about 10 LinkedIn posts between 2020 and 2022. However, in 2022, after joining Buffer, posting took on a new purpose. My profile became a proof-of-concept lab, and every piece of advice I wrote for Buffer (like finding your niche or setting content pillars ), I tested on my own account first. If it worked for me, I knew it would resonate with our readers. Some of those experiments worked better than I expected. They helped me define my niche, connect with the right audience, and build a platform that unlocked opportunities I couldn\u2019t have imagined back in 2020. Reaching 20K wasn\u2019t on my radar then. It wasn\u2019t until early 2025, after crossing 15K, that I set a clear goal: prove that Buffer\u2019s strategies really work by applying them myself. I thought hitting 20K would validate the advice we share and maybe even open the door to brand partnerships \u2014 which it did, sooner than I expected. My follower count in January 2025 Still, I\u2019ve never seen followers as the only measure of success. On LinkedIn, growth looks like thoughtful comments, people referencing my work in their own posts, and conversations that carry beyond a single update. The milestone matters, but those signals matter more. What actually drove my growth The one habit that\u2019s constantly reaped rewards throughout my LinkedIn journey is consistency . Not exciting, but very true. Setting up a sustainable posting cadence has always been at the foundation of my LinkedIn strategy, and it\u2019s a tactic that Buffer\u2019s data on consistency backs up again and again. Beyond showing up, growth came from experimenting . I tested everything I was writing about at Buffer on my own account: finding a niche, choosing content pillars, and then narrowing into that \u201cVenn diagram middle\u201d where what I enjoyed overlapped with what my audience needed. That overlap became my content sweet spot. Defining my audience made all the difference. Over time, it became clear that I was speaking to early to mid-career professionals who wanted to build international careers in marketing and creative industries. Once I leaned into that, my content started connecting in a more intentional way. Sharing more personal reflections also helped; those posts often traveled further than I expected. And from 2020 to 2025, my growth has looked roughly like this: From 0 to 10K : five or six years between landing my first remote job and joining Buffer in 2022. 10K to 15K : a much faster two years. 15K to 20K : the fastest milestone at nine months, built on the foundation of all the lessons I had learned Outside of my own actions, there were external turning points too. Creator Camp was a big one \u2014 the first time I committed to a clear posting cadence (seven days straight at the start). It\u2019s proof that intentionality compounds. Once I knew what worked and who I was speaking to, my growth accelerated. What growth unlocked for me Building an audience has directly shaped my career. At the start of 2025, I started landing brand partnerships \u2014 something I never would\u2019ve thought possible back when I was posting out of necessity. That only happened because I committed to LinkedIn, set a goal, and showed up consistently. Now, partnerships feel like an option I can choose to tap into, not just a lucky break I can\u2019t control the flow of. Beyond partnerships, visibility changed how people see me in the industry. I\u2019ve been invited onto podcasts, YouTube channels, and into articles as a contributor. The recognition has been validating, but more importantly, it\u2019s helped me reach the people I care about most: early to mid-career professionals trying to build international careers. What I didn\u2019t expect about hitting 20K All this probably sounds great \u2014 consistent growth, brand partnerships, new opportunities. And it is. But if I\u2019m honest, I also feel weird about it. Here\u2019s why. LinkedIn feels narrower at scale. Unlike other platforms, people come here with specific goals: finding jobs, building networks, or learning something tied to their careers. That means my content has to fit those lanes to perform. I didn\u2019t expect growth to feel constraining, but it does. Balance gets harder, not easier. Too much lifestyle content risks credibility. Too much \u201cadvice\u201d risks sounding generic. I\u2019ve gone too far in both directions before \u2014 posts that are so polished that they feel sterile, and others so personal or \u201cout there\u201d that they confuse my audience. The sweet spot is where personal reflections connect back to professional lessons. But the bigger the audience, the harder I\u2019ve found it to hold that middle ground. Visibility creates pressure. With 200 followers, I could post freely. At 20K, every draft feels heavier. I catch myself over-editing or shelving ideas entirely. Ironically, the experimentation that fueled my growth is harder to hold onto now. That\u2019s been the most unexpected part of hitting this milestone. I\u2019m not just a professional. This has been the hardest part to articulate. My life encompasses much more than my work, but on LinkedIn, every part of me has to come through the professional lens. That filter keeps my content relevant, but it also flattens me and my personal brand. So yes, visibility is a privilege. But it\u2019s also a responsibility and one I\u2019m still figuring out how to carry without losing the curiosity and trial-and-error spirit that got me here in the first place. What\u2019s next Hitting 20K should feel like a finish line. Instead, it feels like the starting line for something new. For years, my goal on LinkedIn was clear \u2014 build a platform I could use for Buffer experiments, connect with our audience, and prove that the strategies we recommended actually worked. I\u2019ve done that. Now the question is: what comes next? I\u2019m not leaving LinkedIn. People rely on my content there, and I still enjoy the process of testing ideas and sharing lessons. But I am ready for a new phase \u2014 one where the focus shifts from proving the system to experimenting more freely. For the moment, I\u2019ve decided that that will mean loosening up on LinkedIn itself, and moving into new spaces where the stakes feel lower and I have a bit more freedom. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kicking things off with a new challenge: growing to 1,000 followers on Threads. It\u2019s the first experiment in Proof of Concept , a new series where I\u2019ll share what happens when I test different growth strategies across platforms and formats. View on Threads Threads is the perfect place to start because the playbook is still being written. In a past 30-day experiment , I learned that open-ended questions, timely replies, and joining conversations were far more effective than polished one-off posts. This time, I\u2019ll be layering those lessons with strategies we've identified , like: Using tags to reach specific communities. Posting multiple times a day (instead of four times a week, like I do on LinkedIn). Sharing a mix of text-first posts with the occasional photo to stay true to the platform\u2019s vibe. So while 20K on LinkedIn is a milestone, it\u2019s just the start of my journey as a creator. It\u2019s the point where I get to ask: what else is possible when I treat content as an experiment again?

      "content_text": "I run a Facebook group called Freelancers Who Work Smart, Not Hard , but, for ages, I managed it the hard way, not the smart way. The hard way looks like this: trying to remember to post regularly (when I sometimes can\u2019t even remember what day of the week it is), coming up with some of my best ideas at 3 a.m. (before promptly falling asleep and forgetting them), and posting sporadically with neither consistency nor strategy. Days or even weeks (eek) would go by without me posting, and the group would lose momentum. Somewhat ironically, things changed when I went on maternity leave. Before taking three months off work, I scheduled two posts a week to keep the group active while I was dealing with diapers. In doing this, the group ended up becoming more active than it\u2019s ever been! So in the interest of working smarter, not harder \u2014 whether you run a Facebook Page or Facebook Group \u2014 let me walk you through how you might be able to set up a similar process. In this guide, I\u2019ll cover the main advantages of scheduling Facebook posts and explain exactly how to schedule posts on Facebook to improve your posting consistency and content performance. Jump to a section: 5 benefits of scheduling Facebook posts How to schedule a post on Facebook using Buffer How to schedule a post on Facebook on the app How to schedule a post on Facebook using Meta Business Suite How to edit or delete a scheduled Facebook post 5 quick tips for scheduling Facebook posts More Facebook resources 5 benefits of scheduling Facebook posts Whether you\u2019re trying to increase brand awareness, grow your audience, build community, or generate leads (or all four!), there are many benefits to scheduling your Facebook posts in advance. 1. Maintain consistency Where content is king, consistent content is the trusted advisor the king can\u2019t live without. It\u2019s simple: When you post regularly, your audience knows what to expect and when to expect it. And you stay top of mind so they don\u2019t forget who you are and what you do. The numbers back this up. Buffer\u2019s data scientist, Julian Winterhiemer, analyzed engagement across all platforms Buffer supports \u2014 Instagram , Facebook , TikTok , LinkedIn , Bluesky , Threads , X , YouTube , Mastodon , and Pinterest . And, guess what? The most consistent posters received 5 times more engagement per post than users who posted inconsistently. From my own small and less impressive dataset, I can definitively say that scheduling = consistency. Check out my stats below. I was on maternity leave (with scheduled posts) from May 1st to July 31st. There\u2019s clearly a lot more activity happening in the former half of the chart compared to when I relied on my ad-hoc posting (after August 1st). So scientifically and anecdotally, scheduling posts consistently is your secret weapon for building an engaged, loyal audience. 2. Create higher-quality content The beauty of scheduling your posts is that it gives you the gift of time. Instead of scrambling to come up with something on the fly, you can plan ahead and make sure each post is thoughtfully crafted and not just checking the box of, \u201cOh heck, I need to post something before people think I\u2019ve disappeared.\u201d (Yes, I am speaking from personal experience.) Scheduling forces you to slow down and focus on quality, rather than rushing through a post at the last minute just because you need to get something out there. When you take the time to consider your content carefully, it shows. Your posts will be more intentional, more aligned with your goals, and ultimately more effective at connecting with your audience. Plus, you\u2019ve got a buffer (no pun intended) to refine things before hitting \u2018publish.\u2019 3. Be more efficient and save time I\u2019ve touched on this above, but time is your most valuable resource. And posting on Facebook can take a lot of it, especially if you\u2019re creating your posts one by one on the day you plan to share them. Then there\u2019s the fact that constantly switching between tasks isn\u2019t just inefficient; it\u2019s a brain-drainer too. Did you know multitasking makes you slower, less accurate, and more mentally drained? I certainly don\u2019t need that in my life, and I doubt you do either. When you schedule your posts ahead of time, you can batch your work, reducing the mental load of having to post on the fly and breaking your flow. By setting aside an hour or two to plan your content for the week, you\u2019ll save time , preserve your focus, and ensure that each post is on point. Efficiency for the win! As I mentioned earlier, I created my content in batches before I went on maternity leave, which made the task more manageable. So much so, that it\u2019s the most consistent I\u2019ve ever been, despite being away from my desk. 4. Optimize reach by posting at the best time for your audience Part of your content strategy involves figuring out the best time to post on Facebook for maximum engagement. Julian was kind enough to dig into the data here on this, too. He pored over the performance of more than 1 million Facebook posts sent via Buffer by businesses, creators, and influencers to pinpoint the best time to post on Facebook, the best day to post on Facebook, plus the best-performing content on Facebook. According to Buffer data, the best time to post on Facebook is 5 a.m. on Monday . Note that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean this is when audiences are up and consuming your content \u2014 it\u2019s likely that posts need some time to gain momentum on the feed. Regardless, it means the best-performing posts were shared at that time. If that isn\u2019t a great reason to schedule your Facebook content, I don\u2019t know what else is! \u23f0 Learn more about figuring out the best time to post on social media for maximum engagement. Here\u2019s a crucial caveat: There\u2019s no universally optimal time to post, as it will also depend on your business and its circumstances . The best time to post on Facebook \u2014 or any social media platform \u2014 always depends on your audience. In my group, for example, I\u2019m reaching two primary time zones: SAST and CAT, so I need to find a time that works for both. I aim to hit the South African audience at lunchtime, and the US audience first thing in the morning as they start their day. 5. Better content planning and control I know that random posting can feel a bit like throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. But when you schedule posts, you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. You can plan strategically, making sure your content is spaced out in a way that keeps things fresh and engaging. This also allows you to plan for time-sensitive content, ensuring it goes out when it\u2019s most relevant. It\u2019s also much easier to maintain a consistent voice and style when you\u2019re in control of your posting schedule. Instead of lashing out with something spicy and off-brand because you\u2019ve had a bad day, planning and scheduling ahead gets you in the flow of creating thoughtful, on-brand content that reflects your values and resonates with your audience. For me, scheduling Facebook posts provides peace of mind that everything\u2019s taken care of, leaving me with more brain space to a) do my real job, and b) focus on creating even more awesome content. Now that we've covered the \u2018why\u2019 of Facebook scheduling, let\u2019s dive into the \u2018how:\u2019 How to schedule a post on Facebook using Buffer Let's start with the most feature-rich scheduling route, a social media management tool like Buffer. Here\u2019s how to schedule using Buffer in four simple steps: Go to your Buffer dashboard. Select your Facebook Page or group. Craft your Facebook post. Schedule your post. 1. Go to your Buffer dashboard Once you\u2019ve signed up for Buffer and connected your Facebook account, you\u2019ll see your Buffer dashboard: 2. Select your Facebook Page or group Select the Facebook Page or profile you want to post to, in the left-side column. Click on the '+ New' create post button on the top right-hand side of your screen, then choose 'Post.' 3. Create your Facebook post A popup where you can craft your post will appear. (You can also add any other channels you have connected to crosspost your content elsewhere.) Use an idea you\u2019ve generated or create from scratch. Choose 'Post,' 'Reel, or 'Story,' depending on what content you want to post. Upload your media and add your caption. \ud83d\udca1 Never lose a lightbulb-moment content idea again! Here\u2019s a system for capturing your ideas and using them to create content. 4. Schedule your post Once you\u2019ve crafted your post, you have a few scheduling options: Add to Queue (default) : Add the post to the next available posting time on your posting schedule. Schedule Posts : Schedule the post for a specific date and time. Share Now: Share the post immediately. Share Next: If you are on one of our paid plans, you can add the post to the top of your queue and have it published next. \ud83d\udccc Quick tips: To auto-publish your post at a specific time, make sure the 'Automatic' option is selected. To schedule Facebook Group posts, you\u2019ll need to choose 'Notify Me\u2019 to get a notification when the time comes to post. \ud83d\udcd8 Learn more about scheduling Facebook Group posts using mobile notifications. Will using scheduling tools affect my engagement? No, using scheduling tools will not negatively impact your engagement . In fact, consistency \u2014 something scheduling tools help you maintain \u2014 can improve your reach and engagement. Research has shown that posts scheduled via third-party tools may even achieve higher engagement compared to posts published natively. While scheduling posts doesn't guarantee success on its own, it ensures that your content goes out at optimal times and frees up time for you to focus on creating and interacting with your audience. Engagement drops when users neglect to respond to comments or focus on posting frequently without considering content quality. The bottom line is that with good content, proper timing, and active engagement, using scheduling tools can be a great way to enhance your social media presence.

      "content_text": "At Buffer, we are always looking for ways to help our team work more effectively and creatively. Our latest investment in productivity is a company-wide AI Tools Stipend of $250 per teammate per year. This initiative reinforces our ongoing commitment to supporting innovation while giving our teammates the autonomy to choose tools that best fit their individual workflows. Here's why we're introducing this stipend and how we expect it to impact our work. The evolution of AI in our workflows Over the past year, we've seen AI tools rapidly transform how many of us work. What started as occasional experimentation with tools like ChatGPT has evolved into more regular integration of AI assistants in various aspects of our workflow \u2014 from drafting content and generating ideas to debugging code and analyzing data. Late last year, our Engineering Managers began exploring the idea of offering a stipend specifically for Engineers to experiment with productivity-boosting AI software. We noticed some inconsistencies in reimbursement requests for these tools and aligned on providing structured support for this exploration. The positive impact on our engineering team made it clear that AI tools could benefit everyone at Buffer, regardless of their role. That's why we've decided to extend this stipend to all teammates. Why we're introducing an AI tools stipend The pace of AI tool development has accelerated dramatically, and we want to empower our team to experiment and find what works best for their specific needs. There are a few key reasons behind this decision: Autonomy and flexibility : Different roles benefit from different AI tools, and we want teammates to have the freedom to choose what works for them rather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all solution. Reducing friction : By providing a dedicated stipend, we remove financial barriers to trying new tools that might significantly improve productivity. Learning together : As we all explore different AI tools, we can share insights and recommendations, collectively building our understanding of how these technologies can best support our work. Staying ahead of the curve : AI technology is evolving rapidly, and we want to ensure our team has access to cutting-edge tools that help us continue delivering exceptional service to our customers. How our AI stipend works We've allocated $250 per teammate per year for AI tools. With our current team size of 71 people, this represents a potential additional operating expense of up to $17,750 annually. The stipend offers flexibility, allowing teammates to maintain a yearly subscription to one primary tool, access others occasionally for specific projects, or mix and match several tools throughout the year. We've designed the AI Tools Stipend to be straightforward and flexible: Eligibility : All Buffer teammates are eligible to use the full $250 stipend annually. Covered tools : The stipend covers AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, Cursor, Cody, Spiral, Raycast, and similar tools that enhance productivity and creativity. Subscription recommendation : We suggest opting for monthly subscriptions rather than annual commitments to maintain flexibility in trying different tools. Free alternatives : Many AI tools offer free versions, so we recommend exploring those first before committing to a paid plan. Additionally, Gemini Advanced is already available through our Google Workspace. Knowledge sharing : In the spirit of transparency, teammates who use the stipend are encouraged to share the tool they're exploring in our #culture-ai Slack channel so we can all learn together. Learning together: building an AI knowledge base One of the most exciting aspects of this program is the opportunity to collectively discover and share best practices for using AI tools. By encouraging discussion in our #culture-ai Slack channel, we hope to: Create a repository of real-world use cases specific to Buffer's work Help teammates discover tools that might benefit their particular workflow Identify patterns in how different teams are leveraging AI We already have some early success stories: Content Team: Experimenting with AI for research and ideation while maintaining our unique voice. The stipend is already having an impact here as our content writer, Tami, wrote an article detailing an experiment with five AI chatbots and how they might fit into creators\u2019 workflows. Engineering Team: Boosting productivity through AI-assisted coding. Customer Advocacy Team: Exploring ways to enhance customer interactions with AI support. Through these shared experiences, we'll continue to refine our understanding of how AI can best support our work at Buffer. Over to you This stipend is just one part of our broader approach to thoughtfully integrating AI into our work at Buffer. We see AI tools as assistants that can handle routine tasks and provide creative inspiration, freeing up our human team to focus on the work that requires genuine human connection, creativity, and strategic thinking. We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts: Do you have questions about how we're approaching AI adoption at Buffer? Are you using AI tools in your work? Which ones have you found most valuable? As always, we're learning as we go \u2014 we believe in the potential of AI to enhance our work while still keeping human creativity, connection, and judgment at the center of what we do.

      "content_text": "There are no definitive \u201cgrowth hacks\u201d for increasing your Instagram followers \u2014 but don't worry, there are still plenty of\u00a0practical things you can do to build a solid growth strategy that actually works. Here are 14 steps you can take for organic Instagram growth in the order we recommend doing them. Before we dive in: If you\u2019re just starting with Instagram for your business or as a creator, the first step is to tighten the nuts and bolts of your Instagram presence. The first few tips in this guide cover the basics and are especially helpful if you're just starting out as a creator or business. Even if you\u2019re a seasoned Instagrammer, it\u2019s worth double-checking that you\u2019ve got the fundamentals covered before moving on. If you are, don't worry: there's plenty of guidance in this guide for intermediate and advanced creators, too. We know it's tempting to buy fake followers for a quick boost, but it'll actually work against you in the long run. These tips will be a far better use of your time \u2014 and will be well worth the effort. Let's get into them all. Overview: 14 ways to get more Instagram followers 1. Add keywords to your username and name 2. Optimize your Instagram bio 3. Cross-promote your Instagram handle on other channels 4. Build an Instagram marketing strategy 5. Post 3-5 times per week 6. Find your best times to post on Instagram 7. Write compelling captions 8. Use relevant hashtags and keywords 9. Understand your analytics 10. Collaborate with Instagram creators or other small businesses 11. Experiment with different types of Instagram posts 12. Talk to your audience in comments and stories 13. Avoid buying fake followers 14. Get verified on Instagram 1. Add keywords to your username and name The Instagram algorithm prioritizes search results containing keywords in the name and username. Your username is your Instagram handle (your profile\u2019s @name): Keep this the same as your company\u2019s name and/or consistent with your profile\u2019s username on other social channels to be instantly identifiable. Your name is your or your company\u2019s name (or anything you like): Add relevant keywords here that your target audience would search for to improve your visibility. For example, creator Hannah Hargrove has the keywords \u201cBaby + Toddler Nutrition\u201d on her Instagram account, right next to her name. Her username is also \u201ctinyeatersnutrition\u201d \u2014 these specifics instantly tell you what to expect from her Instagram account. Instagram users searching for \u201ctoddler nutrition\u201d will also find her account pop up in search (that\u2019s how I found her!) \u2014 helping her gain more Instagram followers. Adding relevant keywords is also an opportunity to share who you are and what you sell to new followers at a glance \u2014 since it's the first thing someone sees when they land on your profile. Just don't go overboard with keywords in your Instagram name field \u2014 it'll come across as spammy and water down their purpose. Use just a few phrases that tell people what your Instagram account is about. 2. Optimize your Instagram bio When you think of how to get more followers on Instagram, you might not think of the Instagram bio. But the bio is a crucial part of your Instagram feed \u2014 it tells other Instagram users who you are and what you do in a few sentences. There are four elements you need to nail to for the perfect Instagram bio: A straightforward description of what you do and/or what you sell A touch of brand personality A clear call to action A link Want to show up in more searches? Add one or two keywords that describe what you do right in your name field or handle \u2014 think \u201cvegan recipes\u201d or \u201cwedding photographer.\u201d Those words act like SEO for Instagram, making it easier for the right people to find you. The key to great Instagram bios is making them clear, creative, and complete. Anyone reading it should instantly know what you do or your company does, how it can help them, and where they can learn more. The skincare company, Kinship , is an excellent example of how to ace the Instagram bio. They use the right Instagram category for their account (health/beauty) to instantly establish their niche. Following this is one line about their brand mentions, another about what they sell, and the last one about their strongest features. In the end, they\u2019ve added multiple links for their Instagram followers to tap on and learn more. \u2728 Pro tip: Track which calls to action drive the most clicks on Instagram. Crafting the perfect Instagram bio involves examining different iterations to see what \u2018clicks\u2019 (pun intended) with your new followers. The link in bio is your chance to redirect your Instagram followers to an external page. You can add your company\u2019s website or keep updating it based on your recent Instagram posts. But if you want to go the extra mile, use link-in-bio tools like Buffer\u2019s Start Page to combine all your URLs into one landing page \u2014 like photographer Ryan Johnson : You can customize this Start Page using Buffer as much as you like to make it more on-brand for your Instagram followers. There are in-depth statistics about link clicks for each URL, too. 3. Cross-promote your Instagram handle on other channels Redirecting potential customers from other channels to your Instagram account is an easy way to gain more Instagram followers quickly \u2014 especially if you already have a strong presence on other social media platforms. For example, at Buffer, we have our Instagram link on our website footer. There are various ways to cross-promote to increase your follower count. Add your Instagram page\u2019s link to: Your product packaging Your blogs (when relevant) Marketing and transactional emails Your website\u2019s footer and/or sidebar Social media posts from team members Your and your employees\u2019 email signature Bios on other social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube Networking events and webinars (Use your profile\u2019s Instagram QR code for in-person events) Cross-promotion will help you increase the probability of being in front of relevant users on Instagram. Existing followers from other social media platforms likely already know you and the kind of content you create \u2014 they\u2019re quality followers; the ones who are most likely to enjoy and engage with your Instagram posts. 4. Build an Instagram strategy Having a clear idea of where Instagram fits into your overall social media marketing strategy will not only help you gain more followers, but also help you get more relevant content ideas for Instagram. But how do you create an Instagram growth strategy? Step 1: Get clear on your goals Instead of learning how to get more followers on Instagram, step back and reflect on what you plan to do with your follower count. Do you want to build a personal brand? Or raise brand awareness for your company? Perhaps you want to drive website traffic. Maybe you want to collect more user-generated content . Whatever it is, define it clearly \u2014 with measurable milestones \u2014 to put intention behind your Instagram strategy. Clarifying your goal dictates the content you post and calls to action, and keeps your Instagram feed on-brand. Step 2: Get a 360-view of your target audience Knowing the basic demographics is crucial. But also go beyond that and deeply understand what your audience struggles with and how you can help them resolve their challenges using your Instagram content strategy. This will allow you to create content that truly resonates with your community \u2014 helping you gain more Instagram followers. Natasha Pierre \u2014 creator and host of the Shine Online Podcast \u2014 says losing sight of your ideal follower in exchange for virality is the single biggest mistake creators make. \u201cPeople often focus so much on going viral and reaching as many people as possible that they lose sight of the ideal follower they're trying to reach,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could go viral today, and if you're reaching mostly the wrong people, chances are it won't result in them following you. [Even if they do], it would lead to Instagram followers who aren\u2019t engaged.\u201d \u201cTaking the time to reflect on who your ideal follower is will help you create specific-to-them content, which will not only result in better growth but quality new followers.\u201d Step 3: Define your brand voice and aesthetic Even if you\u2019re a creator and not a company, it\u2019s worth crafting a social media marketing voice that\u2019s uniquely you, so Instagram users can identify your posts without seeing the username. Brand voice is hard to track or quantify, but it\u2019s non-negotiable to be memorable. On Instagram, you can also define your aesthetic along with your brand voice. Use brand colors, stick to a consistent content theme, and have a personality. \ud83e\udde0 Remember: If you\u2019re a small business, your social media marketing voice shouldn\u2019t differ vastly from your general brand voice. Reflect your company values on and off the app. Step 4: Create content pillar themes and stick to them Decide on a niche for your Instagram account. Have a few overarching topics you\u2019ll post about, and don\u2019t deviate from them too much. This has many benefits: You don\u2019t have to constantly reinvent the wheel for brainstorming great content ideas Your Instagram community starts recognizing you for the type of content you create You don\u2019t get distracted by the new, shiny thing, and keep revising your Instagram strategy \u2728 Pro tip: Do the best ideas come to you while doing the dishes or walking the dog? Because, same. Use the Create space inside Buffer to store these thoughts whenever creativity sparks. 5. Post 3\u20135 times per week for consistent growth When it comes to growing on Instagram, frequency does matter. Buffer\u2019s data shows that posting 3\u20135 times per week is the sweet spot for reach and follower growth in 2025. We analyzed over two million Instagram posts and found that accounts posting 3\u20135 times per week: Grow their followers 2\u00d7 faster than accounts posting 1\u20132 times See 12% more reach per post on average That\u2019s a big payoff for just one or two extra posts a week.

      "content_text": "You\u2019re showing up consistently on Instagram\u2014 creating high-quality content, getting views, reaching new people. But maybe you're wondering why the likes, comments, and shares aren't quite where you'd hoped they'd be. If you\u2019re doing all that, our content itself probably isn\u2019t the issue. You just need to fine-tune your Instagram engagement strategy to better connect with your audience and build a loyal community . In this blog post, I\u2019ll share 11 evidence-backed strategies that will help you increase your engagement rate on Instagram. What is Instagram engagement? Instagram engagement is a measure of how your audience interacts with your content beyond just viewing it. Whenever your audience takes an action after seeing your post, it qualifies as an engagement. These actions can be: Liking Commenting Sharing Reposting Saving \u201cThe engagement rate on your content is more important than your follower count,\u201d says Adam Mosseri , Head of Instagram. \u201cFollowers are important, yes, but a better sign of how you\u2019re doing on Instagram is how many likes, views, and reshares your content is getting.\u201d Why does Instagram engagement matter? Engagement rate on Instagram isn\u2019t just important because Mosseri said so (although that\u2019s a pretty big deal). But also because: 1. Instagram engagement helps you understand the kind of content that resonates with your target audience. When you know what your followers like, you can replicate that content and refine your strategy. 2. The Instagram algorithm loves posts that get engagement. High engagement rate = sign that people love your post. So, the algorithm pushes it to more people. This means that when you work to increase your Instagram engagement, you create a domino effect where you also improve your reach and, by extension, gain more followers . Talk about a win-win! 3. Lastly, engagement isn't just about metrics. Social media is about building a deeper connection with your audience. Strengthening engagement is an excellent way to achieve that. \u201cA lot of creators (and brands) treat Instagram like a broadcast channel rather than a two-way street. Posting is easy to systemise. Engaging requires time, nuance, and often a willingness to step outside of your content calendar. That\u2019s why it gets deprioritised,\u201d says social media expert Annie-Mai Hodge . \u201cThe irony is that the same people who skip engagement are usually the ones frustrated when their audience doesn\u2019t rally behind their launches or projects. The benefits of engaging are very real: you build trust, you create a sense of loyalty, and you make people feel like they\u2019re part of your world, not just spectators of it.\u201d So now that we've covered why engagement matters, let's look at how to actually measure it. How to calculate your Instagram engagement rate You can measure engagement on Instagram for each post by seeing how many likes, comments, shares, reposts, and saves it has. Here are the two most common formulas you can use to measure your Instagram engagement rate. By impressions: (Total engagements \u00f7 Total impressions) \u00d7 100 By followers: (Total engagements \u00f7 Follower count) \u00d7 100 Engagements include likes, comments, shares, saves, and reposts. If you use Buffer, the analytics dashboard does the math for you. Instagram engagement rate based on impressions When you measure your engagement rate using impressions , you see insights based on how many people saw your post \u2014 regardless of whether they follow you. This method is best for Instagram Reels, where the reach extends beyond your followers. For example, if your post was seen 1,000 times (impressions) and received 30 engagements (likes, comments, shares, saves, and reposts), your engagement rate would be 3%. If you use a social media management software like Buffer to schedule your Instagram posts, it calculates the engagement rate for you. Here\u2019s how that looks in Buffer. Use the impressions-based engagement rate calculator to understand how your Instagram engagement compares to your overall visibility. That\u2019s great since Instagram is also increasingly pushing your content to non-followers. Instagram engagement rate based on follower count The engagement formula based on follower count helps you understand how your existing followers are interacting with your content. Here\u2019s the formula to measure your engagement rate this way: For example, if you have 1,000 followers and one of your posts had 70 likes, 15 comments, and five shares, your engagement rate would be 9%. Follower-based engagement rates are good for understanding whether your content is resonating with your followers. But it doesn\u2019t tell you how many of your existing followers actually saw your content \u2014 that\u2019s where an impressions-based Instagram engagement calculator would work better. Instagram engagement rate calculators There are several free Instagram engagement rate calculators online to help you understand the overall engagement of your Instagram account (rather than just a single post). But these tools often use different formulas to calculate the engagement rate. For example, Modash\u2019s free engagement rate calculator uses median likes divided by followers as its formula. But the Socialinsider Instagram engagement rate calculator takes a follower-based approach. It measures the engagement rate by calculating the sum of likes and comments divided by the number of posts in the last 30 days. Then it divides that number by the total number of followers. Whichever Instagram engagement calculator you use, remember to check the metrics they\u2019re using in their formula. This will help you understand if you\u2019re getting the insights about what you actually want to know. Most Instagram engagement rate calculators online take a follower-based approach. For more nuanced insights into your engagement rate based on impressions, rely on a tool like Buffer . Bonus: It can also help you manage your entire social media strategy in one place. What is a good engagement rate on Instagram? A \u2018good\u2019 engagement rate depends on various factors. In some industries, even 1% can be a high engagement rate \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean your content is falling flat. But the factor that has the most influence on engagement rate is the follower count. Buffer analyzed 27 million posts from 273,000 accounts to understand how engagement shifts as creators grow. The median engagement rate for the average Instagram account is 4.3%. But if you\u2019re a small account with up to 1,000 followers, the median number climbs to 5.2%. The median continues to shift as you grow a large following. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more about how the median engagement rate changes as your followers increase : What Is A Good Instagram Engagement Rate? Data from 27 Million+ Instagram Posts While the above metrics are helpful as a benchmark, don\u2019t chase numbers alone. Instead, focus on creating content that your audience finds valuable. Track your individual progress and focus on the posts that get the most interactions. How to get more engagement on Instagram: 11 ways Before we dive into the strategies, here's something to keep in mind:\u00a0 Instagram offers a lot\u00a0 of ways to engage with your audience. Wondering how to use all these features can be overwhelming. Should you engage more on stories than broadcast channels? Should you prioritize responding to comments or DMs? \u201cMix features throughout the week so you\u2019re meeting your audience at different touchpoints, whether that\u2019s stories, Broadcast Channels, Notes, or comments. Think about these features less as a checklist of engagement, and more as different layers of interaction,\u201d says Annie-Mai. \u201cStories and Notes are low-stakes and invite quick taps or replies, while comments and channels create space for deeper exchanges. Test all of them for a few months, then look closely at where your community actually invests attention. The balance should be driven by where you see the richest back-and-forth, not by trying to tick every box.\u201d That said, here are 11 tried-and-tested tips to help you increase your Instagram engagement. Let\u2019s get into it. 1. Ask specific questions in your captions as a call-to-action Asking specific questions in your Instagram captions is one of the easiest ways to increase engagement. It helps start a dialogue and encourages your audience to comment on your post. \u201cCreate engaging content that sparks a conversation. And I don\u2019t mean rage bait; I mean content that poses a question for the audience, that feels very relatable, or that touches on common pain points,\u201d says Mireia Boronat , Marketing Manager at The Social Shepherd . \u201cSuch content will always spark conversation in the comment section, as well as making the post more likely to be engaged with (liked, saved, and shared).\u201d For example, see some call-to-action prompts from fitness creator Adriana Blanc . Both of these posts entice people to interact with her content and share their own opinions or stories. Pro tip : Asking your audience if they\u2019d like a second part of a post is also an excellent way to test content ideas. Another easy way to improve your post\u2019s visibility is to add three to five relevant hashtags in each post. They help the algorithm categorize your content and boost your Instagram search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. Your call-to-action (CTA) should be relevant to the context of your Instagram post (duh). Still, it can be incredibly helpful to keep the intent of \u2018conversation\u2019 front and center in the ideation stage. 2. Respond to your audience in comments and DMs Your effort to build engagement doesn\u2019t end when you encourage your audience to comment. Instead, it begins at that moment. Your community won\u2019t be excited to comment on your posts if you don\u2019t respond to them. No one wants to talk to a wall. When you reply to comments , your followers feel heard and valued. Instagram also sees the engagement as a positive signal and continues to push your post to potential new followers. \u201cIf you could only pick one way to engage with your audience, comments ",

      "content_text": "In December 2022, I was starting to long for something more. I was working at a Venture Capital firm and was feeling the itch to create something new on my own. At the firm, I was a portfolio manager and would run point on all the firm's founder relationships. Through those relationships, I noticed a trend: founders of startups are no different than anyone else. I believe anyone can build a company as long as they have a clear vision, the market is right, they\u2019re self-aware, understand the nuances of the industry, and they have the grit to power through the roadblocks. After some time in Venture Capital, I took the knowledge I built around market research and started applying it to my personal life. I subsequently built three profitable bootstrapped online businesses in the music industry, one I successfully sold in 2021. I have historically always balanced having jobs and online businesses. I think it\u2019s important to have multiple revenue streams and ultimately be diversified, as you never know if you\u2019ll lose your job one day or if the market will change. The concept of \u201cmore\u201d has always been a brush for me. I\u2019ll typically work extremely hard at a company for some time and then want more for myself. This has ultimately led me to my next idea; Exploding Ideas.co . ExplodingIdeas.co landing page ExplodingIdeas.co is a weekly startup ideas newsletter in which I explore emerging trends and gaps in developing markets, showcasing to readers where the opportunities are and how to capitalize on them. The rise of newsletters In January 2023, I noticed an increase in reception around niche newsletters . Niche newsletter Milk Road had recently made headlines for selling to a private equity firm for over $1,000,000 after only ten months of business. Quickly thereafter, TheRundown.ai launched and quickly skyrocketed in popularity, getting on track to do $1,000,000/year after just four months of being online. This insane influx of interest was all I needed to be convinced. It was clear that not only are people interested in these niche newsletters, but those newsletters can build up substantial value in them, unmatched by similar-sized social media accounts due to the monetization opportunities . I then decided to start my own niche newsletter , ExplodingIdeas.co, and after four months, it\u2019s made thousands in profit. Here\u2019s how I did it and how you can ultimately do it too! Identifying my newsletter niche After deciding to dive head-first into building my own newsletter, I needed to figure out what trend I could take advantage of. Milk Road did well because it capitalized on crypto at peak popularity. The Rundown did the same when AI took off. Even if I didn\u2019t ride a market bubble, I still needed to find something with momentum to make sure I would easily attract people via an interest that existed in the market. Looking at the overall market sentiment in April 2023, it was clear that there was a lot of uncertainty. Tech firms were laying off workers, AI was becoming a threatening narrative for further job displacement, and the stock market was heavily correcting from rising interest rates. Whenever there is uncertainty and fear in the market, people are presented with pay cuts and potentially being laid off. As such, Maslow's hierarchy of needs becomes extremely important. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology that comprises a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. Long story short, it describes that when people are presented with the prospect of losing their income, which allows them to put food on the table, shelter over their heads, etc., it quickly becomes the only thing they can think about and consumes them. This happens every time there\u2019s a market downturn. I decided to use that sentiment as my momentum catalyst and built a newsletter to give people in-depth insights into trending online business ideas that they could capitalize on as a side hustle. This would enable those who wanted to take action to build their own online businesses with just a computer and offer a potential solution to calm their anxieties about the more significant market deterioration. I had built a couple of my own side hustles in the past and also did market research for Universal Music Publishing Group for years. Parlaying this knowledge into my own newsletter felt fitting, and the market timing felt perfect. Building the initial audience To build my audience, I identified an organic social channel to post about my newsletter and get subscribers for free. As newsletters are content businesses, and I wasn\u2019t sure how I would monetize it, I didn\u2019t want to subsidize customer acquisition via ads as I felt that would give me an unsustainable method of acquiring subscribers. In order to grow a content business with no immediate revenue model, I needed to have a free method of growth. In the past, I had built a couple of businesses off of Facebook private groups and Reddit by posting valuable content and funneling traffic to my landing pages, so I decided to take the same path with this. Facebook isn\u2019t as popular as it used to be, so I decided to focus on testing out Reddit as my organic growth channel. Looking at subreddits like r/Entrepreneur, there were many people asking for ways to come up with their own side hustles, and they were asking about how others came up with side hustles that ultimately earned them a full-time living. Speaking from experience, I decided to respond to those posts offering my advice on finding business ideas to capitalize on, and after providing the advice linked my newsletter as a resource. I went to sleep, woke up, and was shocked \u2013 people were interested! I got 50 signups while I was sleeping. I doubled down on this strategy to see how quickly I could reach 1,000 subscribers. I hit 1,000 subscribers in 12 days and spent $0 on customer acquisition costs. Statistics from Exploding Ideas' early days At this point, I felt that if I just kept doing what I was doing, I could build something big and find a way to make money by listening to the community for what features they wanted and charging for them. Turning it into a business Launching paid features was tough. I wasn\u2019t sure how people would receive the move as, up until this point, everything had been free. Despite the anxiety and fear, I decided that after three months and 5,000 subscribers, I would launch a paid plan for subscribers who wanted deep business idea insights. There would be two tiers: Tier one was freemium. It entitled subscribers to high-level business idea research every Sunday. Tier two included the Sunday business idea research and the new Tuesday Deep Dive. The Tuesday Deep Dive shares the SEO opportunities, Google Trends data, business ideas, and case studies for successful people already pursuing the idea and how to replicate it yourself. I decided to launch tier two because the community of subscribers was emailing me asking me for more insights so they could act on the ideas I was sending out. On the day of the launch, I got about eight signups which wasn\u2019t thrilling but new subscribers started coming in every day, which was encouraging. It was apparent that I needed to take a longer view for onboarding paid subscribers, and it\u2019s been growing a ton since then. An interesting learning I had from that was immediately readers started emailing me asking for other features. Some readers wanted to speak on the phone with me to get my thoughts on their ideas as consultations, other readers turned out to be businesses, and they wanted to sponsor the newsletter with an advertisement. I decided to roll out both as new features. I allowed companies to sponsor the newsletter every week, and I gave individuals the ability to have one-on-one meetings with me to go over their ideas and develop strategies. These two additional revenue streams immediately moved the needle for the business. I had my first consulting gig within three days and my first newsletter sponsorship in the first week I launched it. Making the newsletter profitable and sustainable Acquiring subscribers for free via Reddit made it very easy to get profitable early. I spent about $1,200 initially for an email service provider subscription (for a one-year subscription), a domain name, and a MidJourney subscription (to make the logo). Since I kept the costs in the beginning super low, it forced me to be a scrappy entrepreneur and bootstrap the business. I had to develop the logo idea myself, art, fonts, etc., and do everything as cheaply as possible since I funded this out of my own pocket. I got to profitability in the first couple of weeks of turning on monetization. Getting these subscribers for free via Reddit made them visit my website and sign up independently. I didn\u2019t retarget them with ads; this was completely organic . Therefore my open rates and engagement rates have been high. I always include polls in my emails, and this was the result of one of my first newsletter articles: Working on engagement and retention The significance of user engagement and retention in the newsletter business cannot be overstated. A newsletter is only as good as its readership, and maintaining high open rates and click-through rates is critical for its success. To keep subscribers engaged, I sent out weekly polls and interactive content. The readers loved this approach as it gave them a sense of involvement and community. It also gave me helpful feedback and insight into what content and topics resonated the most with my audience. To reduce churn, I regularly monitored email open rates and click-through rates. If a subscriber hadn't opened an email in a while, I'd send them a personalized email asking if there was anything more they'd like to see from Explodingideas.co. This level of personal touch worked wonders for retention and often sparked new content ideas. Advice for aspiring newsletter operators One of the greatest mom",

      "content_text": "X (formerly Twitter) moves fast . If you\u2019ve ever opened the app only to have the tweet you\u2019re reading refresh before you finish, you know what that looks like. From breaking news and personal updates to memes and product launches \u2014 and everything in between \u2014 there are nearly 500 million tweets posted to the social media platform every day. And with the option to share text posts, threads, videos, photos, and links, brands and creators have plenty of ways to show up, share ideas, and stay part of an active community. But showing up consistently takes planning, especially when you consider that the X/Twitter algorithm loves fresh content and rewards accounts that post regularly. Scheduling your tweets helps with that. It lets you create your best content when it works for you, then automatically publish it when your audience is online and scrolling. You get to stay visible and consistent without being glued to your phone all day. That's a win-win! Let's look at how to schedule tweets, why it\u2019s worth doing, and explore a few best practices for scheduling Twitter posts. Jump to a section: How to schedule tweets on X/Twitter How to schedule tweets with Buffer How to schedule tweets on mobile How to schedule tweet threads How to delete scheduled tweets How to schedule a quote tweet How long can scheduled tweets be?

Next, choose the date and time you\u2019d like to schedule your tweet to post. 5. Click Confirm , then click Schedule . Your tweet will now be posted at the scheduled date and time.

To schedule tweets directly through X on mobile, you\u2019d need to log in to x.com through your browser and use the same steps as on desktop. It works, but it\u2019s not the most convenient option. An easier way to schedule tweets on a mobile device is to use an X/Twitter scheduling tool like Buffer. You can draft your post and set it to go live at a scheduled date and time from your phone without needing to use the browser. It\u2019s designed to work on mobile, so the whole process feels easier from the start. Here\u2019s how to schedule tweets from the Buffer app. First, you\u2019ll need a Buffer account. You can sign up for Buffer for free and connect your X right away from the desktop, or wait and do it later from the mobile app. Next, download the Buffer app for iOS or Buffer's Android app If you haven\u2019t connected your X account yet, select + Add a new Channel and follow the steps to link it.

You\u2019ll see a checkbox next to each scheduled tweet. Select the ones you want to remove, then click Delete in the bottom right. A confirmation screen will pop up. Just click Delete one more time to finish. The scheduled post is now deleted and won\u2019t be published.

Tap Delete again, and you\u2019re all set. How to schedule a quote tweet Simple tweet scheduling is not all you can do. And sometimes, scheduling a quote tweet makes more sense than posting it right away. Maybe someone tagged your brand in a great testimonial, and you\u2019d like to reshare it at a time when more people might see it. Or maybe you tweeted about an upcoming event or launch, and want to retweet it with a fresh message a few days later as a reminder before it goes live. Scheduling takes the pressure off having to remember in the moment. Schedule a quote tweet from X/Twitter Scheduling a quote tweet on X works the same way as scheduling a regular tweet. Tap the repost icon on the original tweet, choose Quote , and write your message. When you\u2019re done, click the schedule icon to pick a date and time, and then take it from there.

The option won\u2019t appear in the X/Twitter mobile app. Schedule a quote tweet from Buffer Start by pasting the link to the original tweet into the Buffer composer. Then, write your message before the link, the same way you would on X Once you\u2019re happy with how it looks, click Schedule Post to add it to your calendar. \u26a1 Now you know how to schedule tweets, learn how to schedule postson your other social media platforms.

This applies whether you\u2019re using a free account or have a premium subscription. If you\u2019re on X Premium and want to schedule a longer post \u2014 up to the full 25,000 characters \u2014 you can use a scheduling tool like Buffer, which supports posting and scheduling them. And if you have a free Twitter account but still want to share something longer, you\u2019ve got options too. You can split your post into a thread and use Buffer to schedule it. Why should you schedule tweets? Why schedule tweets when you can post them on the fly? Well, scheduling your tweets is one of those small changes that can make a big difference in the way you manage social media. When you schedule your tweets ahead of time, you take the pressure off having to post in the moment and open up some great benefits for your Twitter account. Stay consistent with your posting schedule: Planning ahead makes it easier to keep showing up on social media. You can map out your content in advance and schedule tweets to go live when you want them to without needing to be online at all times. Reach your audience at the right time: Your followers aren\u2019t all scrolling at the same time, especially when they\u2019re in different time zones. Scheduling lets you share your posts when your audience is most active so your message has a better chance of being seen. Save time with batch creation: Scheduling lets you plan and write multiple tweets in one go, so you\u2019re not stuck coming up with content every day. You can set aside time to prep a week or even an entire months\u2019 worth of posts, schedule them all at once, and then shift your focus to engaging with your audience or creating content for other platforms. Make space to focus on quality: When you schedule tweets, you have more time to write thoughtful posts, build out campaign content, and align your tweets with other marketing efforts \u2014 all without rushing. 4 best practices for scheduling tweets Ready to give scheduling your tweets a spin?

But the sheer volume of metrics can be a little overwhelming when you start digging into the data \u2014 pinpointing the ones that matter for your brand and business isn\u2019t always easy. That\u2019s where this article comes in. In it, I\u2019ll walk you through what are widely considered the key metrics to track when it comes to measuring your content marketing ROI (return on investment) , KPIs (key performance indicators), and all the other acronyms business leaders love. Then, to add a little nuance to the discussion, we\u2019ll deep dive into the metrics that matter the most to several top content marketing teams (including Buffer\u2019s). Ready to dig in? Again, I promise you won\u2019t have to do any math \u2014 word nerd\u2019s honor. 1. Website traffic It\u2019s little wonder almost all of the content experts I spoke to mentioned website traffic . This metric indicates how much traffic was generated (how many times your site was visited). Different content marketing analytics tools will have slightly different naming conventions for the important metrics that fall under this bucket. The ones I\u2019ve seen used most often to track content performance are: Page views This is usually the biggest traffic number \u2014 the number of times a landing page or blog post on your site has been viewed. It\u2019s important to note that this tracks multiple visits from the same person. For example, if one person visits the page ten times, ten page views will be recorded. (Side note: thanks for reading this again, mom!) Users Users, or unique visitors, show how many people visit your website. Multiple visits by the same person are only counted once. So even though my mom has read this article 10 times, she\u2019s only counted once. 2. Organic search traffic Organic search traffic refers to how many page views are generated by non-paid search results. This number effectively ties into website traffic, but content marketing teams will often make this distinction if: a) They\u2019re using paid search ads on Google and the like to reach new members of their target audience b) Search engine optimization (SEO) is an integral part of their content marketing strategy , and they\u2019re aiming to climb the search engine results page (SERPs). 3. Keyword rankings Again, if SEO is important to a content team, they\u2019ll likely pay close attention to their keyword rankings \u2014 in other words, the website page\u2019s position in search results that are important to their product or service. For example, terms like \u2018 social media management tool \u2019 and \u2018 social media analytics \u2019 are essential to us at Buffer since that\u2019s a big part of what our product does. People searching Google for terms like this might benefit from using it. By ranking high up on SERPs, there\u2019s a higher chance of them finding our helpful content (and product!). In most cases, monitoring this will require a separate analytics tool from what you use to track your other metrics. If you\u2019re on the hunt for a tool to help you track keywords and SERPs, check out our free SEO Tools Guide (there are 27 of them on the list.) 4. Click-through rate (CTR) or conversions One of the most critical metrics for a content marketer to track is click-through rate , or how many clicks toward a specific action a viewer takes after reading, watching, or listening to your content. Yes, page views and time on page are wonderful (and important steps towards content marketing success), but click-throughs on call-to-actions (CTAs) or conversions indicate lead generation. In other words, how many people express more interest in your business thanks to your content efforts. Click-through rates can take many different forms and directions, depending on where the customer is in your digital marketing funnel. Here are some examples: Signs up for your product or service Downloads a piece of software or resource Clicks through to a demo request form Signs up for your newsletter Signs up for an event Joins your community At Buffer, blog-assisted sign-ups are our version of this metric, and we keep a close eye on this in our analytics dashboard (our Head of Communications and Content, Hailley Griffis , explains why below). 5. Time on page The average time your audience spends on your website or reading your blog posts (now called average engagement time in Google Analytics 4) is a strong indicator of your content success. Time on page indicates how deeply your audience is engaging with your content. More time spent suggests that your work is providing value, and less time spent that your content is falling short or not delivering the content the headline of your article promised. 6. Bounce rate Bounce rate tells a similar story to time on page but in a slightly different way. Bounce rate measures the percentage of single-page sessions on your site \u2014 in other words, how many visitors only look at one page before bouncing away again. A high bounce rate means that a large percentage of visitors are leaving your site after viewing only one page. This is the last thing you want as a content marketer, particularly if that visitor enters the site via a piece of content on your blog or the like. While there are many reasons for a bounce (a slow page load time is a common culprit), it\u2019s a not-to-be-ignored sign your content is not helpful to them. 7. Social media metrics Is one of your content marketing goals building brand awareness , being seen as an industry thought leader , or driving website traffic? Then, I\u2019d argue a growing, engaged social media following is one of the most powerful tools in your content marketing toolbox. Not only is social media a powerful content distribution engine, but it\u2019s also a great way to see if the content you\u2019re creating is resonating. Here are some metrics you should consider tracking, no matter which social media platforms you use: Follower or subscriber growth Engagement rate (the number of actions taken on your content \u2014 like, comment, etc. \u2014 per number of followers or subscribers) Post reach or impressions (how many times a post appears in feeds) Social shares (how many times your content is shared) Video views \ud83c\udf89 Buffer will help you track \u2014 and, more importantly, make sense of \u2014 the plethora of social media insights from your social channels in a single dashboard. 8. Newsletter metrics Email marketing is another excellent tool for that content marketer\u2019s toolbox. Email is an owned channel \u2014\u00a0no tricky algorithms to contend with \u2014 and it\u2019s one of the most direct and reliable ways to reach your audience. If you\u2019re leveraging newsletters and email lists in your content marketing efforts, there are three main numbers to pay attention to (all of which you\u2019ll find in the dashboard of your chosen newsletter tool): Subscriber growth or sign-ups Open rate (how many people open your newsletter in their inbox) Click-through rate (how many people click on at least one link in your newsletter) 9. Event sign-ups In many marketing teams, events are considered part and parcel of a company\u2019s content offering (just look at how Goldcast\u2019s Lindsay McGuire handles them below). Events are just content presented live, after all \u2014 and they can be an important source of content to repurpose for short-form videos on social media, YouTube videos, or even blog posts. Events can also be a great way to introduce potential customers to your offering and expertise. Brands like Goldcast will often use high-value events to draw people into their leads ecosystem, perhaps using it to build out a newsletter subscriber base. If events are a key part of your content marketing strategy, then event sign-ups should be one of the numbers you regularly report on. Tied to this is event attendance and the difference between these two numbers (and there will almost always be one) and views on event recordings if you offer them. 10. Output I\u2019m adding this one into the mix with a caveat \u2014 if content output is a metric you track, you must be clear on why. Output for output\u2019s sake, is something of a vanity metric. If you\u2019re not focusing on high-quality content creation with a clear goal in mind (like Hailley Griffis and Eric Doty explain below), delivering ROI on all your hard work is going to be tough. That said, this may involve tracking things like: Blog posts per week Social posts per day Events per month Podcasts per week Content marketing experts on the metrics they care about (+ why) Here\u2019s how the metrics I laid out above look as part of a larger content strategy \u2014\u00a0note how all of them are tied to an important business goal. Hailley Griffis, Buffer Top content marketing metrics: Organic traffic, blog-assisted sign-ups, and articles per week At Buffer, we track the performance of both our blogs \u2014 Buffer Resources and Buffer Library \u2014 in a Mixpanel dashboard that shows us page views for the past seven days, 30 days, and three months at a glance. We measure the success of content in those spaces slightly differently. Since the Library is where our SEO-focused content lives, we track the success of these articles there over a more extended period. On Resources, we focus more on timely content, and so shoot for our results there to be more immediate. As I mentioned above, blog-assisted sign-ups are an essential number for us, too. \u201cIf someone has visited an article on one of our blogs at any point before signing up for Buffer, even if they came in via our homepage or a differe",

      "content_text": "If YouTube was the Starship Enterprise to the creator\u2019s Captain Kirk, then YouTube Studio is Spock and the bridge all rolled into one. Nerd analogies aside, YouTube Studio is the creator\u2019s control room, where you can manage and monitor your videos. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful tool and something content creators must get to grips with if they\u2019re looking to get the most out of their YouTube channel . Monitoring and improving a channel's performance is crucial, and YouTube Studio provides the insights needed to achieve this. But you\u2019re just getting started and finding all the options available to you a little overwhelming, I get it: there\u2019s a lot going on. Luckily, the tool is pretty easy to use once you have the lay of the land. There are multiple ways to navigate to almost any action \u2014 so a bit of clicking around is all you really need to do to find the right system for you. Or, you could read this guide below. Here, I\u2019ll walk you through absolutely everything you need to know about YouTube Studio, including how to edit a video or Short and analyze its performance \u2014 both essential for growing a healthy YouTube subscriber base. \ud83d\ude80 With Buffer, you can share your YouTube Shorts to Instagram, TikTok and other platforms that support video with a few clicks! Here's how \u2192 What is YouTube Studio? YouTube Studio , formerly known as YouTube Creator Studio, is a YouTube tool and app that allows creators to upload, edit, and analyze their videos, as well as respond to comments from their viewers. YouTube Studio offers support to creators by providing access to specific metrics and reports related to user activity and revenue. YouTube Studio is a free tool, and you don\u2019t need a certain number of subscribers to use it \u2014 all you need is a YouTube Channel. It\u2019s worth noting that a YouTube Channel and a YouTube account (read: Google account) are not one and the same. If you just use YouTube to watch videos, a YouTube/Google account will do just fine. If, on the other hand, you want to create and upload your own content, you need a YouTube Channel. Not sure if you have a channel? Head over to studio.youtube.com . If you don\u2019t yet have your own channel, the prompt below will pop up. If you do, you\u2019ll be able to access YouTube Studio. There are multiple ways to access YouTube Studio, both on your computer and on your phone or tablet. On your computer, the quickest route is to navigate over to studio.youtube.com in your browser of choice. If you\u2019re already on YouTube on your computer, click on your profile picture on the top right of your screen, then select YouTube Studio from the drop-down menu. There is also a YouTube Studio mobile app you can download on your device. Not to be confused with the regular YouTube app, it must be downloaded separately. Here\u2019s the YouTube Studio download link for Android Here\u2019s the YouTube Studio download link for iPhone While it may be easier to manage your videos in the browser/desktop version of YouTube Studio, it\u2019s worthwhile downloading the app and turning on notifications to get updates about comments and stay engaged with your subscribers. What can you do in YouTube Studio? Perhaps the better question is, \u2018What can't you do?' The best way to explain that is to give you the lay of the land, so I'll walk you through the various sections of the tool and what you can do within each. You'll find all the sections I highlight below on the left-hand side of your screen on your desktop. On the YouTube Studio app, the tabs are at the bottom of your phone screen. In this guide, I'll be referring to the desktop version of YouTube Studio, but the processes for the app are nearly identical. I asked Buffer's Social Media Manager, Mitra Mehvar , which sections might be worth getting to grips with first. \u201cI'm always finding myself in the Content and Analytics sections,\u201d she told me. \u201cFrom the Content section I can get an overview of everything I have scheduled or have posted, and can get a quick glimpse into the analytics for my most recently shared videos.\u201d Dashboard The YouTube Studio Dashboard is effectively your studio homepage. Here, you\u2019ll get a high-level overview of your latest video\u2019s performance and all the new activity on your channel, latest comments, and new subscribers. You\u2019ll also find updates and new features from YouTube that might be helpful to you, plus some ideas to help you build or keep momentum on the platform. Content The Content tab is where you'll find everything you've uploaded. Full-length videos, Shorts live streams , and playlists all live here \u2014 so you'll likely spend a lot of time in this part of the studio as a YouTube Creator. Clicking on the videos and posts will take you over to a page like the one below, where you'll be able to change pretty much anything about the upload. A new set of tabs will appear on the left, giving you access to analytics for that specific video and even a basic video editor, where you can trim and make other tweaks to the clips. Analytics In the Analytics section, you can dive into the performance of your channel overall, the performance of each content type (videos, Shorts, lives, and posts), plus some handy information about your audience, their demographics, and how they interact with your content. Much like the rest of the sections in YouTube Studio, Comments does exactly what it says on the tin. Here, you can view and reply to comments on your videos. It's also where you'll find mentions from other YouTubers. Subtitles Subtitles , like the Content tab, will also take you to a list of your videos, ordered from latest to oldest. Clicking on the specific videos will take you to a page much like what you'll find under Content, but straight to the subtitles section, where you can add or edit the captions of all your videos. Copyright Under the Copyright section, you'll find all the copyright challenges to your videos. You can also use the button on the top right corner, \u2018New removal request', to make a challenge of your own. Earn Earn is an important part of YouTube Studio for creators in the YouTube Partner Program \u2014 it\u2019s where you can track your eligibility and manage your monetization settings. YouTube Studio also supports creators by providing detailed revenue metrics and reports. Customization Under Customization , you can tweak your channel's layout, branding, and basic info. You'll find a handy guide to YouTube channel optimization here , which unpacks how to approach all these fields for best results. Audio Library Audio Library is another tab worth familiarizing yourself with. Here, you\u2019ll find free music and sound effects to use in your videos. You can listen to them and, if you like, save them for later by clicking the star icon next to their name. You\u2019ll find your saved audio under the Starred tab. YouTube Studio also integrates with YouTube Music for managing podcast content, where a podcast show functions as a playlist and episodes are presented as videos. How to use YouTube Studio Now that you know your way around YouTube Studio, it won't be hard to figure out how to perform various tasks within the platform. I'll walk you through some of the essential ones below. How to upload a new video To upload a shiny new video or Short to your YouTube Channel, hit the Create button on the top right of your screen (it\u2019s visible in almost every section of YouTube Studio). The process is exactly the same for longer YouTube videos and YouTube Shorts \u2014 videos 60 seconds or under will be automatically tagged as the latter. From there: From the Create drop-down menu, choose \u2018Upload videos\u2019. Drag and drop the video files to upload into the window that pops up. While the video uploads, you can get to work by choosing a video title, entering a description, uploading a thumbnail, selecting or creating a playlist, and choosing the appropriate audience. Once you\u2019re done with the first window, click \u2018Video elements\u2019 at the top of the window. There, you can add subtitles, as well as cards and an end screen to show viewers related videos, websites, and calls to action. From there, click on \u2018Checks\u2019 at the top of the window. Here, you\u2019ll find results from YouTube\u2019s standard check for copyright and other issues. Next, head over to \u2018Visibility\u2019 at the top of the window to choose whether your video will be public, private, or unlisted (only available to someone with the direct link) and schedule a time for your video to go live. It\u2019s worth noting that if you want to make changes to the file itself \u2014 like trimming the clip \u2014 you\u2019ll need to use the process I\u2019ve laid out below under \u2018How to edit a video in YouTube Studio\u2019. How to edit videos in YouTube Studio YouTube Studio is incredibly versatile when it comes to editing. Almost every aspect of a video or Short can be tweaked, whether you've already made it public or not (incredibly handy when you've spotted a typo in your caption!). To edit a video you've already uploaded: Click on the Content tab on the left-hand side of your screen. Click on the video you'd like to edit. You can use the search bar at the top of the screen to find it if it's not near the top of the list. Under the video details tab on the right, you can change the video title, the description, the thumbnail, add it to or remove it from a playlist, or change the audience. Using the list on the right, you can change the video's visibility and subtitles and add or remove your end screen or cards. To change the video itself, click on the Editor tab. Here, you'll find YouTube Studio's lightweight editor. You can cut or trim the footage and add a blur, music or sounds, an end screen, and info cards. How to delete a video from YouTube Deleting a video in YouTube Studio is pretty straightforward. Again, you'll start in the Content tab. From your list of videos in the Content section, select the one you want to delete. Choose \u2018More actions' from the black bar that appears above the video list and choose \u2018Delete forever' A pop-up will appear, reminding yo",

      "content_text": "If you\u2019ve been around here a while, you\u2019ll know that crunching the numbers to figure out the best time to post on all major social media platforms is basically our love language. And now we have enough data to add Threads to our roster, too! Because even though Threads uses an algorithm to decide what you (and your target audience) sees in the feed, when you post still has an impact. And now we have the data to prove it. We analyzed hundreds of thousands of Threads posts sent through Buffer \u2014 730K posts, to be precise \u2014 to figure out if some time slots stood out in terms of post performance. (Spoiler: there were a few.) Our primary metric for this study was median engagement by hour, day, and content type. Let\u2019s break down what we found. Jump to a section: The best time to post on Threads The best time to post on Threads at a glance The best time to post on Threads on Monday The best time to post on Threads on Tuesday The best time to post on Threads on Wednesday The best time to post on Threads on Thursday The best time to post on Threads on Friday The best time to post on Threads on Saturday The best time to post on Threads on Sunday The best and worst days to post on Threads The best content type to post on Threads Checklist for high-performing Threads posts The best time to post on Threads The best time to post on Threads is 7 a.m. on Wednesday . Posts published then had the highest median engagement \u2014 that is likes, replies, and reposts \u2014 across all the data we analyzed. Other high-performing times were 7 a.m. \u2013 9 a.m. on weekdays , especially Tuesday through Friday. So, generally speaking, most weekday mornings are great windows to aim for. An interesting \u2018outlier\u2019 time that popped up in our study was 1 a.m. on Sunday. As you can see from the heatmap graph above, it ranks in the top five posting times for Threads. It\u2019s proof that, while the hours with the highest median engagement rates tend to be between 7 and 9, it can still be worth experimenting with other posting times to see what works best for your audience. As always, I like to look at social media platform demographics to paint a clearer picture of why this is the case (though it\u2019s only theoretical). Threads, which burst onto the scene mid-2023, now boasts around 350 million monthly active users . And, as of February 2025, almost a third (around 29%) of Threads users were aged between 25 and 34 years, Statista reports . The 18-24-year-old cohort comes in second place, at 20%. It\u2019s a fair assumption, then, that most Threads users are part of the workforce, and prefer to check their feeds before locking in at work for the day. Interestingly, these times lines up pretty well with our analysis the best time to post on Twitter/X , where optimal times are early to mid-mornings on weekdays as well. \ud83c\udf0e Wait, what time zone? To make this data easier to understand, our data scientist Bufferoo has done some mathematical magic to make the recommended time zones universally applicable. In other words, no need to convert \u2014\u00a0consider all the recommendations local time. Whether you're in EST (Eastern Standard Time), PST (Pacific Standard Time), or IST (Indian Standard Time), the times apply to you. The best time to post on Threads at a glance Here are the top posting times for each day of the week, based on median engagement: Monday: 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 8 a.m. Tuesday: 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 3 p.m. Wednesday: 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 8 a.m. Thursday: 9 a.m., 7 a.m., 11 p.m. Friday: 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 8 a.m. Saturday: 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 12 a.m. Sunday: 1 a.m., 7 a.m., 9 a.m. The best time to post on Threads on Monday The best time to post on Threads on Monday for maximum engagement is 7 a.m., with other optimal posting times at 9 a.m. and 8 a.m. The best time to post on Threads on Tuesday The best time to post on Threads on Tuesday is 7 a.m., followed closely by 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. The best time to post on Threads on Wednesday The best time to post on Threads on Wednesday is 7 a.m.,\u00a0with\u00a09 a.m. and 8 a.m. also being strong posting windows. Wednesday is the best day of the week to post on Threads in terms of general engagement, so it\u2019s well worth adding to your content calendar. The best time to post on Threads on Thursday On Thursday, the best time to post on Threads is 9 a.m., with 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. also performing well. The late evening slot is one of the few high-performers in our analysis \u2014 so add this to your calendar if you\u2019re a night owl poster. The best time to post on Threads on Friday The best time to post on Friday is 7 a.m., with 9 a.m. and 8 a.m. also being optimal posting times for maximum engagement. The best time to post on Threads on Saturday The best time to post on Threads on Saturday is 7 a.m., with other peak hours at 9 a.m. and 12 a.m. (midnight). That said, Saturday had the second lowest overall engagement, so you might want to schedule your Threads posts for weekdays instead. The best time to post on Threads on Sunday The best time to post on Threads on Sunday is 1 a.m., with 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. also being peak times to post for maximum engagement on this slower day. Sunday was just a smidge lower than Saturday in terms of total engagement, making it the worst day to post on Threads. \ud83d\udca1 Just as there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all best time to post, there\u2019s no single best time to post across all social media platforms. Here\u2019s the best time to post on Instagram , the best time to post on Twitter/X , and the best time to post on LinkedIn . The best and worst days to post on Threads Based on overall daily engagement, Wednesday is the best day to post on Threads. It\u2019s followed closely by Friday and Thursday \u2014 midweek is clearly prime Threads time. On the flip side, Sunday sees the lowest engagement overall, with Saturday not far behind. If you\u2019re batch-scheduling content for the week, you might want to give those weekend posts a second thought. \u26a1 Post consistently on Threads with Buffer: Buffer helps you kickstart meaningful conversations \u2014 and grow your following \u2014 with planning, scheduling, and analytics tools. Start for free \u2192 The best content type to post on Threads As an added bonus, we also explored what type of content performed best on Threads. We discovered that posts with images had the highest engagement, followed by videos. Here\u2019s how the formats ranked in terms of median engagement per post: \ud83d\udcf8 Picture: 5.17% \ud83c\udfa5 Video: 5.14% \ud83d\udd17 Link: 3.78% \u270d\ufe0f Text: 3.23% To put that into perspective, posts with images performed 0.58% better than videos, 36.77% better than links, and 60.06% better than text. While Threads may feel like a casual, text-driven space, visuals still stop the scroll. It\u2019s worth experimenting with eye-catching images or short, engaging videos to stand out in the feed. That said, I\u2019d suggest taking this data with a pinch of salt \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean you have to suddenly start creating carousels or videos in order to grow on Threads. The best content format for you is the one you can create most consistently. Checklist for high-performing Threads posts A word to the wise: good post timing won\u2019t save a mediocre post. While timing can help give a solid posts a little boost, it\u2019s not the key to social media success. The quality of your content and relevance for your audience will always be the most important factor when it comes to performance on Threads (and any social media platform, really). Here are some quick tips to help you tick all the boxes. \ud83d\udca1 For more guidance, check out How to Get More Followers on Threads: 9 Tactics to Help You Grow . Find and own your niche Threads rewards specificity. Whether you\u2019re into music theory, social media strategy, or mushroom art, leaning into your interests helps attract the right kind of followers \u2014 and better conversations. Use tags to reach the right people Threads tags work more like topic signals than old-school hashtags. Thoughtfully tagging your posts helps them reach like-minded folks, and shows Threads what conversations you want to be part of. Here\u2019s a great example from Buffer\u2019s Hailley Griffis , who regularly uses tags to make sure her posts show up in the right circles: Prioritize conversation, not broadcasting Comments are currency on Threads, and highly prioritized by the Threads algorithm . Spark discussions with open-ended questions or takes people want to respond to \u2014 and don\u2019t forget to reply and jump into other people\u2019s threads, too. Here\u2019s a great conversation starter by Threads creator Lennox Saint . Talk about what\u2019s happening now Just like on X, timeliness matters. Whether it\u2019s a viral moment or a news headline, joining active conversations can boost your reach and make your content feel more relevant. Annie-Mai\u2019s Girl Power Marketing shares tips, tricks, trends, and the latest social media news to keep her content current. Keep it real (and helpful) Threads feels more \u201cpeople-first\u201d than many other platforms \u2014 and users seem to reward kindness, honesty, and vulnerability.

Post consistently Threads moves fast. If you\u2019re serious about growth, post as often as you\u2019re able \u2014 even just quick thoughts or a response on someone else\u2019s post. This tends to correlate with faster growth, especially in the early stages of building your audience.

      "content_text": "From the moment I started my company, Motif Skincare , I knew I was entering a crowded market with high customer acquisition costs. It would be challenging to compete with influencers and larger brands when it comes to fueling new customer discovery. As such, the primary goal was to create products that truly made a difference in people's routines\u2014products they would discover and want to buy again and again\u2014and to focus our marketing efforts on fostering that hyper-loyalty. This isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t do any top-of-the-funnel marketing. We utilize many of the traditional growth channels: organic social, paid ads, influencers and affiliates, and PR. But instead of using channels like social to solely push sales, we root our strategy in retention marketing, focusing on email signups as a goal. This allows us to focus on building a relationship with customers over time, turning email into a high-impact channel that boasts over 50 percent open rates and drives a large percentage of our revenue. Brand emails can feel so impersonal these days, but I think someone signing up for your email list is an intimate thing. It\u2019s the closest many of us will ever be to our customers, and I don\u2019t take that lightly as a founder. Here are the ways I\u2019ve prioritized a personalized feel to my email marketing so my customers feel valued\u2014and want to keep buying from us for years to come. We don\u2019t just sell in our emails The traditional way of approaching email marketing as an e-commerce company goes something like this: Talk about your product, flip the script and talk about your product a little differently, now maybe offer a discount for your product, and so on. I\u2019m the first person to unsubscribe from emails that feel like they\u2019re bombarding me, so I always wanted to personalize our email strategy with content our customers are excited to read. What that came down to for us is leaning into content around topics related to our space as much as we talk about our products. We want to be a meaningful destination for customers as they navigate their skincare journeys, but we also want to engage them in a broader conversation around progress and potential\u2014because when you can spend less time worrying about your skin, you free up headspace to invest elsewhere in the things you love. So, our emails often talk about the science of good skincare, address trends and debunk myths, and interview inspired individuals on thoughtful topics, all of which makes great email content. Teaching email subscribers that we are going to be a reliable source of useful and inspiring information bolsters our open and engagement rates across the board. These educational emails often have lower unsubscribe rates and can drive 10 to 20 percent higher click-through rates than other types of emails, which helps improve engagement metrics across the board. When customers see us in their inbox, they\u2019ve come to trust that we\u2019re sending them something worth reading, so we feel confident we can capture their attention even when inboxes become especially crowded during peak promotional periods. It takes more work to provide valuable content instead of just touting our products, but we lighten the load for our small team by doing a lot of content repurposing . For instance, if our social media manager is creating a slideshow around a skincare topic or working with a particular influencer, we think about how that content could be expanded or reframed into an email. This creates consistent messaging across channels and helps draw customers deeper into our funnel. We make customers feel like we\u2019re emailing one-to-one Personalization is the north star for succeeding at retention marketing. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, we\u2019ve found an edge by spending a little extra time making sure that most touchpoints have some element of personalization. It\u2019s not all that hard to do, especially if you have your tech stack set up to ingest all the data you have about who you\u2019re emailing. For example, when we are emailing customers about sales or new products, we like to reference the context of their prior relationship with us. When we launched our second product, the Brightening Serum , we reached out to folks with messages like: \u201cWe noticed that you\u2019ve repurchased our cleanser X many times, and we are so appreciative of that. We think you\u2019d really enjoy our next product.\u201d This shows subscribers that we\u2019re paying attention to them as individual customers, which fuels loyalty and retention. Sometimes, personalization is as simple as making it feel like we\u2019re emailing them individually. We send a lot of plain text emails: Unformatted emails that hit our customers\u2019 inboxes and look like I literally sat down and typed a message for them. It\u2019s meaningful for our customers to feel like they got a note straight from the founder, and a lot of people will respond directly to these emails. While the initial email blast isn\u2019t actually one-to-one, we always make sure to reply to anyone who writes back so they know we\u2019re real people behind the scenes and that we truly do hear them. Almost no one unsubscribes from these types of emails, and they tend to have higher than average engagement rates because of their intimate-feeling nature. We segment our most engaged and our least engaged Segmenting our email list to only send certain messages to certain cohorts is another aspect of our personalization strategy. There are so many ways to divvy up your subscribers as a brand, but we like to focus on the most engaged and the least engaged. For the most engaged, we look for ways to reward them. Whenever we\u2019re going to run a sale or launch a new product, we cut a list of what we consider our best customers (based on both purchase behavior and engagement) and send them a first-to-know campaign, giving them access to the deal before anyone else has it. We typically use those plain-text emails I mentioned above and focus the messaging on building goodwill with these customers while making them feel valued. These are by far the best-performing touchpoints we send, with open and click-through rates that are upwards of 20 percent higher than other promotional emails (sometimes over 100 percent higher) and the highest conversion rates we see across our program. We also segment out our least engaged subscribers by not emailing them. It\u2019s tempting to maximize your list by emailing everyone, but the reality is only a portion of your list is going to remain active and impactful, and those who don\u2019t can actually hurt you in the long run. We generally only send emails to people who have engaged with one of our messages in the past six months, making exceptions for bigger moments that might have a better chance of re-engaging a lapsed subscriber. When you consistently send to disengaged subscribers, it signals to inbox providers that your emails aren\u2019t relevant, and over time, this can result in more of your emails landing in spam. By removing disengaged folks (once we\u2019ve unsuccessfully attempted to re-engage them, of course), we\u2019re able to maintain and even improve our metrics overall. Nobody wants to give up on an email subscriber, but it\u2019s important to think more holistically than that about the health of your program list as a whole. We measure against our own benchmarks to learn what works for our customers When it comes to email marketing or any marketing strategy, it\u2019s so tempting to mimic what everyone else is doing. You can find endless content around best practices and benchmarks, and those are great starting points, but at the end of the day, you have to figure out what works for your brand and your customers\u2014meaning the most important benchmark is your own. When we started building our email program, we drew a line in the sand showing where our engagement metrics were sitting and then got to testing. We tested smaller elements like subject lines and send times. We tested bigger elements like how frequently people wanted to hear from us and what kind of content they resonated with most. With each test, we looked at how our audience responded and used that to inform and iterate our broader strategy. Along the way, we inevitably tried things that just didn't work, but we also took some big, out-of-the-box swings that paid off. It takes time to figure out the right retention strategy for your brand, but if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort to experiment and pay close attention to how your audience responds, it will pay off in dividends.

      "content_text": "I\u2019ve been carrying the same Patagonia Toromiro for the best part of a decade. I bought it ahead of our company retreat in Madrid more than eight years ago, and since then it\u2019s been a faithful companion through international travel, coffee shop work sessions, and countless trips (it just about holds enough for a week away, and still fits under an airline seat). It\u2019s simple, tough, and functional. But recently it\u2019s started to show its age, helped along by my dog, who chewed on the straps during his teething phase. Those little scars make me smile now, but they\u2019re also a reminder that this bag has been through a lot, and that it might finally be time to replace it. My first thought was to buy the same bag again. But when I discovered Patagonia had discontinued the Toromiro, I started hunting for an alternative. Ahead of our most recent company retreat , it hit me: the best place to find advice wasn\u2019t gear review sites, it was my colleagues. Remote workers take their bags seriously, and every choice carries a mix of practicality, taste, and lessons learned the hard way. Here\u2019s what I learned from my teammates at Buffer about the best bags for remote work. Style vs. function (or both?) One big theme that came through clearly from my colleagues is that a bag needs to work hard and look good. Tami , for example, uses two different bags depending on the context: an Away Active Daypack for travel, and a Manu Atelier Le Cambon when she\u2019s \u201cworking outside\u201d locally. \u201cBackpacks are too \u2018high school\u2019 for me,\u201d she joked, though she admits the comfort trade-off is worth it when traveling. Diego also prioritizes aesthetics. He carries a Coach purse for day-to-day use, pairing it with a Muji carry-on when traveling. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not very practical,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut I just do it because I think it\u2019s better looking. I\u2019m prioritizing fashion over confident practicality.\u201d Suzanne , meanwhile, has found the sweet spot. Her CALPAK Kaya gives her \u201cstyle and function,\u201d carrying everything she needs but nothing more, keeping it lightweight and easy to use. As she puts it: \u201cI get loads of compliments on it!\u201d Sometimes the best bag choice isn\u2019t deliberate at all. Arek bought a Jack Wolfskin TRT 65 L hiking pack, which came with a detachable 10L daypack. He only used the big hiking bag once or twice, but the small detachable backpack became his everyday companion, traveling with him around the world. It fits his laptop, works great for city life and hikes, and even has fun extras like a built-in bottle opener. His friends say he\u2019s permanently attached to it. Bags with history Another surprise was just how long some of these bags have lasted. Octa has been using the same Incase shoulder bag for 11 years. It\u2019s compact, durable, and still protects his laptop\u2014he once saw it fall from an airplane overhead bin, only to find the laptop unharmed. Hailley has carried her Knomo Beauchamp Backpack 14 for nearly a decade and still loves its timeless design and practicality. Suzanne still owns her North Face backpack from college, now 19 years old and still in regular rotation for travel. And Eric stuck with his Moshi bag for six years, only switching recently after the zipper finally gave out - though in a testament to quality, the company replaced the whole thing under its 10-year warranty. Clearly, it\u2019s not just me who is hanging on to a much-loved bag. Packing habits and hard lessons My colleagues aren\u2019t just picky about their bags; they\u2019re also full of clever tips and stories, which turned out to be the insightful part of our conversations. Amanda realised that her new Stubble & Co bag had a side zip to the laptop compartment when her laptop nearly slipped out of it. A quick catch saved it from teammates who saw it about to fall. Andy , one of Buffer\u2019s many photography enthusiasts, also quickly learned to double-check his zippers after a camera lens almost fell out of his Peak Design backpack mid-trip. Daisy swears by compartments: her Blast Quick Access backpack has made her, in her words, \u201can organization nerd,\u201d keeping essentials like chargers, passport, and headphones exactly where she needs them. Kelly \u2019s approach is to use the same packing list every trip, always putting the most important items (passport, wallet, phone) at the top of both the list and her bag, a North Face Jester backpack , so they\u2019re easy to check off and grab quickly. Several people shared lessons about packing less. \u201cAlways pack less than you think you need,\u201d says Hailley. Tami echoed this: \u201cI\u2019ve slowly been unlearning overpacking.\u201d Diego takes this further, suggesting leaving up to a quarter of your bag empty to make space for gifts or purchases along the way. Almost everyone mentioned water resistance as non-negotiable, whether to survive a rainy commute or just the inevitable spilled coffee. And Eric offers the most pragmatic tip of all: \u201cAlways put a couple of pairs of underwear and a charger in your backpack if you\u2019re flying - you never know if your suitcase will go missing.\u201d My takeaway Talking to my colleagues reminded me that the right bag is about more than specs. For remote workers, a bag becomes part of daily rituals and big adventures, carrying not just laptops and chargers but years of memories. For now, my Toromiro is sticking with me. It\u2019s had a bit of a freshen up in the washing machine, and although it\u2019s still a little battered, it does the job. When the time comes to replace it, I\u2019ll have plenty of inspiration from my teammates - here\u2019s my checklist for my next remote bag: Is there capacity for unexpected extras (like gifts or gear)? Is it water-resistant enough for rain (or spilled coffee)? Does it have compartments where I need them, without too much \u201cfaff\u201d? Does it hit the sweet spot of looks, practicality, and durability? Will it survive years of travel, and does it have a solid warranty? Do zippers, straps, and closures feel reliable? If I can\u2019t check it out in real life before purchasing, is there a solid returns policy?

Buffer is ideal if you want one simple place to plan, schedule, repurpose, and analyze all your content across multiple platforms. 3 reasons to try YouTube Shorts scheduling Scheduling your YouTube Shorts is a smart way to stay consistent and keep your creative process flowing (especially when a tool like Buffer makes it super simple to see everything in one place). Scheduling YouTube shorts helps: 1. Build consistency (and your audience) A steady posting rhythm builds trust and keeps viewers coming back for more. More than any other reason, scheduling allows you to build consistency with your content creation, which can be powerful for growing an audience. As I write this article, I\u2019m committing to posting at least one YouTube Short per week. I have plenty of content to use from the #FreelanceLife podcast that I co-host, but I\u2019ve never really focused on posting the shorts because it just felt like something extra to remember. But it will actually be manageable for me to schedule a month\u2019s worth of shorts in one shot. So, it\u2019s now in the calendar: 2. Save time, and stay ahead of the scramble of \u201cwhat do I post today?\u201d Instead of scrambling for last-minute video ideas, you can batch-create content and even use Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant to polish descriptions or captions. When you work ahead, you can spend less time stressing about posting every day and more time actually creating cool content. 3. Keep your workflow organized across multiple platforms Scheduling lets you see the bigger picture. With Buffer\u2019s centralized dashboard, you can see at a glance what\u2019s going live, when, and on which platforms. It keeps your workflow tidy and your content strategy on track without the chaos of switching between apps. \u26a1 Here are 13 tried-and-tested tips for getting more views on YouTube. Quick tips for scheduling YouTube Shorts Now that you know the how and why of scheduling your YouTube Shorts, let\u2019s get into some helpful tips to help you become a shorts sensation. Managing multiple YouTube channels? If you\u2019re running more than one YouTube channel, keep things simple by managing them all under one Google account. Use a tool like Buffer to organize uploads, track YouTube analytics, and plan content across channels all in one place. Use a scheduling tool like Buffer to automatically post for you Save yourself from switching tabs and juggling platforms. Buffer lets you plan, repurpose, and publish shorts (and other content) all from one dashboard. It\u2019s like having one control center for everything, so you can focus more on making content and less on logistics. Commit to a content calendar cadence Consistency builds trust (and views). Choose a content creation process and schedule that feels realistic for you \u2014 maybe it\u2019s twice a week, maybe it\u2019s daily \u2014 and stick to it. Buffer helps by letting you queue up content ahead of time so even busy weeks don\u2019t derail your plan. As I mentioned above, I\u2019m committing to posting one Short per week (scheduled in batches on Buffer). Am I going to become a full-time YouTuber from this strategy? Highly unlikely. But I know it\u2019s a cadence I can keep to, and that\u2019s the most important thing. Create multiple videos in one go No matter the platform or the format, batching is a superpower. When you block out time to film, edit, and schedule several shorts at once, you reduce decision fatigue and wasted time later. With Buffer, you can upload multiple shorts in one go, tweak captions or descriptions (try out the AI Assistant), and spread them out over your calendar. Turn longer videos into shorts You\u2019ve probably already got footage sitting around or long-form videos that have great bits inside them. Snip exciting or valuable moments into shorts so that you can feed your Short-content pipeline without always shooting fresh. This is my strategy \u2014\u00a0 I\u2019m already filming video content for the podcast, and it doesn\u2019t take much more time to pick out some key moments to repurpose into shorts. If you have a content idea, but you\u2019re not ready to film and post, save it in your Buffer Create Space. Post at the best time Although there are no hard-and-fast rules, there are likely peak times when people are more likely to see your content. According to our research , the best time to post YouTube Shorts (and all YouTube content) is Wednesday at 4 p.m . The next best times are 4 p.m. on Thursday and 4 p.m. on Monday, respectively. Note: Our dataset weighed the median views of all YouTube videos, not YouTube Shorts in isolation. Save your post ideas for later Got a great content idea but not ready to film or post your video immediately? Drop it into your Buffer Create Space, then come back to polish and schedule it when you\u2019re ready. Track analytics and engagement After publishing your content, keep an eye on what\u2019s working so you can tailor your shorts accordingly. You can test out different titles, and thumbnail styles, see where view drops happen, what people comment on, and more. Buffer\u2019s reporting and YouTube Studio analytics show you metrics like traffic sources, audience behavior, overall viewership, watch time, subscriber growth, click-through rate, and more.

But don\u2019t let that feeling discourage you. It\u2019s all part of the process. And, with the right tactics, it's definitely possible to get more views on YouTube in 2025. Even if you\u2019re a complete newbie! In this article, I\u2019ll share 13 tried-and-tested tips on how to get more views on YouTube. Whether you\u2019re someone who just created their channel or you\u2019ve been stuck on the same average viewership numbers for a while, there\u2019s something here for everyone. Jump to a section: 1. Focus on your idea first 2. Think of your YouTube channel like a TV show 3. Treat your thumbnails and titles like hooks 4. Add keywords in your title, description, tags, and subtitles 5. Hop on niche and platform-related trends 6. Cross-promote your YouTube videos on other channels 7. Repurpose your long-form videos for YouTube Shorts 8. Collaborate with other creators in your niche 9. Use YouTube cards and end screens 10. Analyze your YouTube analytics 11. Engage your audience in the first 30 seconds 12. Post when your viewers are online 13. Remember YouTube is a long game 1. Focus on your idea first It\u2019s easy to get swept up in filming, editing, and thumbnails, without really spending much time and energy on your video idea itself. But beautiful sets,\u00a0 fancy thumbnails, and slick editing can\u2019t make up for a weak video topic. You want to find video ideas that are familiar and unexpected. In other words, something they\u2019re already interested in (familiar) but also something they want to learn more about (unexpected). Great video ideas start with a deep understanding of your audience.\u00a0 \u201cYou need to understand your ideal viewer,\u201d says YouTube creator Cara Nicole . \u201cAsk yourself: What are they already interested in? How do they want to be talked to? What news and cultural trends are they paying attention to? That gives you a starting point for making videos that resonate.\u201d There are plenty of ways to find content ideas for YouTube, but here are my three favorite ones (all beginner-friendly): How to find great YouTube ideas Google Search for a question your audience would look for on Google. If you\u2019re a productivity creator, try searching \u2018how to be productive\u2019 on Google.\u201d Look for the \u2018People also ask\u2019 and \u2018People also search for\u2019 sections. These are real audience questions \u2014 and you might even find a ready-made title in them. You can take this further by searching for more specific questions your audience is asking.\u00a0 For example, if you\u2019re making videos for someone struggling to be productive while working from home, search for \u201chow to be productive while working from home.\u201d You\u2019ll find plenty of ideas in the \u2018People also ask\u2019 and \u2018People also search for\u2019 sections. YouTube Trends In YouTube Studio , you\u2019ll find an \u201cTrends\u201d tab under the \u201cAnalytics\u201d section. You\u2019ll find ideas based on what your audience watches and what you\u2019ve already posted.\u00a0 Some of them might be a hit and miss, but you can find some inspiration here, directly from YouTube! Try typing a basic query into the YouTube search bar to see top keywords and how popular they are. You\u2019ll also find some videos similar to the ones you\u2019ve searched for below. Question comments and YouTube Community This one\u2019s simple: Listen to your audience and see what follow-up questions they have left on your videos. You can try this on other platforms too \u2014 not just YouTube. If you\u2019re new to YouTube and don\u2019t have a lot of comments from your audience, do a competitor analysis and check the comment section of creators in your niche. What are the follow-up questions people have? These can be your future video ideas. To find breakout ideas, go to a competitor\u2019s profile and click on the \u2018Popular\u2019 tab.. These are the videos that outperformed the others. If it\u2019s a topic you can make your own, it could be a winning idea for your channel. Jade Beason , founder at Social People Agency , also suggests doing the same exercise using YouTube\u2019s search bar: \u201cSearch broad topics around your niche and then filter it based on content shared within the last month or year (depending on how popular and time-sensitive your niche is),\u201d she recommends. \u201cThen, look for any videos that received more views than the number of subscribers that the creator has. That\u2019s a clear sign that it was pushed out by YouTube\u2019s algorithm,\u201d Jade says \u201cRepeat this process to see if you can find any inspiration or patterns for your future video topics. But remember to use other creators\u2019 videos for inspiration, not imitation.\u201d Similarly, if you have a tiny audience on YouTube already, you can also use the YouTube Community Posts to communicate with your audience and test content ideas. For example, YouTuber Alina tested the waters about a topic with a Community Post on YouTube . Once there was enough interest, she turned it into a video . How to make your YouTube ideas stand out Once you figure out your video ideas, the next problem is that YouTube is extremely competitive and saturated in almost every niche. How do you stand out? \u201cAnalyze the market and then find your competitive edge,\u201d recommends YouTuber Ali Abdaal . \u201cThink in which domains can you stand out \u2014 for example, depth of research, storytelling, editing, relatability, or authenticity.\u201d This is consistent with what YouTube employee, Rene Ritchie , recommends , too: \u201cWhat makes you different? What makes you interesting? If you're just going to copy what somebody else does \u2014 unless you can do it so significantly better that people will just rush to you \u2014 it's probably gonna be really hard,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you can figure out what makes you unique, I think there are just unlimited possibilities.\u201d A great example of this is Cleo Abrams . Her YouTube videos are all about optimistic tech. But her stand out quality is the depth of research on every topic and the stunning animations. Source Another way to stand out is to adapt a format from a different or adjacent niche into your YouTube videos. \u201cYou can kind of take things over from different niches. Let's say it's golf. Are there any other niches that have a certain level of adjacency to golf? You can apply [similar] formats in so many niches,\u201d says YouTuber Paddy Galloway . \u201cIt sounds simple, but so much of our success through my consulting company is by seeing what is working in different niches. What is a format that other people are not doing yet that we could bring over and adapt?\u201d For example, I spotted this video titled \u201c the 1-page business plan that made me $200K+ in 2024 \u201d on my home page. Here\u2019s how creators from different niches could adapt this idea: Food creator : the 1 easy breakfast recipe that helped me reach my protein goal Productivity creator : the 1 productivity technique that saved me 5 hours a week Finance creator : the 1 financial advice that helped me save $10K in 2025 Your video ideas are the foundation of your YouTube channel. Before you worry about thumbnails or SEO (search engine optimization) tweaks, make sure your ideas are solid and your unique edge is clear. 2. Think of your YouTube channel like a TV show YouTube\u2019s playlist feature is one of the best ways to encourage viewers to binge-watch your videos. But to use playlists, you have to think strategically and lay video topics on top of one another. \u201cI think people underestimate the power of viewer journeys. Someone comes in to watch your video. They should be able to watch 2, 3, or 4 videos immediately after that. Binging is probably the fastest way to grow a channel,\u201d says Rene. \u201cIf you start giving them a bunch of things that don't really relate to them, it's the equivalent of a TV show that doesn't have consistent episodes; it's always a different show.\u201d \u201cIf you create a video about how to fix your washing machine one day and how to fix your refrigerator the next week, it's very unlikely people are going to have those two problems back to back,\u201d he explains with an example. \u201cBut if you create a series about how to fix your dishwasher, best parts to fix your dishwasher, how to make sure you don't need to fix your dishwasher, then people who watch those videos are going to have three, four videos to keep watching.\u201d Content series are an excellent way to keep your audience coming back for more on many social media platforms. And YouTube is no different. Take Cara Nicole\u2019s financial audit series \u2014 I keep coming back to these because I want to know which character she\u2019ll pick next, which concepts are consistent across multiple characters, etc. The arc builds and continues. I finish one and immediately want to watch the next. \u201cOnce you\u2019re publishing regularly, you can use analytics and comments to see what\u2019s actually hitting. That\u2019s how most of my series came about. I noticed one video concept was performing really well, and I expanded it into a playlist or recurring theme,\u201d says Cara. \u201cDon\u2019t expect to have a perfect content strategy from day one. Instead, start by making things your ideal viewer would care about. Then pay close attention to what\u2019s working. Over time, you\u2019ll find patterns that can evolve into signature series.\u201d Another great example is Makari Espe . She has multiple YouTube playlists on her channel, all of which are about different challenges she has undertaken to make her life better. Once you start watching, it\u2019s hard not to click the next video \u2014 you want to see how she fares. It also helps that her video ideas are in that \u2018familiar but unexpected\u2019 category we talked about earlier. So, while forming your YouTube strategy, think of related video topics that you can convert into an episodic series. This will help you create a domino effect and get more views on your videos \u2014 especially if a single one in the series goes viral. It\u2019s also a great strategy to build a loyal community and gain more subscribers on your channel. 3. Treat your thumbnails and titles like hooks YouTube is a click-and-watch social m",

Learn more and get started at https://buffer.com/mastodon Mastodon is currently going through an explosive phase of growth . Some people say it reminds them of the early days of Twitter. Why is it growing so fast, and why now? It's largely due to its decentralized structure and mission to build a safe and stable social network without any corporate interference. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, Mastodon is not-for-profit. It\u2019s not owned by anyone and is run by the community that uses it. It primarily uses a chronological feed and it doesn\u2019t serve ads or collect your personal data. In other words, it stands in stark contrast to the \"big tech\" social networks you're probably more familiar with and offers something new and exciting. But because Mastodon has a chronological feed, unless you are posting consistently and at all times of the day, your posts might not be seen by a large chunk of the community. This is where scheduling comes in. With Buffer\u2019s newest integration, you can plan your Mastodon posts in advance and schedule them at specific times to reach your audience when they are online. It\u2019s particularly powerful if you want to share across multiple timezones and spread your posts out \u2013 rather than posting all your ideas at once. How to schedule Mastodon posts with Buffer First things first, if you don\u2019t have a Mastodon account yet, you should get yourself set it up with one. It\u2019s not as daunting as some people make it out to be. Check out our beginner\u2019s guide to Mastodon to learn how. 1. Log in to Buffer and connect Mastodon as a channel If you\u2019ve already got an account, getting it connected to Buffer is your first step. Log in to Buffer and go to the channel connection page . Mastodon will be one of the new options. 2. Choose your server After choosing to connect a Mastodon channel, you\u2019ll be prompted to choose a server. Buffer automatically suggests some of the more popular servers, but if your profile is on a server not on the list, you can choose the \u201cOther\u201d option and manually type the server address. 3. Authorize Buffer on Mastodon From there, you\u2019ll be taken through an authorization flow and in a few clicks you\u2019ll be all set to start scheduling posts from Buffer to Mastodon. 4. Start scheduling out your posts This is where the fun starts; it's time to start creating and scheduling content for Mastodon. In Buffer, you can create content for any of your connected channels using the composer. Here\u2019s a short demo video highlighting how easy it is to create content for Mastodon. And here are a few tips for creating a Mastodon post using Buffer. Each post can contain up to 500 characters. Some instances allow for more characters but this is the default limit . You can include links and no matter how long the link is, it will count as 23 characters so there is no need to use a link shortener to save characters. In fact, using a link shortener is actively discouraged . You can mention users by typing out their full address, e.g. @alice@example.com. Note that any usage of @word will be interpreted as mentioning the local user with that handle, if that user exists. Only the username part will count against your character limit \u2013 the domain is not counted. You can use a #hashtag to make your post discoverable to anyone searching for that hashtag. Hashtags can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, but cannot contain numbers only. You can add images up to 8MB in size and up to four images can be attached to a post. You can upload a single video or GIF (GIFs are converted to soundless videos). Using the Hashtag Manager in Buffer Hashtags are a great way to improve discoverability on Mastodon and with Buffer\u2019s hashtag manager you can save groups of hashtags and insert them into your Mastodon post with a single click. Scheduling with Buffer\u2019s iOS and Android apps If you like to schedule your content on the go, you can use Buffer\u2019s iOS and Android apps to post to Mastodon. Here\u2019s a quick video showing how it works. The hashtag manager is also available on our mobile apps. Feedback and what\u2019s coming next It was super fun to build this integration in partnership with some very supportive and generous beta testers. They helped us iron out bugs, better understand the Mastodon platform, and improve the user experience before launch. We feel very lucky to have a community that is just as excited about this as we are! And now that we've launched V1, we're already starting to think about how we can add more power to our Mastodon integration. Scheduling boosts? Analytics? These are some of the requests from our beta community. What do you think? How can we make Buffer for Mastodon even better? We\u2019d love to hear from you. You can connect with us on Mastodon at https://mastodon.world/@buffer (we\u2019d really appreciate a follow!) or you can find us at all the other usual places.

      "content_text": "Influencers have become powerful voices in shaping consumer behavior and brand perception. In a report by CreatorIQ , 55 percent of TikTok users state that they trust a brand more when it's shared by a creator \u2013 and we can assume the same rings true for other platforms. Data like this proves that influencer marketing is a valuable strategy for brands looking to reach a large, engaged audience. Now, the terms \u201cinfluencer\u201d and \u201ccreator\u201d are often used interchangeably and for good reason. While they are somewhat different, either will work for a marketing campaign, as they both likely partner with brands. So whichever camp you fall into \u2014 whether you're a brand seeking advice on how to find the right person to amplify your message or a budding influencer/creator researching how to get in front of brands \u2014 this article is for you. We'll explore the key steps in identifying, evaluating, and collaborating with influencers to ensure your marketing campaign achieves its goals. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear roadmap to harness the power of influencer marketing effectively. 6 places to find influencers or creators Finding the right influencers or creators for your marketing campaign is crucial for its success. Here\u2019s a detailed guide to help brands and influencers alike in their search. 1. Start by searching on social media Social media platforms are a goldmine for finding potential influencers and creators. Here are some tips for using social media: Check relevant hashtags : Search for hashtags related to your industry or campaign theme. For example, watch brand Breda Studio would benefit from searching hashtags like #watchtok or #womenswatches to find relevant TikTok creators\u200b. Explore influencer directories : Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have directories where you can start your search and find popular and trending influencers in various niches. Use analytics and social listening tools : Start from SocialBlade to find in-depth analytics on influencers, helping you track their growth, engagement rates, and overall influence\u200b. Then, use BuzzSumo or Sparktoro to identify popular content in your niche and the influencers who share it. This can help you find influencers already engaged with topics relevant to your brand. Of course, verify the authenticity of influencers' followers and engagement. Look out for signs of fake followers or engagement bots, and ensure the influencer\u2019s audience aligns with your target market\u200b. 2. Find the right influencer marketing platform Influencer marketing platforms and tools are a great way to discover and evaluate potential influencers, and choosing the right one can streamline the process of finding and managing influencers. A lot of them are \u201cdone for you,\u201d with application processes, teams, and technology sorting the most ideal partners for you. They typically provide insights into influencer metrics, audience demographics, and engagement rates, helping you make informed decisions\u200b. Here are some platforms to consider: HashtagPaid : Known for its authenticity and quality, HashtagPaid connects brands with influencers who create genuine content that resonates with audiences\u200b. Grin : Ideal for e-commerce brands, Grin offers a comprehensive suite of tools for managing influencer campaigns, from discovery to reporting\u200b. inBeat : Perfect for small to medium-sized businesses, inBeat specializes in connecting brands with micro- and nano-influencers to drive engagement and conversions\u200b. Passionfroot : If you\u2019re on the hunt for creators specifically, Passionfroot is the place to be. The platform focuses on helping brands build long-term relationships with creators, making it ideal for brands looking to create ongoing partnerships\u200b. Influence.co : With Influence.co , you can search for influencers by industry, location, and social media platform, making it easier to find the right match for your campaign\u200b. 3. Follow industry media platforms Staying updated with industry news and trends can help you discover influencers who are gaining traction. Here\u2019s how: Podcasts : Listen to industry-specific podcasts where influencers are often featured as guests. These can provide insights into their personalities and reach. Newsletters : Subscribe to newsletters that cover your industry\u2019s latest trends and influential figures. These often highlight up-and-coming influencers. Websites : Regularly visit websites and blogs that focus on your industry. They often feature interviews or articles about key influencers. My version of this for work is the Creator Science podcast, the Passionfruit newsletter, and the Business Insider \u201cCreator Economy\u201d tag. 4. Check your competitors Analyzing your competitors can give you a look at effective (and ineffective) influencer strategies. Look at the influencers your competitors are working with and analyze the type of content they create and the engagement they receive\u200b. Dig deeper to find who these influencers follow and engage with to lead you to other potential partners. Tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs can be useful for tracking your competitors\u2019 influencer campaigns and providing insights into successful strategies and potential influencers to consider\u200b. 5. Participate in industry events Well-attended industry conferences (online or offline) where influencers might speak or participate can be a great resource for discovery. These events can be a great opportunity to network and identify potential collaborators. Engage in X Spaces, TikTok Lives , or LinkedIn Audio Events relevant to your industry. Creators often participate in these events, providing a chance to connect directly\u200b 6. Ask your community Your community can be a great resource \u2013 and is probably your best resource \u2013 for finding influencers to work with. Engage with them on social media or through email newsletters, asking them to recommend their favorite influencers. This can help you find creators who already resonate with your target audience\u200b. Alternatively, I suggest identifying active community members who consistently create content related to your brand. These loyal followers can become powerful brand ambassadors and create authentic user-generated content\u200b . Best practices for working with influencers Before diving into influencer discovery, it's crucial to lay a strong foundation for your campaign. Here are some tips on what you need to do before you even start your search: Determine the type of influencer you want to work with Before you take any steps, you need to decide what type of influencer you need as a partner. Here\u2019s how they\u2019re currently categorized: Nano (1,000 to 10,000 followers) : Although they may have smaller audiences, their followers are often highly engaged and trust their recommendations deeply. This makes nano creators ideal for brands looking to target niche markets and foster authentic connections with their audience. Most beginner creators fall into this category. Micro (10,000 and 100,000 followers) : They strike a balance between reach and engagement, often boasting higher interaction rates than larger creators. Microcreators are perfect for brands aiming to reach a decent-sized audience while still maintaining a sense of authenticity and personal connection. Macro (100,000 to 1 million followers) : They have a significant reach and can generate substantial visibility for brands. While their engagement rates might be lower compared to nano and micro creators, macro creators are effective for campaigns that require broad exposure and brand awareness. Mega (1 million+ followers) : Mega creators, also known as celebrity influencers, offer unparalleled reach and can drive massive awareness for brands. However, collaborations with these creators often come with higher costs and may result in less personalized engagement. Mega creators are best suited for large-scale campaigns with significant budgets aiming for maximum visibility. Your Mr. Beasts and MKBHDs fall under this category. Audience size isn\u2019t the only thing that changes with each category \u2014 pricing also varies wildly. However, there is a lot more nuance when it comes to how much a creator might charge, depending on campaign requirements, past partnerships, experience, and so much more. Consider your audience, campaign goals, and budget to determine the right type of influencer for your brand\u200b. \ud83d\udca1 To get a better idea of what creators might include in their rate cards, check out How to Create Your Own Influencer Media Kit (+ Examples from Creators) .

      "content_text": "I recently wrote about hitting 20,000 followers on LinkedIn and what comes next. In that article, I shared that Threads would be my next frontier, and now, I want to share why and how I plan to make it so. After years of posting within a structured framework on LinkedIn, I started wondering what would happen if I loosened the rules. I\u2019ve tested formats , frequency , and monetization , but always through the lens of performance. I didn\u2019t want to move into a new phase of growth using the same tactics. What if I treated content less like a system to optimize and more like a sandbox to play in? And so, the Proof of Concept series was born, and with it, my first experiment: growing from 366 to 1,000 followers on Threads in three months through organic effort, curiosity, and consistency. Unlike LinkedIn, Threads still feels like an open field. The playbook isn\u2019t written yet. Posts travel less by polish and more by presence \u2014 by joining conversations, responding quickly, and showing up like a person, not a brand. It\u2019s the perfect place to relearn what experimentation feels like. Why Threads (and why now)? LinkedIn taught me how to build authority; Threads is where I\u2019m trying to reclaim my creativity. Threads feels like a reset \u2014 informal enough to experiment without overthinking, yet active enough to test ideas fast. Plus, Threads mirrors where social media is heading: toward smaller, faster spaces that reward participation over perfection. I\u2019m tapping into the excitement around Threads from other creators who are actively growing on the platform. View on Threads I don\u2019t know yet who my Threads audience will be, but that\u2019s part of the appeal. I want to experiment across my interests \u2014 from remote work to brand partnerships to the simple aesthetic things I take pleasure in every day (like sharing my lunches or pictures from my travels). This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019m using Threads as a testing ground, either. The last time I focused on the platform nearly a year ago \u2014 which I documented in this article \u2014 I learned a lot about the power of conversation on the platform. This time around, I\u2019m not aiming for virality, just testing what happens when I post like myself without the pressure of showing expertise. \u26a1Much of the advice in How to Get More Followers on Threads is powering my approach, so I recommend you check out the article! Setting the ground rules Despite the lack of structure in my actual posts, the experiment needs some guardrails and milestones. So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve landed on: Follower starting point: 366 followers on Threads (431 as of writing this article) Goal: Reach 1,000 by December 15, 2025. Cadence: One scheduled post every day (powered by our best time to post data , of course), plus spontaneous posts when inspiration hits. Focus: 100% organic \u2014 no ads, no follow-for-follow, no automation. Time investment: About 20 minutes daily, split between writing, posting, and engaging with others. Measurement: Weekly check-ins on follower growth, replies per post, and conversation quality (not just likes). Beyond the numbers, I\u2019ll also track how it feels \u2014 whether posting this way sparks joy or starts to feel like an obligation. The plan Threads isn\u2019t a place for perfect niches. It rewards multidimensional creators who show up as themselves \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what I plan to lean into. Determine my content pillars Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll post about: Remote work: Reflections, tools, and habits from working globally. Life as a beginner content creator: Documenting my growth on Threads in real time. LinkedIn content creation: Lessons I\u2019m translating from a more polished platform. Creator growth: Experiments, learnings, and what consistency actually builds. Content marketing: Behind-the-scenes from Buffer \u2014 frameworks, campaigns, and storytelling. Brand partnerships: What I\u2019ve learned from collaborations, approvals, and creative briefs. Productivity: Systems, fitness, and routines that make all of the above possible. \u26a1\u00a0I documented my approach to figuring out content pillars in How To Create Content Pillars For Social Media Commit to a daily rhythm of scheduled and spontaneous posts Structure keeps me consistent**,** while flexibility keeps me creative. So I\u2019m mixing both \u2014 one scheduled post daily (anchored in my content pillars) and spontaneous posts whenever inspiration strikes. Scheduled posts: Keeps me grounded with a consistent rhythm of insights and reflections. Spontaneous posts: Keeps me curious \u2014 quick thoughts, visuals, or random questions that spark conversations. Engagement as a growth lever Threads runs on conversation, not broadcasting \u2014 so engagement is the real growth engine. Here\u2019s my approach: Join 5 to 10 conversations daily: Add thoughtful comments and questions that move discussions forward. Prioritize replies over reach: Comments drive discovery, so I\u2019ll respond to every meaningful reply. Use tags intentionally: Explore and contribute to relevant communities through tags like #RemoteWork or #Creators. Cross-promote with care: Share standout Threads moments to Instagram or LinkedIn to invite deeper connection. Collaborate naturally: Co-create ideas with other creators or build off shared themes in public. If my LinkedIn growth came from consistency, I suspect Threads growth will come from curiosity. The month-by-month approach Month 1: Discovery This month is about exploration. I\u2019ll post daily across all my pillars, track which formats and topics gain traction, and start identifying patterns \u2014 the kind of content that sparks replies, shares, or follows. By the end of the month, I want a clearer sense of my audience, top-performing topics, and ideal posting times. Goal : reach 500 to 600 followers, but more importantly, gather enough data to refine my focus. Month 2: Refinement This is where I\u2019ll narrow in. I\u2019ll double down on the pillars that resonated most in Month 1 and start introducing recurring formats. Maybe a weekly \u201cThreads Journal\u201d where I reflect on growth lessons, or a recurring visual series tied to my lifestyle posts. I\u2019ll also lean into conversations \u2014 replying to other creators more intentionally, joining trends, and testing features like polls or tags more actively. Goal : reach 800 followers and establish a recognizable content rhythm. Month 3: Acceleration By Month 3, the goal is to scale what works. That means doubling down on proven formats, collaborating with others, and sharing meta-reflections about the journey \u2014 the very posts that will later become How I Grew to 1,000 Followers on Threads. I\u2019ll experiment with \u201copen thread\u201d prompts to build community (\u201cDrop your current content challenge \u2014 I\u2019ll share what\u2019s working for me\u201d) and test cross-platform engagement by sharing a few of my best Threads moments elsewhere. Goal : hit 1,000 followers \u2014 and capture the insights that matter most for the next Proof of Concept installment. Anticipated challenges Every experiment sounds neat on paper. The real test is what happens in week three, when the novelty wears off and the algorithms start behaving differently. A few things I\u2019m already anticipating: Creative fatigue. Posting daily will test my ability to stay inspired. I\u2019m planning to batch-write a few posts during high-energy days, so I have something to fall back on when I\u2019m not feeling as creative. Finding my Threads \u201cvoice.\u201d On LinkedIn, I know exactly how to write for that audience. Threads feels looser \u2014 less professional, more conversational \u2014 and it\u2019ll take some trial and error to find the right rhythm. Balancing work and play. Because I also write about social media for Buffer, the line between experimenting and analyzing can blur quickly. I want to protect this space as a creative outlet, not a content lab. Platform unpredictability. Threads is still evolving. Features shift and visibility fluctuates (courtesy of The Algorithm). My goal is to stay adaptable and treat every change as another data point in the experiment. What I\u2019m hoping to learn Every platform teaches you something new about being a creator. LinkedIn taught me the value of structure and consistency. Threads, I hope, will teach me how to stay creative without overthinking \u2014 to post from curiosity, not performance. I want to see what happens when growth isn\u2019t engineered but discovered in real time. Through this experiment, I\u2019m looking to understand: Which types of posts invite genuine conversation, not just engagement. How different formats \u2014 text, visuals, and video \u2014 thrive in a more experimental ecosystem. Whether consistency still wins when creativity leads. How community on Threads grows differently from LinkedIn \u2014 slower, deeper, or just more human. When I hit 20,000 followers on LinkedIn, it felt like the end of one story \u2014 proof that deliberate systems work. Starting over on Threads feels like the beginning of another: a reminder that expertise is only valuable if you\u2019re still willing to be a beginner. Curiosity and experimentation built my first audience. I hope to tap into that feeling again \u2014 posting without pressure, learning in public, and rediscovering the fun in showing up just because I want to. If you want to follow along, you can find me on Threads @ tamioladipo . I\u2019ll be sharing updates \u2014 the wins, the misses, and the metrics \u2014 as I try to grow to 1,000 followers by the end of the year.

      "content_text": "There\u2019s no two ways about it: video is the way people prefer to consume content in 2025. Buffer\u2019s data shows that when it comes to social media platforms video outperforms every other type of content by a landslide \u2014 and that\u2019s on all platforms. Whether you\u2019re a social media marketer, content creator, or influencer, video content should be a key part of your growth and marketing strategy . Of course, that\u2019s easier said than done. Video creation requires a lot more input (though the proof really is in the pudding). Often, the biggest hurdle to overcome is video editing \u2014 but in 2025, there\u2019s really no reason to let this block you. Thanks to the incredible variety of free video editing software options on the market, editing your videos is now easier than ever. Thanks to templates, transcript editing, AI , and a host of other nifty features, editing your videos can now be \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 fun! With all that in mind, here\u2019s a guide to the best video editing software for creators, marketers, and small business owners. I've curated separate lists of paid and free video editors, though, in many cases, the tools offer both limited free versions and more feature-rich paid versions. Only the tools with substantial free offerings are included in the free video editing software list. Many of these tools also come with advanced features that cater to both beginners and professionals, so there's a suitable option here no matter your skill level. Let's dig in. \ud83d\ude80 Give your videos the best possible chance of success \u2014 schedule them videos across multiple platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, in one go with Buffer. Here's how \u2192 Best free video editing software Most of the video editors in this list do have paid plans that come with additional benefits, but they made this list because their free plans are comprehensive and powerful \u2014 so you don\u2019t need to spend a cent to use them. Some of these tools are completely free, offering a full suite of features without any restrictions or watermarks. 1. CapCut It still breaks my brain a little that most of CapCut\u2019s best features are 100 percent free. With both a powerful app, browser, and desktop version that it\u2019s relatively easy to toggle between, CapCut is a no-brainer if you\u2019re creating videos for social media. In my experience, it\u2019s the best video editing software for beginner to intermediate editors. The mostly free video editor is especially handy for TikTok . The two apps pair beautifully, thanks to the fact that they\u2019re both owned by ByteDance. You can even add some trending TikTok sounds right in CapCut before exporting or sharing directly to TikTok (you\u2019ll just need to save the audio in TikTok and log into CapCut with your TikTok account). As far as I know, it's the only free video editor that allows this. When it comes to editing itself, CapCut is intuitive and easy to learn. It offers an eye-popping variety of fonts, effects, stickers, and transitions to choose from, along with a superb caption auto generator. More advanced users will love CapCut, too, thanks to some really in-depth editing options like voice isolation and enhancements, color adjustments, and more. Note that some of these features are only available on the paid plan, but at $7.99 per month, it\u2019s still one of the more affordable options out there. Pro tip: I find video editing a little easier to do on my computer than on my phone, but if you go that route, do go the extra mile and download the desktop version of CapCut to access all the best features. CapCut\u2019s online video editor isn\u2019t quite as powerful and user-friendly. Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $9.99 per month 2. Clipchamp Create Clipchamp Create , which replaced Windows Movie Maker, is one of the most generous free online video editing tools I\u2019ve found in my research. If you have a Windows PC, you\u2019ll find the free video editing software pre-downloaded on your computer. If you\u2019re a Mac user, fear not \u2014 you can use it in your browser. The free plan lets you create unlimited video projects, gives you access to all basic editing tools, and allows you to export your videos in 480p output resolution without a watermark. (A watermark will be present if you use stock footage, though.) You could upgrade to Premium or higher to gain access to its stock library and download your videos at better resolutions. If you\u2019re recording voiceovers or filming yourself, Clipchamp\u2019s Speaker Coach is a unique plus. It\u2019ll help you track your pace, pitch, and filler words and offer tips and tricks to improve your presentation skills. Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $9 per month. 3. Canva For simple edits, Canva is one of the best free video editing software options out there. What the video editor lacks in editing capabilities, it makes up for in beautiful, ready-made video templates. The clip editing itself in Canva is basic \u2014 you can trip, cut, and rearrange videos, but not layer things over each other (if, say, you wanted to split the audio from your video track and use it as a voiceover). Still, there\u2019s probably a template ready and waiting in their vast template library that will be a good fit for your project. Adding your own photos or clips is as simple as dragging and dropping them into the editor. This tool is great, a fuss-free option for beginner video editors, and is particularly handy if you\u2019re looking to turn some photos into a video. Price: Free plan, with paid options starting at $15 per user per month. 4. DaVinci Resolve If you\u2019re looking for a tool to create great TikToks, Shorts, or Reels, DaVinci Resolve is probably not for you. But if you\u2019re looking to create super slick, high-production videos for YouTube or even create your own documentary (why not?), DaVinci Resolve is tough to beat. There\u2019s a reason this free video editor is a favorite of both professional YouTubers and Hollywood producers \u2014 or rather, many reasons: it combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics, and audio post-production in a single tool. While this particular free video editing software is not as easy to learn as, say, Canva, DaVinci Resolve is relatively user-friendly. If you\u2019re a marketer or creator looking to add \u2018professional video editing\u2019 to your skillset, a couple of hours playing around with Resolve will be time well spent. And yes, I did say free. Some DaVinci Resolve features are exclusive to their paid \u2018Studio\u2019 plan, though most will only be necessary for entire production teams. Also, you\u2019ll only be able to export videos in Ultra HD for free. Still, that means a whopping 3840 x 2610 \u2014 much higher than most of the free video editors on this list. That said, DaVinci Resolve is a hefty program and will require a decent computer to run. For Windows, that means at least Windows 10, 16GB of memory, and an integrated GPU. On Mac, that\u2019s MacOS 11 or higher, 8GB system memory, and an integrated GPU. Price: Free. The more advanced paid version, Davinci Resolve Studio, costs $295. 5. Adobe Creative Cloud Express Photo: Adobe.com Adobe Express (formerly Adobe Spark) provides multiple storyboards, layouts, and themes to help you create amazing videos. The largely free video editor is a powerful Canva alternative (and it pairs well with one of my favorite free AI image generators, Adobe Firefly, which is a point in its favor). Like Canva, templates are the name of the game here, and video layering options are limited. However, the template options are varied and unique and won\u2019t have that tell-tale \u201cI made this in Canva\u201d feel some folks will know all too well. Some premium templates, stock photos, and videos will only be available on the paid plan (though you can use them if you don\u2019t mind exporting with a watermark). Price: Free, with paid plans starting at $11.99 monthly. 6. Descript Descript is the video editing tool that works like a text editor (seriously, if you hate editing videos, give this one a bash.) Descript was one of the first video editing software options to market with transcript-based editing. In a nutshell, this means Descript auto-generates a transcript for your video, which you can then edit as if you were working on a text document. Whatever text you delete, trim, or move around reflects in the video file, too. Neat, right? It can take a bit of practice to get right, but it\u2019s great when it comes to editing chatter-heavy videos and audio files, this can be a huge time-saver.\u00a0In my opinion, Descript is one of the best video editing software for podcasts. Technically, you can use some of Descript\u2019s best features for free. With its $0 per month starter plan, you can edit up to 60 minutes of content and remove filler words, but you\u2019ll only be able to export one video without a watermark per month. Price: Limited free plan, with paid options starting at $19 per month. 7. iMovie iMovie is Apple\u2019s native video editor, available for free on Macs, iPhones, and iPads. It\u2019s a great entry-level option, and what it lacks in advanced editing capabilities, it makes up for with pure ease of use. \u2018Storyboards\u2019 mode offers a selection of templates with styles based on your use case \u2014 think things like \u201cGaming,\u201d Makeover,\u201d or \u201cQ&A\u201d\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0and even a Magic Movie mode, which will automatically turn your photos into a movie in seconds. If you\u2019re a complete beginner and a bit intimidated by video editing tools, it might be worthwhile to play around with iMovie before moving on to one of the more robust options on this list. Price: Free on Mac and iOS. \u26a1 On the hunt for more AI features? Check out our list of the best AI video editors . Best paid video editing software Once again, you'll find some options on this list that do have free plans, though I found their paid options worth paying for. 1. CapCut Pro Capcut again? Sorry, I just had to. Capcut's Pro plan makes it one of the best video editing software options. The paid version of the video editor grants users access to an expanded library of fonts, animations, and other effe",

Ogilvy's Creative Director, David Raichman, called AI \u201c a force multiplier for creative expression,\u201d and I couldn't agree more.

      "content_text": "Question: I\u2019ve recently started an email newsletter but haven\u2019t been receiving as many subscribers as I hoped. Do you have any tips on how I can drive up awareness and get more people to subscribe? Newsletters have made quite the comeback. While it\u2019s true that email marketing has always been an important tool for business growth, in recent years the popularity of platforms like Substack has made it clear that this medium is in demand. In fact, the newsletter company recently hit over 1 million paid subscribers and is still growing five years later. The appeal of newsletters is understandable given that email is an owned channel which makes it an incredibly powerful medium, as it\u2019s one of the most direct and reliable channels to reach your audience. You may have your very own newsletter and are hoping to grow it. In this #AskBuffer, we\u2019ll cover the best practices for gaining more subscribers and also give examples from successful newsletters. As a bonus, we\u2019ll provide a glimpse into our social media newsletter here at Buffer and take a look at how we recently revamped it. 7 ways to grow your newsletter subscribers Newsletters are one way to reach your audience directly in a format that has worked for a long time now. Growing an email newsletter can be challenging, though, so here are some tactics you can use to grow your newsletter subscribers. 1. Create great content that people are interested in This may sound a bit obvious, but to get more email subscribers you need to be creating content that your followers want to see. Most people already have jam-packed inboxes, so you need to incentivize them and prove that your newsletter is worth them receiving one extra email. When you\u2019re brainstorming topics for your newsletter, make sure to hit the key topics that interest your audience the most. We\u2019ve talked about content pillars on the blog before, and they\u2019re basically core themes that you always revolve your content around. Establish content pillars for your newsletters that you know will resonate with your community. If you already have a following on social media, you can just pull from your prior posts. Influencer and small business owner Alison Wu recently told her Instagram community that she will be pulling back from the platform and focusing more of her attention on her new Stubstack email newsletter. In a post announcing the news, Alison detailed the exact content she\u2019ll be releasing, including: Self-care and health Spirituality, mindfulness, and personal growth Travel, place, and spaces Style, objects, and visuals View this post on Instagram A post shared by alison wu || wu haus (@alison__wu) In her caption, the influencer advertises her newsletter as a way to connect with her, \u201caway from the white noise of Instagram.\u201d This establishes her newsletter as a more intimate environment where followers can connect with her. It also differentiates Alison\u2019s Substack from her Instagram \u2013 which can give some people the extra push to subscribe to her on another platform. Make sure your newsletter content is relatable, entertaining, and valuable to your followers. And consider giving your audience a more detailed preview of what to expect. The Morning Brew , a business newsletter, sends all of their subscribers this summary once they've opted in, along with providing other resources readers would be interested in. You could also distribute this information on social media before your followers subscribe, as a way to drum up some interest for your newsletter. Morning Brew's message to new subscribers 2. Cover timely topics Some of the most successful newsletters are not only sent out regularly but also make sure to cover news and trends promptly. After all, if you are hoping to be a newsletter that people are excited about, you should be offering the latest coverage on what\u2019s happening in your industry. We\u2019ve found at Buffer that whenever we cover timely topics \u2013 like this Mastodon article we published after Elon Musk took over Twitter \u2013 we get more traffic than usual on our blog. The same can happen for your newsletter if you\u2019re discussing trending topics . Here are a few examples of popular newsletters written by individuals who have their fingers on the pulse in their fields of expertise. Geekout Newsletter covers trending tech news Marketer Matt Navarra is always breaking down the latest tech and marketing news \u2013 like his timely newsletter about ChatGPT and the potential it has to disrupt the job market. He is also covering the latest social media news and was quick to cover Twitter when Elon Musk became CEO. ChatGPT has been dominating the headlines recently, and Matt made sure to include the topic in his newsletter and addressed all of the hype around it. Matt's newsletter Geekout Culture Study covers the latest happening in today\u2019s culture Journalist and culture writer Anne Helen Petersen runs a popular newsletter Culture Study where she discusses the latest cultural news. Anne writes about a variety of topics, covering social, political, and economic matters. Her most recent newsletter discusses the recent tech and media layoffs \u2013 a topic relevant for many Americans who were impacted or feared they may soon be laid off. Anne's recent newsletter on layoffs Hung Up covers the latest pop culture news Hunter Harris\u2019s popular newsletter Hung Up covers the latest in entertainment news. While Hunter usually sends out a newsletter every Friday, she sent out an extra email the day after the Academy Awards nominations were announced. Hunter's latest newsletter covers the Oscar nominations Including the latest discourse in your newsletter will ensure that you\u2019re talking about topics that will resonate with your readers. 3. Promote your newsletter across other channels Once you\u2019ve packed your newsletter with the latest and greatest info, it\u2019s time to promote it to make sure readers are aware of it. Here are a few ways to highlight your newsletter. Include a CTA on your website Include a clear CTA (call to action) for readers to subscribe to your newsletter on your website. Our newsletter CTA appears in the middle of our blog homepage. Our newsletter CTA is in the middle of our blog page There are a few different options you can play with when placing your CTA. Writer and entrepreneur Kat Boogard includes her newsletter CTA at the bottom of her website\u2019s homepage. Kat's CTA is at the bottom of her website's homepage Her CTA is clear and appealing: \u201cGet freelance advice and job leads directly to your inbox.\u201d In one quick sentence, Kat tells her subscribers exactly what they\u2019ll receive. Some websites have a pop-up that advertises their newsletters. While popups can be successful, users may find some of them a bit jarring, so make sure yours isn\u2019t too big or too difficult to close out. Sri Lankan tea brand Kola Goodies\u2019 website includes a pop-up for their newsletter. Their CTA offers an incentive as well: 15 percent off for users who subscribe. Include your newsletter in your social media bios and links-in-bio tools Don't forget to add your newsletter in your social media bios or as the main link in your profile. This way you\u2019re spreading the word about your newsletter to all of your online community, wherever they happen to be. Content Creator Emily Mariko includes a direct link to her newsletter on her Instagram bio. If you're a Buffer Start Page user with a Mailchimp newsletter, your new subscribers can sign up directly on your Start Page. By using this integration, you're removing the friction of signing up to maximize your chances of gaining a new subscriber. Here's how to use it . \ud83d\udca1 Start Page is the perfect link-in-bio tool for your online brand or small business. Make yours for free . Post snippets of your newsletter on your Instagram Stories, Twitter, and LinkedIn We recommend repurposing your newsletter into other content \u2013 like a LinkedIn post, tweet, or blog post. Repurposing content allows you to extend the life of a certain work and is a great way to get more eyes on your posts. Instead of just sending out your newsletter to email subscribers, teasing snippets of it onto your social media channels will increase brand awareness. Once you do this, you can link back to your newsletter and include a CTA for your followers to subscribe. In a Twitter thread, Jack Appleby discussed why brands should be utilizing both Instagram and TikTok. At the end of the thread, he shared that this information is all in his newsletter, Future Social , and linked back to it. If your brand is on Instagram, your brand should be on TikTok, too. \ud83e\uddf5: \u2014 Jack Appleby \u2615\ufe0f (@jappleby) January 30, 2023 This all comes from my free weekly newsletter, Future Social, where I break down social media + creator strategies every week. You can sub to that right over here: https://t.co/RFo99kspVg \u2014 Jack Appleby \u2615\ufe0f (@jappleby) January 30, 2023 If done properly, posting about your newsletter on social media can definitely increase the number of your subscribers. Phil , Buffer\u2019s Senior Product Marketer, wrote a blog post on how one of our users, Dave, increased his newsletter traffic by 2.5x just by using Buffer to schedule his social media posts. Learn how he was able to grow his newsletter here. \ud83d\udca1 Twitter Threads make a great format for promoting newsletter content.

Offer bonuses to subscribers Creating a newsletter that is entertaining and informative for your readers is your best bet to gaining subscribers, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to offer some bonuses that'll provide some extra value for your online community. Many brands provide exclusive perks to their email subscriber lists, including discounts and early access to certain products. Here, lifestyle brand Janet Gwen gives their email subscribers an extra 25 percent off on their website. Janet Gwen offers exclusive discounts to their email subscribers You can also offer your subscribers other worthwhile items, including an e-book filled wi",

      "content_text": "Let me guess. You've got big marketing dreams but a not-so-big budget? I've been there. After 12 years of marketing for bootstrapped brands, I've learned that you don't need to spend a fortune on fancy digital marketing tools to see results. It's all about building a smart toolkit that punches above its weight. One that helps you work efficiently and get results without breaking the bank. Enter: this handy, comprehensive list of 29 essential digital marketing tools that help growing brands succeed \u2014 many of which I\u2019ve used as a professional marketer. A lot of these marketing software offer free or low-cost versions. So you can start small and scale up as you're ready for more features. Think of this as your cheat sheet for building a powerful marketing tech stack on a budget. Social media marketing tools Partnership marketing tools Email and SMS marketing tools SEO (search engine optimization) tools Content and design tools for marketers Conversion optimization tools Paid advertising tools Marketing analytics tools Build your digital marketing stack one tool at a time Social media marketing tools These nifty social media tools help you maintain a consistent social media presence and evaluate your content performance. Buffer: Social media management for creators and small businesses A social media management tool is central to any social strategy. It helps you manage your online presence so you can post consistently and on a schedule you choose \u2014 which can help improve engagement . And since this is the Buffer blog, you\u2019ll forgive us for being a little biased, right? \ud83d\ude09 I've been a Buffer customer and fan for nine years, long before I started contributing to the blog. And, when I became more active in building my personal brand a year ago, Buffer was the natural choice. The good stuff: Capture and organize all your social media ideas in the Create space Schedule finished posts in your social queue. The AI assistant helps you generate ideas, repurpose content, and edit posts to perfection. Buffer's Start Page lets you create polished link-in-bio landing pages in minutes. Track and respond to Facebook and Instagram comments in a streamlined dashboard that auto-flags high-priority comments. The Create space is one of my favorite features. Here's my current setup: I log all my half-baked ideas here and move them along in my custom Kanban board as they progress. I even have a prompts category for ideas in case I get stuck (many of which came from Buffer's Creator Camp ) \u2014 but there's a nifty \"generate ideas\" button that can jumpstart your content creation. From here, adding a finished post to my queue for publishing is super easy. And with Buffer's pay-by-channel pricing model, I've been able to scale the services I pay for up and down based on what I need. For example, I used to be active on both LinkedIn and X, now I'm only on LinkedIn. That flexibility is helpful since every dollar counts as I grow my freelance business. Plus, if you're experimenting with newer platform options, Buffer quickly adds support for new social platforms (hello, Mastodon and Bluesky !). Buffer shines brightest for small businesses, solopreneurs, and creators looking to streamline their social media game without getting lost in complex features. It's the perfect balance of powerful and user-friendly \u2014 just what you need to make your social media presence pop without the headache. Pricing: Free plan available.

Many social listening tools cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for small businesses. But Mentionlytics brings these powerful capabilities to small businesses at a fraction of the cost.

Predis.ai: Competitor analysis for social media Source: Predis.ai Ultimately, you'll want to differentiate your social media marketing strategy from your competitors', so you don't want to copy them. But checking out what they're doing with a competitive analysis tool can help you understand their strategy and inform your own. Predis.ai surfaces these insights and can even help you generate content based on what's working in your industry. The good stuff: Decode your competitors' social media strategies on select social platforms (they're building out support for more networks as we speak). Get the scoop on which posts are hitting home runs and which are striking out for your competition. Understand content distribution patterns to time your posts for maximum impact. Uncover the hashtag strategies your competitors are using to boost their reach. Generate AI-powered posts based on what's working in your niche.

However, managing these relationships can get a bit fiddly if you rely on spreadsheets and email threads. These digital marketing tools can help you track relationships, streamline outreach, manage campaigns, and measure the impact of your collaborations. ShareASale: Simple affiliate marketing management Source: ShareASale Affiliate marketing is a great avenue for partnerships on a budget. In standard affiliate partnership deals, you only pay your partners when they refer a customer who buys your product. So you don't have to risk paying upfront when you're not sure whether the partnership will work. I've run affiliate marketing for three different brands, and two of them started on ShareASale \u2014 and I wished the third one did too. I find ShareASale to be a great launchpad for brands getting into affiliate marketing for the first time. The good stuff: It has a low barrier to entry and a simple self-service interface. You can set up affiliate signup pages to recruit partners quickly. Customizable commission settings let you tailor your offers to individual partners.

Then, $35 monthly, plus 20 percent of affiliate commissions.

Pricing: Starts at $198/month. Buzzstream: PR relationship management Source: Buzzstream In the five years I spent managing partnerships at Tortuga , I can't recommend using a CRM for partnerships enough. I used Buzzstream to track brand features and outreach of all kinds, including those with media, bloggers, product review sites, influencers, and affiliates. The good stuff: Manage relationships with a wide range of partners all in one place. Track and automate your outreach campaigns so no important follow-up falls through the cracks. Monitor brand mentions across the web to stay on top of your brand awareness game and link-building efforts. If you manage many partnerships for your brand, Buzzstream can help you keep all ",

      "content_text": "I create video content for Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn, so I\u2019m always looking for new tools to make the process smoother \u2014 and I may just have found my new favorite. Instagram has just launched their brand-new video editing app, Edits by Instagram , and it\u2019s already way surpassed my expectations. If you\u2019ve ever tried to edit a reel with Instagram\u2019s native video editing tools, you\u2019ll know why I was a bit skeptical. Optimistic, but skeptical. But Edits has not disappointed. The new app is lightyears ahead of Instagram\u2019s built-in editing capabilities \u2014 which makes sense, given that this new app is meant to rival CapCut, the Swiss Army knife of video editing tools . Edits is sleek, powerful, and surprisingly easy to use. I suspect that anyone creating content on mobile will really enjoy this (completely free!) app \u2014 whether you\u2019re a video veteran or just starting out. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instagram\u2019s @Creators (@creators) After some serious hands-on time with Edits by Instagram, here\u2019s my everything guide, from getting started to tips and tricks to take you to the next level. How to use Instagram Edits: The basics Before we get into the tips, here\u2019s a quick crash course in using Edits. Step 1: Download + sign in Head to the **App Store or Google Play **, search for \u201cInstagram Edits ,\u201d and download the app. Then, log in using your Instagram account \u2014 no new profile is needed. Step 2: Create a project Once you\u2019re in, you can either record directly in the app (up to 10 minutes of footage) or upload existing clips from your camera roll. Handy if you\u2019re editing on the go or batch-shooting for later. To add media from your camera roll, tap the \u2018 + \u2019 button on the bottom right of the app. To record your own footage right in Edits, tap the \u2018record\u2019 button on the bottom menu bar. \u26a1\ufe0f Pro tip: If you plan to record new clips and use footage from your camera roll, start by adding the footage first. You can record directly in the editor, too. Step 3: Edit with the timeline Nifty new features aside, the basics are where things are vastly improved from Instagram\u2019s built-in editing tools \u2014 no more fiddly dragging and fumbling fingers. The frame-accurate timeline lets you trim, split, rearrange, and sync your clips with precision. To zoom in on the timeline and get ultra-precise, pinch your fingers together. Pull them apart to zoom out. To reorder your clips , tap and hold on the one you want to move. Keep holding while you drop it into position. Here\u2019s a quick overview of all the changes you can make to your clips in the timeline (tap on the clip you want to edit to highlight it, and these options will appear): Split: Cut your clip at a specific point in the timeline Volume: Adjust or mute the sound Adjust: Play around with brightness, contrast, warmth, etc. Speed: Slow the clip down or speed it up (up to 10x speed). Delete: Remove the clip from the timeline (don't worry, there\u2019s a handy \u2018undo\u2019 arrow above the timeline). Filters: Choose from a range of filters (including a few IG OG\u2019s like \u2018Paris\u2019 and \u2018Jakarta\u2019). Green screen: This opens your camera roll and removes your background, so you can record yourself over the footage already in your timeline. (More on this below.) Effects: Apply a handful of interesting effects, from zooms to strobe lights. Voice FX: Apply an effect to spoken audio from squeaky \u2018Helium\u2019 to creepy \u2018Alien.\u2019 Extract audio: Detach the audio from a clip. Mirror: Flip the footage vertically. Replace: Swap the clip out with another one (maintaining the length). Slip: A handy way to select another moment from a clip. Duplicate: Add an exact copy of a clip to the timeline. \u26a1\ufe0f Pro tip: Don\u2019t miss checking out the filters. There are some really lovely, subtle ones that enhance your footage rather than make it look weird. Step 4: Add effects, text, and audio Beyond the fundamental edits, there are some really fun features in Edits that will help elevate your video. To access these options, make sure that no footage is selected on your timeline: Audio: Add sounds from within the Instagram app (any audio you\u2019ve saved on Instagram will appear here, too). Text: Add text to your video. More on this below. Voice: Record a voiceover. Captions: Automatically detect captions. Overlay: Add an image or clip over the footage already in your timeline. Sound FX : Add fun sound effects. More on this below. Cutout: Add a portion of an image or clip as an overlay. More on this below, too. Sticker: It wouldn\u2019t be Instagram without stickers, would it? Add some beloved and new sticker designs and GIFs. Step 5: Export + post anywhere Once you\u2019re happy with the result, export in high-quality, watermark-free format (up to 4K!) \u2014 perfect for posting to Instagram, or any other short-form video platforms. The video will save to your camera roll, and you\u2019ll also be prompted to post directly on Instagram or Facebook. 7 Instagram Edits tips and tricks to help you level up your next video Edits is not Instagram \u2014 there\u2019s so much more you can do here than you would be able to in the social media platform\u2019s own, basic editing tools. Here are some ways you can get the most out of the new app: 1. Save ideas and inspiration If you\u2019re anything like me, you get your best ideas while anywhere but your desk \u2014 so having a place to store them all on the go is really handy. With Edits, you can save ideas as cute sticky notes inside the app by tapping the sticky note icon on the bottom left. To create a new note, tap the \u2018 + \u2019 icon on the bottom right. Here, you\u2019ll also find all your saved reels from Instagram by tapping the \u2018 Saved \u2019 button at the top, as well as your Instagram collections. \u26a1\ufe0f Pro tip: Get into the habit of saving any reels that feature audio you\u2019d like to use on Instagram. They\u2019ll appear right in your Edits app, complete with a \u2018 Use audio \u2019 button that automatically creates a new project with that audio already on the timeline. 2. Experiment with new fonts If you\u2019re a little tired of Instagram\u2019s native fonts, you\u2019ll be delighted to hear that Modern, Classic, Typewriter, and co. are far from the only options. There are around 50 new fonts to experiment with in the app, all helpfully organized into categories like \u2018Simple,\u2019 \u2018Bold,\u2019 and \u2018Handwritten.\u2019 Each font can be customized, too, with scores of fun animations, styles (also animated), and background options to play with. Discovering aesthetic combinations is one of my favorite new Edits features. There are enough fonts for you to really experiment, but not so many that it becomes overwhelming (I\u2019m talking to you, CapCut). 3. Use the green screen for low-edit wins Adding a talking head overlay is one of the best ways to explain something on video \u2014 but the editing can be really, really fiddly. The only tool to have really made this simple is TikTok, but as seasoned creators will know, it\u2019s best not to upload videos made in TikTok to Instagram (unless you\u2019re comfortable removing the watermark ). Enter Edits: The app has made recording off-the-cuff green screen videos really smooth. To do so, add your background footage or image to a new project first, then tap the green screen button underneath the timeline (pictured above). You can play around with the placement and size of your green screen overlay by pinching your fingers and dragging it around. As you record, the background video will play, so you can actually see what you\u2019re talking about as you film. The only drawback to this approach is that there is no way to edit the green screen recording once you\u2019re done, but I found I rather liked the simplicity of this. Cutting and moving green screen footage around can often make more of a mess than whatever you\u2019re trying to clean up. Of course, there is a way to record an editable green screen \u2014 though you won\u2019t see your background footage as you film. You\u2019ll just need to use your regular phone camera to film the green screen clip, then use the cutout feature, below. 4. Get creative with cutouts This might just be my favorite Edit\u2019s feature \u2014 it just has so much potential for some really creative, well, edits. Cutout lets you add a portion of another clip or image over another. You can manually choose what part of the media you want, or Edits chooses it automatically. Here\u2019s how it auto-selected this cutout: I was able to layer several of the same clip on top of each other with this feature, having my daughter appear three times in the same scene. All that said, my hope was that this feature would allow me to layer cutouts over text (a bit like I\u2019ve done in this video , which took ages of fiddly work on CapCut desktop). But, a bit frustratingly, you can\u2019t add a cutout over text in Edits right now. It will always appear on top of all the elements in your timeline. Here\u2019s hoping the Instagram team adds this soon! \ud83e\udd1e 5. Don\u2019t be shy with sound effects One of my favorite hacks for elevating a video from good to scroll-stopping is to add sound effects. But many video editors don\u2019t have these built in, and those that do (CapCut again) always seem to be oddly named, so it\u2019s difficult to find what you\u2019re after. Not only does Edits have its own sound effects you can add right in the app \u2014 there are around 50 here too \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re also organized into neat categories and feature their own icons. Easy to find exactly what you need at a glance. To use sound effects to their best advantage, I like to add things like bubble pops or clicks when text appears on screen, or even subtle swooshes for rapid transitions. 6. Scroll through trends to get inspired Finding fun formats and trending audio on Instagram can be a little tricky \u2014 you have to rely on the algorithm , hoping to stumble on something that will work for you. But Edits pulls them right into their native video tab. It\u2019s your reels feed, but only with trending videos. Tap on the video icon at the bottom left of the app to navigate there, and get scrolling. When you find an audio you like, you can even tap the ",

      "content_text": "The use of AI to generate weird and wonderful imagery is definitely one of my favorite applications of the cutting-edge tech. I've tested out AI writing tools and AI productivity tools , but putting the host of AI image generator through their paces was hands-down the most fun I've had in testing tools in ages (and I love testing tools). As with other AI tools, there's no shortage of artificial intelligence image generators on the market. I'm sure by the time this article is published, about 35 more will have just launched. \u2757 Looking for Pablo? We've sunsetted Pablo, Remix, and Stories Creator ( more on that here ), but the AI tools on this list might help! By now, we all know that AI image generation tools can come up with all sorts of fantastical, eclectic imagery. But since you're reading the Buffer blog, I'm going to be presumptuous and assume you're either in marketing, a small business owner, or a creator \u2014 and you're probably looking for a generative AI tool that can do something you can actually use in your work. Which is a lot like mine. I write content about creators and influencers for this blog and spend a good chunk of my day hunting through free stock photo sites for photos to use as featured images for these articles. So, I compared every generative AI tool with the same text prompt for an image I often need to find: \u201cGenerate an image of a photo-realistic young, Gen-Z social media influencer filming a video with their phone in selfie mode.\u201d In fairness, this is a tough prompt \u2014 AI image generation notoriously struggles with human fingers, teeth, and screens. But there's a reason the platforms on this list are the most popular and talked-about AI image generators of 2025. Of all the ones I tested, these consistently generated the highest-quality images. (I've included only the best in this article.) Here are my favorite AI image generators and how they stack up with one prompt in particular. \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f FYI: The waters are murky when it comes to using AI-generated images for commercial purposes. Read on for guidelines about using AI art for social media and marketing. Jump to a section: Best AI image generators: Quick summary Adobe Firefly Midjourney ChatGPT Canva Stable Assistant Gemini Recraft Reve Image Meta AI AI-generated images and copyright Best AI image generators: Quick summary Adobe Firefly : Best copyright-safe AI image generator Midjourney : Best AI image generator for artistic images ChatGPT : Best AI Image generator for refining results with prompts Canva : Best AI image generator for jazzing up other graphics Stable Assistant : Best AI Image generator for tweaking images Gemini : Best AI Image generator for tweaking images Recraft : Best free AI image generator Reve Image : Best AI image generator for sticking to prompts Meta AI : Best AI image generator for complete beginners Adobe Firefly Best copyright-safe AI image generator Generated by Adobe Firefly Adobe's answer to generative AI, Adobe Firefly , is baked into its suite of tools, including Photoshop, but there is a free web version available. What's great about Firefly (aside from the quality of the tool) is that the images generated with it are safe for commercial use. \u201cTrained on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content, Firefly is designed to be safe for commercial use,\u201d Adobe says. The free web version of the image generator, found at firefly.adobe.com , is remarkably easy to use. When you enter your prompt, you can choose aspect ratio, content type (art or photo), and one of hundreds of trending art style reference images (watercolor, studio photography, you name it). You can even specify the angle of the image and depth of field (close-ups, wide angles, macro photography, etc.), color and tone (pastel, monochrome, muted, and more), and some really fun special effects. After that, click \u2018Generate,' and the generative AI will deliver four new images for you to choose from. Clicking a drop-down arrow on each AI-generated image will allow you to generate something similar, use it as an image style reference for a new prompt, or edit it in Adobe Express (Adobe's answer to Canva). Firefly consistently created high-quality images, with very few Edward Scissorhands fingers. I found that playing around with the various art styles and effects pre-generated really helped me fine-tune my ask. Another strong point in Firefly's favor was the realism in the human faces in my AI photo \u2014 there was none of that creepy Uncanny Valley effect I got with many of the other tools. Adobe Firefly pricing: Free for the web version (25 generative credits monthly, images with watermarks). Plans start at $9.99 monthly. Midjourney Best AI image generator for artistic images Midjourney has long been one of my favorite text-to-image generators \u2014 you\u2019ll even see some featured images on this blog created with the tool. Midjourney was originally housed in Discord (which took some getting used to), but the generative AI tool has moved over to a smooth new website. While I sometimes miss the chaos of the Discord server, where you could watch other users create images in real time in a group chat-like interface, the simplicity of the clean new website makes generating images tough to beat. You\u2019ll input the prompts via the \u2018Create\u2019 tab, which features slider settings to specify AI image size and even \u2018stylization\u2019 and \u2018weirdness.\u2019 The image generator will churn out four options based on your prompt. You can choose to run it again, download one you like, or if you\u2019ve generated AI images that you like but want to tweak, there are a host of editing options to experiment with. My results with Midjourney are consistently high quality, and the AI rarely has a problem generating images that really do look like photos. What makes Midjourney stand out is the artistic quality of its outputs. It really creates digital art, excelling at rich scenes and stylized portraits that feel more like digital concept art than AI renders. In all my various regenerations of my \u2018influencer' prompt, there were no glitched fingers, and the people in the AI-generated artworks didn't have the creepy mannequin vibe that is often a result of asking AI to create images that look photorealistic. Midjourney pricing: Plans start at $8 per month (paid annually). ChatGPT Best AI Image generator for refining results with prompts Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT has scrapped its old DALL-E AI image generator in favor of having it baked right into the main product. The model has come a long way since DALL-E, which tended to favor Uncanny Valley mannequins when creating humans. When it comes to realism \u2014 and humans that don\u2019t look like reality TV stars \u2014 ChatGPT is really tough to beat. To use it, just describe what you want in plain language, just as you would a regular AI prompt \u2014 though you\u2019ll need to specify that it\u2019s an AI image and not text you\u2019re after. Unlike some of the other tools on this list, ChatGPT will only generate one image from your prompt \u2014 but you can continue to prompt it to make tweaks to the results, like \u201cmake it more photorealistic\u201d or \u201cadd a sunset in the background,\u201d and it will re-render accordingly. Another fun feature is that you can also upload your own image and ask ChatGPT's image generator to edit it with specific changes. Think: remove the background, change colors, or (as you\u2019ve no doubt seen on your social media feeds) transform it into a specific image style, like Studio Ghibli. While it\u2019s one of the more expensive tools on this list, ChatGPT is the most versatile \u2014 the generative AI can do so much more than just create high-quality images. If you\u2019re looking for an AI Swiss army knife, ChatGPT is it. ChatGPT pricing: Plans start at $20 per month. Canva Best AI image generator for jazzing up other graphics Many of Canva's best features are hidden behind its paid plans \u2014 but not its free online AI image generator. You can access the tool via canva.com/ai-image-generator (you'll be required to create or sign into an account before you get access, though). In the Canva editor, just search for the \u201cText to Image\u201d app and enter your prompt. You\u2019ll get a few results to start with, and from there, you can regenerate, resize, or drop the image directly into your design. Canva also offers basic image style options \u2014 like \u201cphoto,\u201d \u201cdrawing,\u201d or \u201cpainting\u201d \u2014 and you can now use AI to expand images, remove backgrounds, and more. Seconds after you hit \u2018enter,' Canva will generate AI images to choose from, which can then be pulled into your design. I was really impressed with how much the images generated for my influencer prompt looked like photographs \u2014 until I looked more closely at the fingers. That said, most of the images I generated were usable. Can you generate images that are as high-quality as Midjourney or Firefly? Not quite. But for content creators and marketers, the convenience factor is hard to overstate. Having this powerful AI image generator baked into Canva is a huge point in its favor, as many social media creators and marketers will likely already be using the image and video editing tool in some capacity. The power of Canva's vast library of templates, coupled with AI, makes this image generator a force to be reckoned with. Whether you\u2019re creating a presentation or an Instagram carousel, having the ability to generate AI images is a really handy addition. While Canva's AI image generator tool is available on its free plan, users are limited to 50 AI credits. Each change of image style or regeneration costs one credit. Canva AI Image Generator pricing: 50 credits available on Canva's free plan. Stable Assistant Best AI Image generator for tweaking images Stable Diffusion is an open-source AI image generator that anyone with technical know-how can download and build on \u2014 but don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to know how to do all that to use it. In 2025, they\u2019ve made the image creator model even more accessible through Stable Assistant , a chat-style inte",

Since you\u2019re starting from scratch, you have to begin to understand your audience, learn the algorithm and, perhaps most importantly, build up some consistency. Here\u2019s the ultimate guide on how you can gain your first 1,000 followers on the most popular social media platforms. Jump to a section Before you post: 5 prerequisites for any social platform As I share advice for each individual platform to gain more followers, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve already checked off these five things: 1. You have a great social media bio Your profile is all set up with an excellent picture of you or your business\u2019 logo and clearly explains what you do and how you can help your audience. This is a universal requirement across all social media platforms. Why is a social media bio so crucial? Imagine someone watched your social media posts and liked your content. Their next step will likely be checking out your social media profile. It should leave no questions unanswered about what you do and what kind of content you produce. 2. You have a niche If you\u2019re still finding your content pillars or social media niche , it\u2019s not worthwhile to focus on how to get followers. The tips here are only valid when you\u2019ve chosen a topic and have decided to stick to it. 3. You can stick to a consistent posting schedule All social media networks require consistent posting. You need a system already in place to post consistently \u2014 especially when you want to attract new followers. 4. You aren\u2019t resorting to buying followers All social media sites penalize buying fake followers. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s bots or real people paid to follow you, buying fake followers is the worst way to gain new followers. With these prerequisites sorted, here are personalized tips for each platform. How to get your first 1,000 followers on Facebook How often should you post : 1\u20132 posts per day What type of posts get the most engagement : Video Facebook Pages are making a comeback. Many people still use the platform to follow brands, engage with their content, and discover new products. The easiest way to increase your followers on Facebook is to lead with a community-driven approach. The Facebook algorithm loves authentic content that drives engagement. Think user generated content (UGC) , memes, and polls. Skincare company Hibiscus Monkey is a good example of an A+ Facebook marketing . They often create content around social proof , details about their product formulation, and time-sensitive content that\u2019d spark a conversation. In essence, Facebook wants you to start meaningful conversations. Think: What would entice engagement from my audience and get them talking? This will attract followers like moths to a flame. \ud83d\udca1 Learn more: How to Get More Followers on Facebook: 13 Tried-and-true Tactics How to get your first 1,000 followers on Instagram How often should you post : 2 Instagram Stories per day and 1\u20132 in-feed posts/day What type of posts get the most engagement : Instagram Reels Your Instagram marketing strategy should focus on hitting all content types. Out of all social media networks, Instagram probably has the most kinds of content: There\u2019s Instagram Stories, Instagram Carousels, Instagram Notes, Instagram Reels, Instagram ads, and Instagram Live. (Still, Instagram Reels rule engagement.) In terms of content, Instagram thrives on original and shareable content. To get more Instagram followers and appear on the Explore page, you need to create content that your potential followers would share with their friends in direct messages (DMs) . This can mean trending content that\u2019s related to time-sensitive news or memes and educational content like how-to videos. Instagram Stories are also an excellent way to promote your existing content, engage your existing followers, and use Instagram\u2019s many features like answering questions, running polls, timers, etc. An example: I love Mokobara\u2019s Instagram feed. Their Instagram content includes collaborating with niche influencers on their Instagram account. This puts a face to their brand, helps them lean into trends, and stay original.

People go to it to search for specific queries. To nail TikTok SEO , it\u2019s beneficial to have a hyper-specific niche \u2014 you can create content series around it and become a thought leader on the topic. If your niche is more casual, you can create entertaining content that uses trending sounds and participate in popular theme formats to gain new followers. TikTok content\u2019s shelf life is short, so you need to post more and post what\u2019s trending. A TikTok account I keep coming back to is tl;dv . They create top-notch roleplay videos that speak to their target audience. It\u2019s entertaining and relatable for the viewers watching. What I also love is their content strategy isn\u2019t marketing to relevant users directly. Few videos mention their products. They focus on becoming a funny account their community talks about first. @tldv.io I imagine a pack of QAs would be ferral #qa #developer #techstartup #productmanagement \u266c original sound - tldv.io - AI Meeting Recorder \ud83d\udca1 Continue learning : How to Get More Followers on TikTok in 2024 How to get your first 1,000 followers on X How often should you post : 3\u20134 posts/day What type of posts get the most engagement : Video X (formerly Twitter) is doubling down on vertical video content . If you\u2019re starting to grow your X following from scratch, the recommendation is you stick to a niche and create a mix of video-based and text-based posts. The X algorithm clearly shares that the premium users get extra reach. It might be worth buying if you\u2019re looking to grow your following on the platform quickly. In terms of content topics, X users love seeing informative content , followed by relevant, funny, trending, and engaging posts. An inspirational example: Freelancer Kat Boogard . She posts a host of things related to freelancing \u2014 things that are educational and informative, but also funny & relatable. She\u2019s the perfect example of keeping your X strategy useful and light-hearted at the same time. You can have a successful freelance career without: \u2022 Launching a course \u2022 Starting a podcast \u2022 Sending a newsletter \u2022 Posting to social media regularly Friendly reminder that there are plenty of freelancers doin' the dang thing quietly\u2014you just don't hear about it. \ud83d\ude0a \u2014 Kat Boogaard (@kat_boogaard) August 6, 2024 \ud83d\udca1 Learn more : 9 Ways to Grow Your Following on X/Twitter How to get your first 1,000 followers on LinkedIn How often should you post : 1 post/day What type of posts get the most engagement : Video LinkedIn is the place to build a personal brand in a professional setting. Think of it as a place to grow your network and get known for one core thing. And part of building a network is engaging with other people. LinkedIn values commenting, engaging, and responding to other people\u2019s posts more than any other platform. The good thing about LinkedIn is there\u2019s not a ton of difference in the engagement you get using various post types. So if text-based or carousels are more of your jam than video, post them instead of focusing on videos. A top-notch LinkedIn page is Pretty Little Marketer . They often post about trending marketing memes, valuable hard-earned knowledge, and other news people might\u2019ve missed. Bottom line : Focus on creating LinkedIn content that educates your target audience. It can be something you\u2019re working on, a struggle you\u2019ve recently resolved in your workplace, etc. And don\u2019t forget to interact with others in your niche. \ud83d\udca1 Dive deeper : How to Get More Followers on LinkedIn How to get your first 1,000 followers on Pinterest How often should you post : 15\u201325 pins/day What type of posts get the most engagement : Video and images Pinterest thrives on quantity. To get your first 1,000 followers, you need to put out fresh pins consistently in large numbers. This doesn\u2019t need to be all fresh info \u2014 it can be recycled to be the same info, different graphics. Pinterest is also the ultimate social media platform for inspirational content. So your strategy should focus on creating content your audience can aspire to. Share ideas that encourage your audience to try something new. Pinterest is also partly a search engine, so I\u2019d recommend focusing on using keywords and basic SEO techniques to get some followers quickly. Beauty creator Melisza Mcfierce is an inspirational Pinterest creator.

      "content_text": "Instagram is quietly testing a new feature that could change how creators and brands share content \u2014 and I\u2019m pretty excited about the potential. In their words: Unlockable reels are designed to encourage \u201ca new, IYKYK way\u201d of engaging with your community. The new Instagram Reels , also called \u201clocked\u201d or \u201csecret code\u201d reels, will require a (you guessed it) secret code to view. These password-protected videos offer a fresh way to build excitement, reward your most engaged Instagram followers , and share content with a more targeted audience. Also, they\u2019ll be a delight to puzzle fanatics like me. After some initial testing, The Weeknd was the first creator to officially use an unlockable reel, teasing a clip from his new film. (Did anyone else not know he was doing movies now?) Let\u2019s break down how it works, why it matters, and how you might use it when (or if) it rolls out more broadly. What are unlockable reels? Unlockable reels are videos that are hidden behind a code. Instead of tapping play, you\u2019ll be prompted to \u201cEnter secret code\u201d before you can view the content. In some cases, creators will offer a clue instead of just giving you the code outright \u2014 for example, \u201cmy birthday\u201d or \u201c1st hashtag in the caption.\u201d Once you crack the code, the reel plays like any other. In April, an unlockable reel was quietly shared from the Instagram @design account, prompting followers to enter a code to access the video. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instagram\u2019s @design (@design) Before entering the code, the thumbnail appears blurred out. Here\u2019s how the post looks in the feed and when you tap on it: Not long after, @theweeknd shared an unlockable reel, now deleted, teasing a clip from his new movie, Hurry Up Tomorrow behind a code: \u2018ICANTSING*\u2019*. As far as we know, these are the only two password-protected reels shared on the platform yet, but I predict we\u2019ll soon see the feature rolled out to more big-name creators. Source: Social Media Today Why would you want to share an unlockable reel? Good question! On a platform where views and impressions are often treated as the be-all and end-all, why would you want to share a \u2018secret\u2019 reel? Well, we know that Instagram has been more focused on its community-building features of late (think subscriptions, broadcast channels, or even Threads). Password-protected reels offer a way for creators and brands to offer something special to superfans (of followers who love a good puzzle). It\u2019s unclear if these reels will be eligible to appear in the main reels or explore page. My prediction is they\u2019ll be targeted mainly at current followers (and be more likely to appear in users\u2019 home feeds). The Instagram algorithm will likely count clicks and attempts to unlock the reel as engagement signals. According to Instagram, this is a new way to \u201chelp people connect in a new, IYKYK [if you know, you know], way.\u201d The feature is intended to: Build buzz around exclusive content Foster connection over shared interests Reward superfans with hidden gems \u26a1 Be more consistent on Instagram: Having an all-in-one tool like Buffer helps you plan, post, engage, and track. Get started for free today and see for yourself . How creators and brands might use unlockable reels If you\u2019re a creator, marketer, or small business owner, there\u2019s a lot of potential here for fun posts and campaigns with this new feature. As a creator and marketer, I\u2019m definitely looking forward to playing around with them! Think: Exclusive drops for your mailing list: Share a secret code with newsletter subscribers to unlock behind-the-scenes content, bonus tutorials, or sneak peeks \u2014 a creative way to reward your most engaged audience (and grow your subscribers). Early access content for loyal fans: Let superfans or private community members get first dibs on a new product, video, or announcement by giving them the code before anyone else. Promo codes for repeat customers: Share limited-time offers through a locked reel that only your existing customers can access \u2014 either by emailing them the code or including it in a thank-you note. Launch hints or teaser trailers for product reveals: Build anticipation by hiding teaser content behind a code that followers have to figure out \u2014 perfect for gamifying a product drop or campaign launch. Region-locked content for specific markets: Share updates or offers tailored to a local audience by distributing codes through regional mailing lists or in-store signage. Private posts just for friends: Share a code with just a few close friends or collaborators to keep it personal. It\u2019s a fun, lightweight form of content gating, without the need for paywalls or subscriptions. Watch this space Unlockable reels aren\u2019t available to most users just yet. It\u2019s not clear when \u2014 or if \u2014 this feature will be rolled out more widely, but it\u2019s one of my top social media platform features to watch at the moment. I\u2019ll be sure to update this article when I know more. To an unlockable reel in action, check out @design , which used a caption clue to unlock their reel (\u201c1st # in the caption,\u201d which is threads ).

How to make GIFs in Photoshop from images Creating GIFs in Adobe Photoshop takes a little more time than any of the other apps and products we\u2019ve mentioned so far, but it also gives you the most freedom to create exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Here\u2019s an example of a GIF we made in Photoshop using the technique we\u2019ll explain below:\u200c Here's a GIF showcasing Buffer's Start Page \u200c\u200c Step 1. Load images into Photoshop If you already have a sequence of images ready \u200cGIFs are made up of a series of images (called frames), and if you already have a bunch of images you\u2019d like to turn into a GIF, open Photoshop, the select File > Scripts > Load Files Into Stack .\u200c Then select \u2018Browse\u2019 and choose the files you\u2019d like to include in your GIF.\u200c If you don\u2019t have an image set ready \u200c If you don\u2019t have an existing group of images you\u2019d like to use, you can create a set of new layers within Photoshop to act as the frames in your GIF. To add new layers to your Photoshop project, choose Layer > New > Layer until all your frames are included. When all your layers are ready, go to Step 2 and create your animation. Step 2: Create your animation To animate a GIF animation, you need to organize your images into a timeline. This will set up the flow of the animation and make your image ready to export as a GIF. To create your Timeline, click Window > Timeline . You\u2019ll then see a Timeline appear at the bottom right of your screen.\u200c Next, click \u2018Create Frame Animation\u2019 within your Timeline, and then click the menu in the right-hand corner of your Timeline and choose \u2018Make Frames From Layers.\u2019\u200c Now that your frames are in place, it\u2019s a good idea to preview your animation. Hit the Play button in the bottom left of your Timeline, and check for any frames that are out of place. If they are, simply drag and drop them to a new position in the Timeline.\u200c Step 3: Export your GIF Once you\u2019re happy with the way your GIF looks, export it for use on your website, social media profiles, or anywhere you\u2019d like to share it. To export your GIF, click File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy). \u200c \u200c\u200c \u200cYou\u2019ll now see the \u2018Save for Web\u2019 window, and this is where you can choose the type of GIF you\u2019d like to create. Under the \u201cPreset\u201d menu, select GIF 128 Dithered . The number after the GIF indicates the number of colors that\u2019ll be included in your GIF, and including Dither helps to alleviate pixelation from color banding . Then, change the Colors setting to 256 (the maximum number for a GIF).\u200c \u200c\u200c To see how it turned out, hit Preview\u2026 in the bottom left corner. It\u2019ll open your default web browser and play a looping preview of your GIF.\u200c \u200c\u200cFinally, click Save as, name your GIF file, and download your masterpiece to your computer. How to convert a video into a GIF using Photoshop Photoshop can also help you convert a video into a GIF by transforming each frame of the video into a frame within a GIF. To import a video, click File > Import > Video Frames to Layers .\u200c You\u2019ll then have the option to choose how much of the video you import and whether you\u2019d like to pull in every frame (for longer GIFs, importing every other frame should be sufficient quality).\u200c Once you\u2019ve imported your video, you can add text and captions and make edits within Photoshop, and then follow Step 3 from the previous section to export your GIF.

      "content_text": "Pinterest is one of my most used social media sites . While I love the buzz of TikTok, the inspiration I find on Instagram, and the opportunities for learning on LinkedIn, I often need to take breaks from the major platforms. But never Pinterest. No matter where I\u2019m at in my life, there\u2019s always something I need from the visual search engine. I\u2019ll often hop onto the app or website with a specific query in mind \u2014 \u201cliving room decor,\u201d \u201ccapsule wardrobe,\u201d and \u201cproductivity tools\u201d are some of my most recent searches. As you\u2019ll have guessed from those examples, I usually open up the Pinterest app with one of three goals: Find inspiration Figure out how to do something Buy something And I\u2019m not unique in this, either \u2014 according to data from Pinterest , more than 85 percent of users have made a purchase based on pins from brands. Pinterest boasts 498 million global active users, making it one of the most popular social networking platforms in the world. But it\u2019s how those Pinterest lovers use the app that\u2019s worth paying attention to. According to a 2024 report by DataReportal,\u00a036.6 percent of active users are on the app to follow or research brands and products, making it the main reason they use Pinterest. To put that into perspective, Pinterest beats YouTube, X (Twitter), and even LinkedIn for brand and product research. So, if you\u2019re a business or a creator looking to monetize, using Pinterest as part of your marketing efforts is well worth exploring. Convinced yet? The good news is that learning to use Pinterest is simple, even if you\u2019re new to the platform. This beginner\u2019s guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to use Pinterest, step-by-step, from creating a business or personal profile, scheduling your pins, measuring your success, and more. \u26a1 Now you can schedule your pins with Buffer whether you have a business or personal account! Find out how to use Buffer with Pinterest \u2192 What is Pinterest? Pinterest is \u201ca visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more,\u201d as the platform describes itself. In practice, the social media platform looks a lot like a virtual pinboard where users can discover and save ideas represented by visual cards or \u2018pins\u2019 to their own \u2018boards.\u2019 Brands, creators, and private users can create pins by uploading an image or video from their devices. Each pin can have its own title and description and a website link (important for brands and creators looking to drive traffic elsewhere). Users can also save pins of images they find online with Pinterest\u2019s browser extension. All Pinterest users, whether they have a business or personal account, have a profile where others can see their Pinterest boards and pins (unless they choose to make a board private). Beyond the mechanics, I love this definition Pinterest marketing expert and agency owner Heather Farris shared with Buffer: \u201cIf Google Images and Instagram were to have a baby, you\u2019d land on Pinterest.\u201d The benefits of Pinterest for businesses and creators Like other social media platforms, Pinterest can be a powerful marketing tool for reaching new followers. It can help: Increase brand awareness Drive website traffic Increase sales and conversions Heather says Pinterest is like a search engine that drives new customers to businesses and creators. \u201cIt has allowed them to thrive,\u201d she says. \u201cPinterest users are different from others because they have a higher intent to purchase and often spend more money per purchase.\u201d \u201cPinners are also planners, so they are very meticulous about how they use this platform, carefully organizing their Pinterest pins into curated boards they can refer back to later,\u201d she adds. Another point in Pinterest\u2019s favor: because of how the algorithm (content ranking) on Pinterest works, users don\u2019t have to follow you to discover your content, nor do your pins have to be very new for them to be recommended. \u201cThey can simply search for something, and if you\u2019ve done your research and optimizations correctly, you have the chance to show up right when they search for you,\u201d Heather says. Unlike other social media sites, older content, if well-optimized, isn\u2019t immediately excluded \u2014 that\u2019s not how Pinterest works! This means your pins could continue gaining traction months or even years after you first publish them. \u201cPinterest will send you traffic for the long run,\u201d Heather says. \u201cI have personally made pins for my brands that, five, six, or seven years later, are still bringing people to my website.\u201d Who is Pinterest best for? While any business or creator can succeed on the platform, some industries and niches tend to perform best, whether you\u2019re a creator, blogger, or brand. Heather says that Pinterest is a must if you work in one of the niches below. \u201cI have worked with brands across all these categories, and they have all seen success in some form or another.\u201d Home decor/interior design Beauty Wellness Fashion Children\u2019s activities Parenting Design DIY and crafts Food Gardening Health Mindset Wedding Travel Education Which Pinterest account is right for me? Pinterest offers both personal and business (professional) accounts. There are some key differences between the two. \u201cPersonal and business accounts on Pinterest are similar, but business accounts include features that are helpful to business owners and marketers,\u201d the platform says. Business accounts will have access to: Pinterest Analytics, where you can review analytics for your Pins . Advertising features including idea ads , video ads , carousels , collections ads , product catalogs , and more. The Pinterest Business Hub or Creator Hub (a place to find all the tools, tips, and insights you need to learn more about your audience, performance, and upcoming trends). A personal Pinterest account is great if you\u2019re just using it to save ideas for later. If you\u2019re using Pinterest as a creator, business, or marketer, a Pinterest business account is your best bet. Good news if you\u2019re just exploring the platform or already have a personal account: you can switch to a business account or connect a business account to your existing personal profile .

      "content_text": "I try to post consistently on LinkedIn, but I confess that it\u2019s not always top of my list when deadlines are looming, my toddler\u2019s kept me up at night, and I simply can\u2019t justify yet another cup of coffee to keep me going. We all have those days, which is why it\u2019s so helpful to batch your LinkedIn content creation and schedule your LinkedIn posts ahead of time . According to Buffer\u2019s latest data , LinkedIn is now the strongest platform for organic engagement, with a median rate of 8%. This shows us that success on the platform isn\u2019t about going viral once, but about building steady, predictable engagement over time. So, if you have thought leadership to share (and I\u2019m willing to bet you do), staying consistent by scheduling your posts on LinkedIn is a massive opportunity to reach more people and build a credible reputation out in the professional world. In this guide, I\u2019ll walk you through two simple ways to schedule your LinkedIn posts on your company page and/or personal profile. Jump to a section: LinkedIn company page vs. personal LinkedIn profile How to schedule a post on LinkedIn How to schedule LinkedIn posts using Buffer as a scheduling tool Scheduling LinkedIn posts on Buffer vs. LinkedIn at a glance Here\u2019s why it\u2019s a smart move to learn how to schedule LinkedIn posts Quick tips for scheduling LinkedIn posts Get scheduling More LinkedIn resources FAQ on scheduling LinkedIn posts LinkedIn company page vs. personal LinkedIn profile What\u2019s the difference between a personal page and a company page on LinkedIn? Your personal profile is all about you: your skills, experience, and voice. It\u2019s where you connect, build relationships, and share thought leadership in a more personal, authentic way. A company page represents your business. It\u2019s where you showcase your brand, post updates, and build credibility at an organizational level. \ud83d\udcda Learn more about the world\u2019s largest professional network with this round-up of 26 LinkedIn stats to know in 2025 . Which type of LinkedIn profile should you use? If you run a business and have the time and capacity to dedicate to a company page and your personal profile, you would ideally do both. If not, I recommend starting with your personal profile \u2014 people connect with people first. Then, support your efforts with a company page to establish your brand and give your audience a place to learn more about your business. Of course, this depends on your content strategy and goals. In my case, as a sole proprietor, I am the business, so I only have a personal profile. How to schedule a post on LinkedIn You can schedule posts on LinkedIn using the built-in scheduling feature on both desktop and mobile devices. The steps to schedule a post natively on LinkedIn are the same for a personal profile and a company page. Start a post as you normally would from the LinkedIn homepage. Instead of hitting Post , click on the little clock icon. You\u2019ll be taken to a pop-up window where you can set the date and time you\u2019d like your post to go live. Hit Next , then the Schedule button. Simple, right? Just note that there are a few limitations to be aware of: If you\u2019re Type-A about planning your content in advance (and part superhero), you might be disappointed to learn that you can only use LinkedIn's built-in scheduling tool to publish posts up to three months in advance. If you want to post different types of content, you need to be aware that you can\u2019t natively schedule posts for LinkedIn groups, events, jobs, or services. Where do I see my scheduled LinkedIn posts? In my opinion, finding scheduled posts on LinkedIn isn\u2019t super intuitive, and I remember having to Google how to do it a while back. (Maybe you did, and that\u2019s how you landed here. Hi! \ud83d\udc4b) Here\u2019s how to go about it: Start a post. Click on the little clock icon to go to the scheduled posts section. Click on View all scheduled posts \u2192 to see what you\u2019ve got in the pipeline. \u26a1 Pro tip : This section is also where you can reschedule, delete, or edit scheduled posts. Click the three little dots on the top left to see the options. How to schedule LinkedIn posts using Buffer as a scheduling tool Buffer was built to make social media management a breeze, and it shows. Here\u2019s how to schedule LinkedIn posts in just a few clicks using Buffer as your social media management tool: Head to your Buffer Channels area to connect your LinkedIn Page or profile (or both). Once your LinkedIn channel is connected, you can go ahead and click the blue + New button on the top right of your Buffer dashboard. Create your post and select the channels you\u2019d like to publish to. Click the down arrow next to Add to Queue , and choose the Schedule Post option. You\u2019ll then be able to choose a scheduled date and time for your post to be published. It will publish automatically at the scheduled time. \u26a1 Pro tip : Use Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant if you need some help creating or polishing your post. Include key points, your target audience, and your desired outcome in your prompt. What kind of posts can I schedule on LinkedIn? Like native LinkedIn scheduling, you can schedule LinkedIn posts in these formats: text-only, image, GIF, PDF carousel, video, and link previews. How do I mention other LinkedIn Pages and profiles? To mention a LinkedIn Page, copy and paste the LinkedIn URL for that Page into the composer (e.g., to mention Buffer, you would copy and paste our LinkedIn URL that looks like this: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bufferapp/ . To mention a LinkedIn profile, you can type the @ symbol and search for a profile* to tag. You can learn more about LinkedIn tagging here.

Grow faster: Pages that post weekly see 5.6x more follower growth . For pages and individuals, showing up regularly signals relevance to both your audience and the LinkedIn algorithm. Save time and stress: Plan your LinkedIn posts ahead so you\u2019re not scrambling to come up with something last minute. Work smarter: Batch-create posts to keep showing up and maintaining a professional presence, without cutting into your personal time. Stay on-brand: Align your LinkedIn posts with your bigger goals so you have more control over how you show up online. And\u2026 scheduling on LinkedIn works I\u2019ve been taking part in Buffer\u2019s Creator Camp , which started on 16 June. I scheduled my posts in advance so that I could be more consistent, which resulted in 20% more impressions and 28% more engagements than the previous 28-day period. Quick tips for scheduling LinkedIn posts Stay fresh: try new formats LinkedIn isn\u2019t just for text-heavy posts and humblebrags anymore. Video posts are having a moment, and we need to embrace them (this is me giving myself a pep talk). If you\u2019re a bit hesitant like me, don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to stand in front of your camera and deliver a TED Talk. Try a simple voiceover, a quick behind-the-scenes clip, or a little day-in-the-life montage. Even a peek at your chaotic desk can be oddly interesting (and relatable). I loved this idea from my creative colleague, Kirsti Lang (bonus productivity hack too): Be relevant; be you People come to LinkedIn to learn something new or get inspired \u2014 and the algorithm knows it. LinkedIn posts that are helpful, insightful, or just genuinely useful tend to do better. Share what you know, keep it authentic, and you\u2019ll stay in good standing with both your audience and the feed gods. As an example, this post of mine did pretty well because I think it hit a nerve (and hopefully helped) my fellow freelancers: Find a system that works for you Consistency beats perfection",

      "content_text": "My resolution this year was to make more videos \u2014 or honestly, to make any video at all. So I wrote a script, hit record, and ended up with a bunch of footage I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with. I had questions. Lots of them. How do you add captions so everyone can follow along? What even is b-roll? And are video editors really as complicated as they look? Enter AI: It\u2019s already helping me work smarter in other areas. I decided to do what I do best \u2014 start experimenting. I set out to test a bunch of tools in search of the best AI video editors of 2025. Most AI video editors now come with a pretty standard toolkit: they\u2019ll clean up background noise, cut out filler words like \u201cum\u201d and \u201cuh,\u201d remove long silences, generate captions, and let you remove the background entirely if you want. They even act as AI video makers and can use text-to-video capabilities to create complete videos with just a prompt. Where things get interesting is when you look at which one of these AI video editors does these basic edits the best, what else these tools can do and, more importantly, which ones are worth using depending on the kind of video you\u2019re making. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the best AI video editors right now, based on what they do especially well. Best AI video editors: 1. Adobe Premiere Pro \u2014 Best for editors working on complex or long-form projects 2. Canva \u2014 Best for social media videos that blend simple editing with rich design options 3. CapCut \u2014 Best for flexible, fuss-free desktop and mobile editing 4. Clipchamp \u2014 Best for anyone getting started with video editing 5. DaVinci Resolve \u2014 Best for advanced projects that need full creative control 6. Descript \u2014 Best for podcasts, interviews, and other dialogue-heavy videos 7. Final Cut Pro \u2014 Best for high-end projects that need advanced visual effects 8. Kapwing \u2014 Best for editing at speed without sacrificing features 9. Opus Clip \u2014 Best for turning longer videos into short, shareable clips 10. Veed \u2014 Best all-in-one editor for long-form videos without a learning curve 11.Wondershare Filmora \u2014 Best for creators who want more control without the complexity Bonus - Adobe Podcast \u2014 Best for getting crystal-clear audio for your videos Does AI video generation play a role in the editing process? AI video editing fits around you 1. Adobe Premiere Pro Best for editors working on complex or long-form projects Source: Adobe Adobe Premiere Pro is filled with pro-level tools that hand you plenty of creative control but also a bit more to learn along the way. An AI-powered feature that stands out is Morph Cut, which really shines when you\u2019ve trimmed filler words or awkward pauses from an interview or talking head video. Instead of leaving behind a hard, obvious cut, Morph Cut blends the clips so they play like one continuous take, as if the camera never stopped rolling. And while almost every tool in this list can reframe horizontal videos into 9:16 for social, Premiere Pro goes a step further with its AI Reframe tool. It automatically finds the subject in your shot and tracks their movement so the final video stays focused on the action. If video editing is a regular part of your week (or you\u2019re working on something big), Premiere Pro is probably worth the time to learn and investment. For quick trims or casual clips, though, it might be more than you need. Price: On its own, it\u2019s $34.99 per month paid monthly ($37.99 per person for teams), also available as a bundle with the rest of Adobe\u2019s 20+ creative tools 2. Canva Best for social media videos that blend simple editing with rich design options Source: Canva What can\u2019t Canva do? Its massive library of elements and integrations makes it easy to create almost any kind of social video \u2014 whether that\u2019s a quick TikTok, an eye-catching Instagram Reel , or a polished promo. One standout feature is Magic Design \u2014 part AI video generator, part AI video editor. It quickly creates videos from up to 10 of your photos or video clips and a text-to-video prompt. You get a first draft complete with smart captions, transitions, animations, and even background music. Of course, you\u2019re not locked into Canva\u2019s music. If you\u2019d rather use trending audio or your own voiceover, you can download videos \u2014 with all the text, transitions, and animations \u2014 then add your audio in TikTok or Instagram. On the flip side, Canva is slightly limiting if your videos rely heavily on speech or dialogue. While it can generate automatic captions, it doesn\u2019t support script-based editing. Deleting a word from the transcript will only remove the caption, not the actual footage. If you\u2019re working with speech-heavy videos like interviews or talking-head videos, there are some great AI-powered video editors coming up that are built for exactly this. Price: Free plan with limited AI features, Pro plans start at $15 per month paid monthly ($10 per person for teams) \u26a1 Set your videos up for success \u2014 schedule them across TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram in just a few clicks with Buffer. Here\u2019s how \u2192 3. CapCut Best for flexible, fuss-free desktop and mobile editing Source: CapCut No roundup of AI video editing software would be complete without CapCut . TikTok\u2019s official video editor is lightweight, easy to use, and packs in a lot of power in both its desktop and mobile apps. Like most video editors, CapCut includes tools to clean up background noise and enhance your audio, and it goes a step further with Isolate Voice. You can use this AI feature to separate vocals from the music in a song, so you\u2019re left with either the vocals or just the instrumental \u2014 whatever best fits your project. It\u2019s smart to skip this feature for tracks from major labels, since copyright rules can be tricky. The good news: there are plenty of royalty-free or licensed music options out there that let you experiment without worry. Price: Free plan, with Pro plans starting at $5.99 per month paid monthly for mobile only, and $19.99 per month paid monthly for mobile, desktop, and web ($24.99 per person for teams) 4. Clipchamp Best for anyone getting started with video editing Source: Clipchamp If you\u2019re new to video editing, Microsoft\u2019s Clipchamp is one of the easiest ways to dive in. It comes with tons of ready-made templates and without a steep learning curve. Clipchamp\u2019s AI video tools are fairly simple: background noise suppression, removing silences, text-to-speech, auto transcription and captions, and background removal. Where it shines is with its generous free plan. Clipchamp is the only video editor in this list that lets you use all these AI features for free \u2014 and export your videos without a watermark. That\u2019s a rare find! For anyone just starting out, it offers a lot without asking for much in return. Paid plans add extras like premium stock assets, higher resolution exports for better video quality, and a brand kit to help you keep your videos on-brand as you grow. Price: Free plan with all AI features included, Premium plan starts at $11.99 per month paid monthly. It\u2019s also included in many Microsoft plans, including those for businesses. 5. DaVinci Resolve Best for advanced projects that need full creative control Source: DaVinci Resolve Like Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve is a longtime favorite among professional editors, especially for projects that need a polished, cinematic finish. Two of its most impressive AI tools are Music Remixer and Relight. Music Remixer lets you isolate the individual elements in a song \u2014 vocals, bass, guitar, drums. You can adjust the volume of each one separately, mute specific instruments, or solo a single track to create the exact mix you want. Want only the bassline? Done. Need everything but the drums? That works too. You can build a mix that fits your video perfectly. Relight is a powerful AI tool to adjust the lighting in your shot. If you\u2019ve ever finished shooting and wished the lighting were different, Relight lets you fix it after the fact. You can add a virtual light source to your footage to change the light\u2019s direction, adjust shadows, or completely shift the mood of a scene without having to reshoot. The free version of DaVinci Resolve includes plenty of pro-level features, so it\u2019s a solid place to start if you\u2019re still learning the ropes. When you\u2019re ready to take things further, you can upgrade to the Studio version to access tools like Music Remixer and Relight. No subscriptions here \u2014 the paid version is a one-time purchase. Price: Free version available with an extensive feature set, DaVinci Resolve Studio is a one-time payment of $295 6. Descript Best for podcasts, interviews, and other dialogue-heavy videos Source: Descript Descript is built for speech-first content like podcasts , interviews, webinars, and explainer videos \u2014 and it shows. While most AI video editors now offer script-based editing, Descript\u2019s entire workflow is built around the transcript. You can remove words or phrases from the transcript, and Descript will cut them out of the video itself. Plus, you can even add new scenes and mark chapters just as if you\u2019re marking up a document. These are its basic AI-powered tools. Then there are the advanced ones. If you\u2019ve recorded a take multiple times to get it right (who among us hasn\u2019t?), Remove Retakes is an incredible time saver. It scans your video, automatically identifies the best take, and cuts the rest. There\u2019s no damage done if you don\u2019t like its choice \u2014 you can easily pick another one instead, right from the transcript. And for anyone recording interviews or podcasts, Automatic Multicam takes footage from multiple cameras and automatically creates a professional, dynamic cut that switches between speakers at the right moments. Descript also has an AI agent co-editor called Underlord you can summon at any time to make specific changes, walk you through how to do something, or even just give you feedback on your video's script. It\u2019s still in beta, so results can be a little unpredictable, but it showed a lot of promis",

      "content_text": "After almost a decade of creating and a few years of working remotely, becoming a mom in mid-2024 made consistency and work-life balance my biggest challenges. Before I knew it, I was burnt out, questioning myself, and barely staying productive. TL;DR : I found myself spiralling, and it felt like the walls were closing in on me. If you\u2019re a creator, small business owner, or marketer juggling remote work and parenting, you know exactly what I mean. Thankfully, this season didn\u2019t last too long. After a few messy months, I found a simple system\u2014including some smart outsourcing\u2014that now helps me: Post 2-5 times a week across LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Grow my audience (from ~7k to ~10k) and boost engagement (from ~50 to ~80+ per post) Connect with prospective employers Still have time for client work, family, and rest So here\u2019s the tea. \u2615 1. Work with a hybrid content assistant I work with a content assistant who supports ideation, shooting, design, editing, and logistics. We meet in person 2\u20133 times per month to batch-create , and I pay her a retainer fee. She also attends events, like parties or outings, with me to help capture moments for vlog-style content . This arrangement works because it: Lightens my mental load Keeps me accountable (because I\u2019m paying for it!) Allows for flexible collaboration depending on my schedule and budget Boosts my remote work productivity To align expectations and stay agile, we communicate via phone calls, email, and WhatsApp conversations. \ud83d\udca1 You don\u2019t necessarily need a full-time hire. Start small\u2014even a few hours a month can make a difference. It was an easy hire for me because she\u2019s my cousin, who\u2019s also a social media manager with great content creation skills. But you can get yours through referrals or an open hiring call. Outsourcing goes beyond human capital, though. Automation is also where the magic is, which brings me to my next point. 2. Streamline key tasks with tools Creating consistently isn\u2019t about having the best content strategy or making out-of-budget hires. The right tools\u2014whether free or paid\u2014can keep your production fast, organized, and scalable, even on a tight schedule. For example, I used to send my newsletter, The Profitable Content Marketer , so haphazardly that its growth plateaued. Once I mastered ChatGPT prompts and began scheduling social media posts with Buffer, though, I spent less time writing and posting\u2014and more time growing my Substack. Here are the exact tools my assistant and I rely on the most: Tool Purpose Hack Canva Designing quick, clean graphics Save 3\u20135 templates for different content types and create a brand kit for consistent + memorable visuals CapCut Editing social videos (short-form and YouTube) Use the app\u2019s ready-to-use transitions and caption styles for easy, professional-looking videos Buffer Scheduling social content ahead of time Schedule posts as soon as they\u2019re ready to avoid a pile-up or missed days. Be open to manual posting or in-app scheduling if necessary Google Sheets Creating a content calendar and tracking what\u2019s been published Leave room for freestyle posting. Sometimes the best-performing posts are the spontaneous ones iOS Notes app Note-taking, drafting captions, and creating to-do lists on the go Let go of perfectionism and just braindump. You can refine later. ChatGPT Fine-tuning ideas, doing quick research, and turning rough thoughts into polished text Avoid copy-and-paste. Guide the AI with strategic prompts and watch it elevate your voice. Selar Selling digital and physical products like books and 1:1 sessions Build content and CTAs around your products to drive steady sales I don\u2019t use every tool daily, but I combine them based on my workflow each month. I might jot down ideas in Notes while cooking, then refine them in ChatGPT before a shoot. My assistant could then design and edit all the posts in Canva and CapCut, while either of us updates the calendar. Thankfully, most of these tools are either completely free or come with robust trial versions, letting you explore them with minimal financial investment. \ud83d\udca1 Start with free or trial versions, and only upgrade when you\u2019ve proven your workflow or monetized. And, if you\u2019re comfortable, give your assistant access to your tools and social accounts to keep things on track. Of course, tools only work if you can find the time to use them. Here\u2019s how I carve that out of my very packed schedule\u2026 3. Use late-night deep work sessions With a toddler and freelance work, my days pass by quickly. So sometimes, I take 2\u20134 focused hours after bedtime to: Generate content ideas Respond to emails Complete client deliverables Record content Track analytics and update my content calendar This isn\u2019t forever \u2014 it\u2019s just what works in my current season of life. For context, I wrote most of this article late at night while my baby slept. No jokes. \ud83d\ude02 Meanwhile, beyond not having time during the day, I\u2019ve also become quite nocturnal since the pandemic lockdown period. And I know I\u2019m not alone. \ud83d\udca1 If you have early mornings or childcare support, adjust your \u201cdeep work\u201d window to fit. Also, set a cut-off time (mine changes each night depending on when I start) and keep a warm drink or a light snack nearby, rather than endless caffeine. Prioritize one \u201cmust-finish\u201d task each night for a sense of accomplishment. But here\u2019s the thing: incessantly working at night is unsustainable. You could fall into an endless cycle of unproductive days and sleepless nights. And take it from someone who\u2019s been there, you really don\u2019t want that. That\u2019s why, besides the occasional nightcrawling, I also suggest you 4. Visit co-working spaces as needed When I have tight deadlines or need uninterrupted daytime focus, I book a co-working space. It: Helps me get more done faster Provides a mental shift from home life to work mode Prevents me from working all night and being tired all day Can be paid for daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on budget and specific needs My local space costs about $3/day and a focused session easily pays for itself in client work. Exhibit A: On this day, I had multiple deadlines to meet and knew that even with a babysitter, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish all the assignments if I worked from home. So, I went to a nearby work hub for a few hours and finished the rest at home, mostly during my late-night deep work sessions. \ud83d\udca1 Use co-working for \u201csprints\u201d. E.g., ideate and add 2 weeks of content to your calendar, apply to your weekly dose of job opportunities, or complete pending projects that have been dragging on. Even with all these tips, you can\u2019t truly optimize what you don\u2019t measure. Hence, why you must always 5. Track results I don\u2019t use any complicated tools for monitoring social media engagement\u2014just the built-in analytics in each platform (e.g., LinkedIn) and Buffer\u2019s weekly email reports. Every month, I: Review follower growth and engagement (likes, comments, shares) Identify which posts performed best Look for patterns (format, topic, time of posting) and adjust future content ideas accordingly One way this has played out is that we noticed LinkedIn had a shortage of video content creators, but people actually appreciate them more than you might think. We began posting more LinkedIn videos and significantly increased engagement.
