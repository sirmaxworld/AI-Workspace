Transcript Eric Bradlow: Welcome, everyone, to the first episode of the Analytics at Wharton and AI at Wharton podcast series on artificial intelligence. My name\u2019s Eric Bradlow. I\u2019m a professor of marketing and statistics here at the Wharton School. I\u2019m also vice dean of Analytics at Wharton, and I will be the host for this multi-part series on artificial intelligence. I can think of no better way to start that series, with two of my friends and colleagues who actually run our Center on Artificial Intelligence. The title of this episode is \u201cArtificial Intelligence is Here.\u201d As you will hear, we\u2019ll do episodes on artificial intelligence in sports, artificial intelligence in real estate, artificial intelligence in health care. But I think it\u2019s best to start just with the basics. I\u2019m very happy to have join with me today, first, my colleague Kartik Hosanagar. Kartik is the John C. Hower Professor at the Wharton School. He\u2019s also, as I mentioned, the co-director of our Center on Artificial Intelligence at Wharton. And normally, I don\u2019t read someone\u2019s bio. First of all, it\u2019s only a few sentences. But I think this actually is important for our listeners to understand the breadth and also the practicality of Kartik\u2019s work. His research examines how AI impacts business and society, and something you\u2019ll hear about is, that is what our center does. There\u2019s kind of two prongs. Second, he was a founder of Yodle, where he applied AI to online advertising. And more recently and currently, to Jumpcut Media, a company applying AI to democratize Hollywood. He also teaches our courses on enabling technologies and AI business and society. Kartik, welcome. Kartik Hosanagar: Thanks for having me, Eric. Bradlow: I\u2019m also happy to have my colleague, Stefano Puntoni. Stefano is the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing here at the Wharton School. He\u2019s also, along with Kartik, the co-Director of our Center on AI at Wharton. And his research examines how artificial intelligence and automation are changing consumption and society. And similar to Kartik, he also teaches our courses on artificial intelligence, brand management, and marketing strategies. Stefano, welcome. Stefano Puntoni: Thank you very much. Bradlow: It\u2019s great to be with both of you. So maybe, Kartik, I\u2019ll throw the first question out to you. While artificial intelligence is now the big thing that every company is thinking about, what do you see as\u2014 well, first of all, maybe even before what are challenges facing companies, how would we even define what artificial intelligence is? Because it can mean lots of things. It could mean everything from taking texts and images and stuff like that, and kind of quantifying it, or it could be generative AI, which is the same side of the coin, but a different part. How do you even view, what does it mean to say \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d? Hosanagar: Yeah. Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science which is focused on getting computers to do the kinds of things that traditionally requires human intelligence. What that is, is a moving target. When computers couldn\u2019t play, say, a very simple game like\u2014 well, chess is not simple, but maybe even simpler board games. Maybe that\u2019s the target. And then when you say computers can play chess, and when that\u2019s easy for computers, we no longer think of that as AI. But really, today, when we think about what is AI, it\u2019s again, getting computers to do the kinds of things that require human intelligence. Like understand language. Like navigate the physical world. Like being able to learn from experiences, from data. So, all of that really is included in AI. Bradlow: Do you put any separation between what I call\u2014 maybe I\u2019m not even using the right words \u2014 traditional AI, which again back in my old days, we\u2019ve had AI around, \u201cHow do you take an image, and turn it into something?\u201d \u201cHow do we take video, how do we take text?\u201d That\u2019s one form of AI versus what\u2019s got everybody excited today, which is ChatGPT, which is a form of large language model. Do you put any differentiation there? Or that\u2019s just a way for us to understand. One is creation of data, and the other one is using it in an application of forecast and language. Hosanagar: Yeah, I feel there is some distinction. But ultimately, they\u2019re closely related. Because what we think of as the more traditional AI, or predictive AI, it\u2019s all about taking data and understanding the landscape of the data. And to be able to say, \u201cIn this region of the data,\u201d let\u2019s say you\u2019re predicting whether an image is about Bob, or is it about Lisa? And so you kind of say, \u201cIn the image space, this region, if the shape of the colors are like this, the shape of the eyes are like this, then it\u2019s Bob. In that area, it\u2019s Lisa.\u201d And so on. So, it\u2019s mostly understanding the space of data, and being able to say, with emails, is it fraudulent or not? And saying which portion of the space does it have one value versus the other. Now, once you started getting really good at predicting that, then you can start to use those predictions to create. And that\u2019s where it\u2019s the next step, where it becomes generative AI. Where now you are predicting, what\u2019s the next word? You might as well use it to start generating text, and start generating sentences, essays and novels, and so on. Bradlow: Stefano, let me ask you a question. If one went to your web site on the Wharton web site \u2014 and by the way. Just for our listeners, Stefano has a lot of deep training in statistics. But most people would say, \u201cYou\u2019re not a computer scientist. You\u2019re not a mathematician. What the hell do you have to do with artificial intelligence?\u201d Like, \u201cWhat role does consumer psychology play in artificial intelligence today? Isn\u2019t it just for us math types?\u201d Puntoni: If you talk to companies and you ask them why did your analytics program fail, you almost never hear the answer, \u201cBecause the models don\u2019t work. Because the techniques didn\u2019t deliver.\u201d It\u2019s never about the technical stuff. It\u2019s always about people. It\u2019s about lack of vision. It\u2019s about the lack of alignment between decision makers and analysts. It\u2019s about the lack of clarity about why we do analytics. So, I think that a behavioral science perspective on analytics can bring a lot of benefits to try to understand how do we connect decisions in companies to the data that we have? That takes both the technical skills and the human insights, the psychology insights. I think bringing those together, I find that has a lot of value and a lot of potential insights. A lot of low-hanging fruits, in fact, in companies, I think. Bradlow: As a follow-up question, we all read these articles that say 70% of the jobs are going to go away, and robots or automation or AI is going to put me out of business. Should employees be happy with what\u2019s going on in AI? Or the answer is, it depends who you are and what you\u2019re doing? What are your thoughts? And then Kartik, I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on that, including the work you\u2019re doing at Jumpcut. Because we all know one of the biggest issues in the current writer\u2019s strike was actually what\u2019s going to happen with artificial intelligence? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts from the psychology or the employee motivation perspective, and then, what are you seeing actually out in the real world? Puntoni: The academic answer to any question would be, \u201cIt depends. It depends.\u201d But in my research, what I\u2019ve been looking at is the extent to which people perceive automation as a threat. And what we find is that oftentimes when tasks are being automated by AI, for example, our tasks have to have some kind of meaning to the person. That they are essential to the way that they see themselves, for example, in their professional identity. That can create a lot of threat. So, you have psychological threats, and then you have these objective threats of maybe jobs on the line. And maybe you\u2019ll feel happy about knowing that I try out the professor job on some of these scoring algorithms, and we are fairly safe from our own replacement. Bradlow: Kartik, let me ask you. And let me just preface this with saying, you probably don\u2019t even know about this. Fifteen years ago, I wrote a paper with a former colleague and a doctoral student about how to use\u2014 I didn\u2019t call it AI back then. But how to, basically, in large scale, compute features of advertisements and optimally design advertisements based on a massive number of features. And I remember the reaction. I first thought I was going to get rich. I went to every big media agency and said, \u201cYou can fire all your creative people. I know how to create these ads using mathematics.\u201d And I was looked at like I had four heads. So, can you bring us up to the year 2023? Can you tell us what you\u2019re doing at Jumpcut, and what role AI machine learning plays in your company, and just what you see going on in the creative world? Hosanagar: Yeah. And I\u2019ll connect that to, also, what you and Stefano just brought up about AI and jobs and exposure to AI and so on. I just came from a real estate conference. And the panel before I spoke was talking about, \u201cHey, this artificial intelligence, it\u2019s not really intelligence. It just replicates whatever in some data. The true human intelligence is creative, problem-solving, and so on.\u201d And I was sharing over there that there are multiple studies now that talk about what can AI do, and cannot do. For example, my colleague, Daniel Rock, has a study where he shows that just LLMs, meaning large language models like ChatGPT, and before the advan",

Transcript Eric Bradlow: Welcome everyone to the latest edition of the Analytics at Wharton, AI at Wharton podcast series. We\u2019re doing a series here on artificial intelligence. Today\u2019s episode is looking to be extremely exciting. I\u2019m happy to be joined today by two of my colleagues. The first is \u201cZab\u201d Elizabeth Johnson, who is the executive director and senior fellow of the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative. And my colleague Michael Platt, who \u2014 this will take a minute, listeners \u2014 who is the faculty director of the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative. He\u2019s the James S. Riepe, Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor. He\u2019s in my home Department of Marketing. He\u2019s also in the Department of Neuroscience in the Perelman School of Medicine. He\u2019s also in the psychology department in the School of Arts and Sciences. Michael and Zab, welcome to our podcast. Zab Johnson: Thanks for having us, Eric. Michael Platt: Yes, thanks Eric. It\u2019s great to be here. Bradlow: Why don\u2019t we start with the basics? Zab, I\u2019ll start with you. For our listeners who don\u2019t know, of course they can go to your website and see all about it, but what is the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative? And then we\u2019ll get into what it has to do with our episode today, AI and Neuroscience. Johnson: Great. The Wharton Neuroscience Initiative is a research center under Analytics at Wharton here at the Wharton School. Really, what we\u2019re doing is to help businesses, individuals, and society writ large to understand why neuroscience might impact their lives. We\u2019re working on all different levels, both education, of course \u2014 here we are the University of Pennsylvania, trying to lead the charge in encouraging curiosity and engagement in the neurosciences writ large. We\u2019re not trying to change business students into neuroscientists, but we want them to be aware of what the power of looking under the hood is, at brain activity itself. And then we have research, an active research portfolio. A lot of times we do that in conjunction with companies to answer and think about questions that haven\u2019t yet had an academic and practice partnership, to do bigger and better things out in the wild. Of course, engagement is really our third pillar. It\u2019s encouraging people to think very broadly about this 3-pound organ that they have inside their heads and to think about how that might impact their lives, their own individual work, and how they live their lives. Bradlow: Michael, maybe a question for you. I\u2019ve always said that people ask me what I do for a living, and I say, \u201cI\u2019m a professor. I\u2019m a statistician.\u201d But I really say, \u201cI\u2019m a professional data-chaser. I chase interesting forms of data.\u201d Could you tell us, since you and I are the same age, we\u2019ve been in academia the same basic amount of time. How has technology changed the field of neuroscience? When I was a young researcher, you had to put people over in an fMRI machine, if those even existed. You\u2019ll even tell me if those existed 30 years ago. We had the people in fMRI to get brain activity. How has technology just changed that aspect of what you do? Platt: That\u2019s a great question, and I think that what\u2019s interesting from the perspective of neuroscience is the kind of data that we get. So, it\u2019s not directly observable data. It\u2019s not data that people can verbally express typically because we don\u2019t have good access to what\u2019s going on in their heads, and just being asked changes our appreciation of that. Technology in neuroscience is bewildering now, so it is just every year and every day, just exploding the myriad ways in which we can measure and actually manipulate brain structure and brain function. The vast majority of those technologies are not really readily applied to humans, because they would involve putting something in your head. Now that said, there is an active race in the private sector even right now, Neuralink being one amongst many companies that is creating and building implants with a vision that someday, maybe all of us will be perfectly happy to have some sort of technology within our heads that could allow us to communicate with computers, even communicate with each other. But fMRI still exists. It has been around for some 40 years, but it is still a really great tool for peering deep into the brain. But it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s cumbersome, it\u2019s not very scalable. You can\u2019t put it on a consumer\u2019s head while they\u2019re walking around shopping at Walmart, or on your employee\u2019s head while they\u2019re at work. So, we reserve it for specific kinds of studies, like to test hypotheses about why did somebody make a risk-averse decision, versus not. It provides kind of a foundation. What we try to do from there is to use that as a springboard for applying other, more scalable, technologies that can be done with many more people in a lighter-weight, cheaper kind of fashion that\u2019s more useful for business. I think that\u2019s where we are, in a really exciting place in the last decade, especially in the last couple of years, which is the development of very high signal quality, wearable neurotechnology. There\u2019s a whole variety of gizmos that are on the market or coming to market. We\u2019ll talk about this some more, obviously, but yoking that, combining that with advances in AI and machine learning puts us in a position to really capitalize on the ability to measure brain activity in the real world at scale, thousands, maybe millions of people in a much wider array of activities than is possible in the laboratory. So that\u2019s going to give us incredible new insights, I believe. Bradlow: One of the things, as both of you know, that we asked you to do before this episode was to write a set of questions that I could ask you. And this episode is no different. As a matter of fact, Zab and I joked before you got here, Michael. She joked with me, \u201cWho do you think wrote these questions, us or ChatGPT?\u201d \u2014 which is a perfect segue to my first question. Either one of you can answer this. As a matter of fact, this is one of those times when I\u2019m asking a question where I actually really, really don\u2019t know the answer. What is organic intelligence, and how is this different from artificial intelligence? Zab, I\u2019ll start with you. What is organic, artificial? What does that mean to you as someone who\u2019s trained in neuroscience? Johnson: I think it starts with just thinking about organic matter, right? In general, organic intelligence is used in the domain when it\u2019s carbon-based. Bradlow: That\u2019s what I have. Johnson: Yes, so that\u2019s what you have, the wet, gooey stuff that\u2019s inside. But also all of the animal kingdom has that. So, you can argue about intelligence and different metrics of intelligence, and we can talk about that later. But in general, it\u2019s this idea that you have a nervous system that\u2019s carbon-based that has a certain kind of behavior and integrates signals in a certain kind of chemical and electrical system that\u2019s carbon-based. I think in opposition to what we classically think of as AI, AI is done in silica, right? That\u2019s the way it has been so far. We\u2019ll see if we start to grow artificially in the lab using wet stuff. That might change, and I think some people would argue that there is already still carbon involved. But I think the root of what people think of as this definition is based on actually having a nervous system, rather than not having a nervous system and doing it artificially. Bradlow: Another interesting question that you guys put down is: What are some common traits shared between AI systems and the human brain? Or let me ask you another question. Should people who are building artificial intelligence systems today\u2013 do they have a team of neuroscientists working with them? Because in some ways, if one of the goals of artificial intelligence is to mimic human intelligence, shouldn\u2019t we actually understand how the human brain works before we try to build systems that are trying to mimic some aspects of that? Platt: Well, I think there are several questions here, which is what are the goals of AI, like in AI researchers? One might be to mimic the properties of human neurosystems, but maybe we can do it in a different way. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now. Maybe we can even go beyond the capabilities of human intelligence. I think that there are a number of different commonalities between the two, and it\u2019s kind of interesting when you think historically about where some of the basic algorithms and machine learning, like reinforcement learning came from. They actually had an origin in psychology and in neuroscience. So it has kind of been this really interesting feedback. Bradlow: I never thought about that. Would what Pavlov did with his experiments, would those be considered reinforcement learning? Platt: Those are the origins of reinforcement learning, and actually the basic reinforcement learning model was really written out here by a professor in psychology, Bob Rescorla, back in the 1960s and early \u201970s. Penn has a really important part in the history of the development of AI. But for a long time, I think that we looked at the human brain or animal brains in general, and yes, reinforcement learning is important for learning to navigate and learning what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad, what to approach, what to avoid. But maybe it didn\u2019t go much deeper than that, and then there were these sorts of circuits. And this is certainly true, circuits that have prescribed functions that are sort of built in, if you will, kind of hard-wired. And the other thing is that there are constrain",

Transcript Eric Bradlow: Welcome, everyone, to the current edition of the Wharton AI Sirius XM podcast series here on artificial intelligence. I\u2019m Eric Bradlow, vice dean of analytics here at the Wharton School. Also, the K.P. Chao Professor of Marketing Statistics and Data Science. Today\u2019s episode, as all of our episodes are, is sponsored by Analytics at Wharton and AI at Wharton, and today we\u2019re going to talk about a topic that I think it\u2019s hard to walk down the street or talk to anyone in business and not have them speak about, which is AI in human resources. So I\u2019m joined here today by two of my colleagues. The first is my colleague from the Management Department, Matthew Bidwell. Matthew is the Xingmei Zhang and Yongge Dai Professor, a professor in the Management Department. He\u2019s also the faculty director of a center that\u2019s a big part of Analytics at Wharton, Wharton People Analytics Initiative. And he\u2019s also the academic director of Wharton\u2019s Center for Human Resources Program. Matthew, welcome here to our show. Matthew Bidwell: Thank you very much for bringing me on, Eric. Bradlow: It\u2019s great to have you here. I\u2019m also joined by my colleague, Sonny Tambe. Sonny is an associate professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School, and also teaches many of our courses on AI. So Sonny, welcome to the show. Sonny Tambe: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Bradlow: It\u2019s great to have you both on such an important topic. Let me start with the beginning. Matthew, maybe I\u2019ll start with you. Since you are the faculty director now of Wharton People Analytics, how do you think AI is going to affect the way that we manage people? What are both the concerns that you have, and equally importantly, what are the big opportunities? Bidwell: Big question. I mean, obviously we need to think a little bit about how we define AI. These days, when we think about AI, we kind of leap straight to ChatGPT and large language models, and so on. Bradlow: Or what a lot of people would call the generative AI part, where the computer, the large language model, is generating a response. Bidwell: Yeah. You know, if you look back historically over the last five years, people have used AI almost to describe anything that involves numbers. So it\u2019s a broad range. You know, I think with any of these technologies, as ever, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to improve how we manage people, when we look at how people are managed, so much of what goes on is kind of gut decision-making, this kind of intuition. And we have pretty much a century of research suggesting that our guts are terrible decision-makers. That actually, there\u2019s a reason why we should be thinking with our brains rather than our stomachs. And so more broadly, when we are more systematic, when we are more thoughtful, when we rely on data in making decisions \u2014 who do we hire, who do we promote, how do we manage people \u2014 all those sorts of things \u2014 we usually make much better decisions. And so I think the extent to which AI helps us be more systematic in doing that, it\u2019s going to be really helpful. It\u2019s already being helpful. There are obviously big concerns. I think three spring to mind. One big concern everybody has is bias and discrimination. Again, we know there\u2019s a lot of bias in the labor market. We know our guts are discriminating all of the time. The good news is, probably most of the time AI is going to be less discriminatory. But we think it\u2019s going to be discriminatory. Particularly when we look at some of these more sophisticated large language models, right? They have been trained on the corpus of data that is out on the internet. Even when people aren\u2019t being deliberately sexist and racist, that embodies a whole set of cultural assumptions. So take sexism, for example. There\u2019s been some very nice studies that look at word imbedding models and other things that are trained on the corpus of text that you see on the internet, and they show, not surprisingly, that we think words to do with careers are more closely related to men\u2019s names, and words to do with home life and family are more closely related to women\u2019s names. And so once you start using those models to make decisions about employment, I think the risks of bias and discrimination are very serious. And I think one of the things we worry about particularly more generally with using algorithms rather than judgment in managing people is, if you have a manager that discriminates, that\u2019s a problem for the people working for that manager. If you have an algorithm that discriminates, the fact that I can apply a hiring algorithm at scale across an entire company, across an entire industry, the sheer volume of people that are potentially affected is huge. Bradlow: That\u2019s one of the advantages of scale and the disadvantages of scale. Bidwell: Yeah. And so I think that is a very live concern. If I can go on a little bit, just talk about my other two concerns \u2014 I know we have many other questions. But I think another couple of things that we\u2019re thinking about. Algorithms, like any technology, have often been applied in a fairly punitive way in HR. So I think the classic example of this is scheduling software. And so with scheduling software, it\u2019s very tempting. If you\u2019re an engineer, sitting in your office trying to do the right thing, you\u2019re like, \u201cHow do I increase productivity?\u201d And the way I increase productivity is by carefully matching people\u2019s schedules to shifts in demand during the day. And so I\u2019m running Starbucks. I want to give somebody a shift that starts at seven in the morning and then runs by ten. Well, by then we\u2019re through with the kind of office rush. And then I want them to go away for a while, so I don\u2019t have to pay them. And then maybe I want them to come back between four and six. And so what you find is, these schedules end up creating schedules that are great for the company but have proved terribly damaging for the people who actually have to try and fit their lives around what the algorithm thinks, and probably, frankly, end up causing long-term damage in the organization as well because you maximize that match between supply and demand, but you end up driving up attrition, as people won\u2019t stay with those sorts of schedules. And so I think there\u2019s a broader issue. It\u2019s always a tension in managing people. How much do you take into account what those people think? But I think when you have people managed by AI, you have a bunch of assumptions that are being baked in by the schedulers, by the engineers, whoever. They\u2019re increasingly detached from what\u2019s going on in the ground. And I think that that often leads to some really bad and destructive decisions. And so I think done well, we can incorporate a lot of these algorithms and manage people better. But it does require us to really think about how these algorithms are being used, and to have kind of that closed loop. So we engineer something, and then we say, \u201cOkay. What\u2019s actually happening?\u201d And we\u2019re very alive to the problems it\u2019s creating and go back and reengineer it. I think when you kind of just sit down, do an optimalization problem, and then kind of put it out into the world and let everybody suffer the problems, that creates a lot of damage, too. So those are some of the things I\u2019m worrying about. Bradlow: I think one of the things that we always talk about is that, first of all, what is the objective function you\u2019re optimizing? That\u2019s the first thing. And I think we would all agree \u2014 and I\u2019ll turn it over to Sonny in just a second \u2014 would be, you know, these things should be a decision support tool. The minute you automate them, you have those dangers of, you know, if you\u2019d like, maximizing some objective that may not be good for the employees, and certainly may not be good for the firm. So Sonny, let me turn things over to you. I know for a number of years, you\u2019ve been one of our pioneers in teaching AI to our students. What\u2019s changed? Why is everyone so excited today? I\u2019m a statistician. I\u2019ve been here at Wharton for 28 years. We\u2019ve been doing big data science for a long time. What\u2019s unique, and what\u2019s changed about today, that\u2019s made everybody want to take your class, everybody be interested in every single thing you\u2019re working on? Tambe: I think you touched on it just a second ago. But this tension between decision [and] support, which is what a lot of technology has been doing for a few generations now, moving to this world of potentially either recommending a decision or even automating decisions. And what we do at work all day is make decisions, right? That\u2019s what businesses do. It\u2019s what organizations are optimized to do. And so a technology that can make decisions or recommend decisions has implications for all parts of the organization. People compare it to electricity. It has the potential to change everything. I think that\u2019s one part of the reason people are energized about this particular topic. The other thing that\u2019s exciting but also somewhat concerning is that I think there\u2019s more unpredictability right now around AI than there has been for tools past, right? So we think about, as we scale up these models, people are seeing more emerging capabilities that they would not have expected, right? Bradlow : Let me press you on just this one topic for a second. I can imagine uncertainty in a few things. One is, I type something into a large language model. ChatGPT, Bing AI, et cetera. Something comes out. I typ",

      "content_text": "Loading the Elevenlabs Text to Speech AudioNative Player\u2026 Investors in the $4 trillion U.S. municipal bond market are paying more for bonds with credible environmental, social, and governance information, even when those bonds are not officially labeled as \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csocial.\u201d That is the key finding of a new study into the green bonds market, co-authored by Wharton finance professor Daniel Garrett , Penn PhD student Mahdi Shahrabi , and Oregon State University professor Brian Gibbons . It shows that municipal bonds with third-party ESG scores trade at higher prices, signaling cheaper borrowing costs for issuers. On average, yields \u2014 which move inversely to prices \u2014 dropped by 3 to 4 basis points when a bond received an ESG score, even if it had no formal label. An ESG score is a third-party assessment of a bond\u2019s environmental, social, or governance features. A label, by contrast, is a formal designation \u2014 like \u201cgreen bond\u201d \u2014 from the issuer that requires meeting strict international criteria. The distinction matters. The researchers estimate that, between March and December 2023, investors were willing to pay about $1.3 billion more in total for bonds that received ESG scores, based on observed price changes following the public release of the data. Most of that \u2014 about two-thirds \u2014 went to bonds that were not eligible for any official label. \u201cThe takeaway is clear: The market values ESG information. Issuers who ignore it can leave money on the table,\u201d said Garrett. \u201cThe takeaway is clear: The market values ESG information.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Garrett How ESG Scores Boost Bond Value Municipal bonds are loans to local governments and public agencies, used to finance schools, roads, water systems, and other public services. The study examined what happened when, in March 2023, Bloomberg Terminals began displaying ESG scores for roughly one-quarter of the U.S. municipal bond market \u2014 about $1 trillion in debt \u2014 making them visible to a broader set of investors. These terminals are ubiquitous in investment and trading. The ESG scores came from Kestrel, a private company, and were displayed on Bloomberg whether or not the bond was officially labeled as green or social. In total, Kestrel has scored about 125,000 bonds worth $1.8 trillion, which formed the basis of the analysis. The central finding was simple: Bond prices went up once they received an ESG score. Bonds with stronger environmental or transparency ratings saw a slightly bigger bump \u2014 a \u201cgreenium\u201d of about 1 to 2 basis points, reflecting the extra premium investors place on higher ESG quality. By contrast, there was no premium for bonds with high social scores, underscoring that investors placed more value on new environmental and governance information. The larger boost was what the researchers call the \u201cassessment effect\u201d \u2014 a 3 to 4 basis point drop in yields for any bond that received a score, regardless of how high or low it rated. And most of that gain, worth about $870 million, went to bonds that did not qualify for any official ESG label. Garrett said: \u201cInvestors are pricing this information regardless of labels. Once the scores were published, bonds with stronger ratings improved more in value, while those with weaker gained less.\u201d The price premium was especially large for riskier bonds: Yields fell by about 9 basis points for those with weaker credit ratings, and by as much as 10 basis points for other riskier bonds, such as those backed by income from specific projects like toll roads or water systems, rather than by broad tax revenues. Garrett said this shows ESG scores can complement traditional credit ratings. \u201cCredit rating agencies are trying to predict default,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying they are wrong, but there can be other sources of risk that credit ratings alone do not capture.\u201d \u201cOnce the [ESG] scores were published, bonds with stronger ratings improved more in value, while those with weaker gained less.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Garrett Why Issuers Aren\u2019t Labeling Municipal Bonds That left the question of who was driving the demand for bonds labeled as \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csocial.\u201d One possible explanation was demand from mutual funds with explicit objectives to invest in these types of financial instruments. But green funds made up less than 0.5% of the market, holding only about $1 billion in labeled bonds before the new scores were released \u2014 not enough to explain the full effect. The bulk of labeled debt was held by mainstream funds, suggesting that the price changes came mainly from ordinary investors. Yet despite this clear demand, most municipal bonds are still issued without ESG information. The question is why, and the researchers point to politics and demographics. Even when a project qualifies, issuers in Republican-leaning areas were less likely to use one. A 16% increase in Republican vote share cut the likelihood of labeling by about 9 percentage points. By contrast, more concern about climate change raised the odds of labeling by about 12 percentage points. In places with more Hispanic or nonwhite residents, labeling was 7 to 12 percentage points less likely, though the study does not explain why. Cost is another barrier. To get a green label, issuers need the staff and expertise to certify that a project qualifies, and it is common to hire an outside firm for a second opinion. These reviews usually cost several thousand dollars \u2014 sometimes tens of thousands. Such costs barely register on a $100 million bond but might be more relevant on a $5 million issue. \u201cMunicipal bonds are often issued by local school districts,\u201d said Garrett. \u201cThose officials may not be financially sophisticated or equipped to assess their ESG impact.\u201d That lack of expertise can be costly. Even a small drop in yields \u2014 just 3 basis points on a $100 million bond \u2014 translates into roughly $120,000 in present value savings. Municipalities that provide credible ESG information can capture those savings, even if they never apply for a formal label. As Garrett puts it, \u201cOur estimates suggest it would pass cost-benefit muster for most borrowers to go to an agency and ask them to describe those risks to investors.\u201d ESG information is already influencing bond prices, regardless of whether issuers provide it.\u00a0The question is whether issuers will take control of the story, or keep leaving money on the table.",

This interview is part of a special 10-part series called \u201cAI in Focus.\u201d Watch the video or read the full transcript below. Transcript Eric Bradlow: Welcome to the next episode of the Analytics at Wharton, AI at Wharton podcast series on artificial intelligence. While I\u2019ve enjoyed all the episodes, today is really a special one for me. Not just because of my love of sports, but of course because I\u2019m interviewing two of my colleagues and co-hosts of another show here on Sirius XM, Wharton Moneyball. It\u2019s my honor to introduce my colleague, Cade Massey. Cade is a practice professor in our operations, information and decisions department. He teaches researchers and consults on how to improve decision-making in organizations. And probably the part\u2013 you could not have written it better than this, thank you, Cade\u2014 especially by blending models and experts. He\u2019s also the faculty director of Wharton People Lab, faculty co-director of the Wharton Sports Analytics and Business Initiative. And of course, as I mentioned, co-host of Wharton Moneyball. Cade, welcome to our podcast. Cade Massey: Thanks, Eric. Delighted to be here. Bradlow: I\u2019m also joined by my longtime friend and colleague in the statistics and data science department, Adi Wyner. I really think it\u2019s important to read Adi\u2019s short bio here, because of all the different things he\u2019s doing around data science, statistics, and artificial intelligence at the school. Adi is a professor of statistics and data science whose research has spanned many areas including applied probability modeling, information theory, and machine learning. He\u2019s written many articles in statistical methodology, and also applications including other episodes like we\u2019ve had just now \u2014 neuroscience, medicine, climate science, and of course, extensively in sports analytics, where along with Cade, he\u2019s the co-director of our Sports Analytics Business Initiative. He also runs the Penn Sports Research Seminar, the summertime Moneyball Academy, and he\u2019s also one of my co-hosts of Wharton Moneyball. And he\u2019s the director of the undergraduate program in statistics and data science. So Adi, welcome to the podcast. Adi Wyner: Yes, thank you. Great to be here. Bradlow: And that completes our 28 minutes of talking today. But let\u2019s get serious. So Adi, why don\u2019t we start with the following, and this is a question I get all the time. And I imagine you do, too. What is AI? And how does it differ, if any, with what you and I might call statistics? Wyner: Well, it is actually a great, great blending of the two. I mean, statistics has been around a long time. If we go back, historically, AI was designed to try to figure out how people think and build models that do that. And then sometime in the \u201890s, people realized that the smart way to do artificial intelligence is not try to reconstruct the thought process, but just get tons of data. And this was a huge breakthrough. I think it really happened in the \u201890s in machine translation and in speech recognition. Bradlow: And then eventually vision. Wyner: And then eventually vision. What happened was, instead of trying to actually build machine learning and artificial intelligence, people discovered that the right way to do that was statistics. Now fast forward to today. We still have statistics, and we have machine learning and AI. And they are still somewhat similar, and also different. I have a rule of thumb about what kinds of problems are machine learning and what kinds of problems are statistics, although you have to remember, there\u2019s enormous feedback and intersection between the two. And we all use each other\u2019s methods. The way I like to think about it is this. What is the difficulty in solving the problem? And if the difficulty is complexity \u2014 for example, vision, self-driving cars, image recognition, trying to take the entirety of the web and use that to answer a question, like you think of large language models \u2014 that\u2019s AI. Something that a human can do, and now you\u2019re trying to get the machine to do it. Statistics is all about what I would think of as noisy problems. We have a colleague in criminology who tries to predict whether or not someone commits a crime after they\u2019ve been in jail for a while. Recidivism. Well, you\u2019re never going to get a perfect prediction. Sports is a classic place where a lot of our problems are statistics. For example, trying to figure out, you know, what your batting average is going to be next year, or things like that. But also, other problems come up in areas which are common to both, where there is a lot of signal, but also you can handle them with statistical methods. The way I generally describe it is what we would call signal versus the noise. And the machine learning problems have high signal, low noise, and the statistics problem have high noise and lower signal. Bradlow: Cade, let me ask you, related to that, maybe one could argue that statistics has gotten its footing in companies and decision-making. Maybe you could argue machine learning has, because people like to predict things that can help predict the future. AI is kind of new. How do you see companies reacting to these different methods? And are we now in such a \u2014 I\u2019ll call it an \u201cenlightened explosion world,\u201d like everyone\u2019s just saying, \u201cOf course I have to adopt that.\u201d Or is that not the reality of today? Massey: Well, certainly organizations are looking at opportunities for it, and they\u2019re excited about it. And certainly, vendors who think they have a new application for it are selling the potential of that. But ultimately it always comes back to, is somebody going to rely on that algorithm or model for a decision? They have to use the dang thing. \u00a0It\u2019s one thing for it to spin and do pretty things. It\u2019s another for a human to depend on it. And what we\u2019ve seen, reliably, is that that\u2019s a pretty steep hill to climb. That people are loathe to trust decisions to models when models aren\u2019t perfect. And in many, many applications, models are inevitably imperfect. As soon as we see them be imperfect, we\u2019re reluctant to lean on them. Even if we know humans are imperfect. There\u2019s an asymmetry between the penalties humans apply to models that are imperfect, versus humans that are imperfect. As soon as they see that imperfect performance, they\u2019d rather lean on a human. Bradlow: If I\u2019m going to use an algorithm and offload some of it, that has to be much more accurate than in some sense, we as fallible humans. Massey: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve observed. We, along with some colleagues at Penn, we\u2019ve called that algorithm aversion. And again, it\u2019s not to say that people just innately don\u2019t trust models. We\u2019re happy to play with models, to lean on models. But if we see them performing perfectly, we\u2019re much harsher in our treatment of them than we are humans. Bradlow: Adi, I know you wanted to jump in here. And let\u2019s get to you before we jump into the main topic of today, which of course are all of our passion, which is AI and sports. But please, you had a follow up. Wyner: I guess my follow up to you, Cade, is that I think we might want to privilege a human versus a model when they both make mistakes at approximately the same rate. But how much is that disadvantage? Do we really kill models, even if they\u2019re better than humans, just because they make mistakes? Massey: Yeah. I can\u2019t speak to the exact threshold where you might go back to the model, but where we\u2019ve run experiments, we\u2019ve manipulated exactly that. And people can observe that the model outperforms. But they hold models to a higher standard. There seems to be a model of a standard of perfection for models that they don\u2019t use when it comes to humans. Bradlow: Well, Adi, let\u2019s jump in first with you with the application of AI and sports analytics. What do you see, as you mentioned statistics being the field of \u2014 let me just see if I got this right. Clearly, AI is, you\u2019re going to have low noise, massive data. Statistics, we\u2019re going to have typically smaller data sets, high noise, which means you have to rely more on mathematical models for decision-making. How do you see sports analytics today? How much of it do you see the use of statistics? How much do you see the use of AI? Is there some combination? What do you see happening right now? Wyner: Certainly, there\u2019s an incredible amount of statistics. And the reason why statistics is being used so much today, primarily, is people see the value in it. I think that\u2019s been a giant sea change over the years brought about by the Moneyball revolution, Oakland A\u2019s, et cetera, et cetera. People realize that using data to make decisions is a great thing to do. And that data wasn\u2019t advanced. I mean, Bill James really revolutionized sports analytics with counting and percentages and clever ways of adding and subtracting things. Not fancy. So, statistics has certainly become essential to the operation of successful sports teams. And in lots of ways, player evaluations. None of this is particularly complex. There are, of course, machine learning advances that have been made that have been useful. Certainly, the tracking data. And that\u2019s for decision-making on something that we argue about on our radio show all the time. Should we have a robotic umpire? We certainly have the Hawkeye data in baseball. We have all this tracking data from SportsVision and Sportsview, that tracks where the ball is and where the players are. And that leads to mixture models \u2014 statistics mixed with machine learning, which is these massively giant tracking data. Terabytes of information that need to be processed so you can still build statistical models. They\u2019re still high noise, in the sense that we\u2019re not able yet to predict whether or not, say, a ru",

Goal Achieve growth by managing the interplay and avoiding conflict between customer segments. Nano Tool Growth is exciting \u2014 until your customers start pulling you in different directions. One segment craves premium exclusivity, while another demands mass accessibility. Some want innovation, while others value tradition. These tensions don\u2019t always surface immediately, but when they do, they can erode brand loyalty, confuse messaging, and stall business momentum. Accurately assessing the risks of conflict between customer segments requires understanding the pieces of the conflict puzzle \u2014 namely, what different customer segments want and expect from the brand, what the brand means to those customers, the extent to which that meaning can be stretched to include new customers, and the competitive and cultural forces at play in the marketplace. Action Steps 1. Know thy customer. Instead of identifying customer segments based on demographics, focus on the value they derive from your offerings. Then, name each segment in a way that clearly reflects its core motivation. This helps you anticipate how different segments might align \u2014 or clash \u2014 as your brand grows. Ask: What functional value does this customer segment get from your brand\u2019s products and services, if any? What value does this customer segment derive from your brand\u2019s meaning or image, such as emotional or psychological value, if any? What identity-signaling value does this customer segment get from your brand, if any? What ideological value does this customer segment have that might intersect with your brand, if any? 2. Know thy brand. Knowing your brand in the context of anticipating conflict requires understanding what your brand means to customers at the segment level and determining the \u201cstretchability\u201d of your brand\u2019s meaning to include new customer segments and their values, preferences, and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 ideologies. Ask: What is the meaning of your brand to customers? Are there ways you can make the meaning or purpose of your brand more abstract, general, or encompassing to serve new customer segments? Is your brand positioned as inclusive or exclusive? How does that influence which new customer segments you can reasonably attract without generating conflict? 3. Know thy marketplace. Conflict is contextual: Awareness of relevant societal, political, cultural, environmental, and competitive forces that might influence intersegment relationships is vital for anticipating conflict. Ask: To what extent are hot-button political, social, or cultural topics relevant and important to the segments you serve or want to serve? Are any of your segments, or potential segments, on opposite sides of these topics? How relevant are they to your brand or messaging? How substitutable is your offering, and to what extent are the switching costs for consuming an alternative to your offering low or high? How Companies Do It The North Face\u00a0expanded beyond outdoor gear into streetwear, risking a disconnect with its core adventurer base. To bridge the gap between hikers and urban creatives, the brand centered its messaging on a shared value:\u00a0exploration.\u00a0By reframing its long-standing tagline \u201cNever Stop Exploring\u201d to include both mountain summits and city streets, The North Face linked diverse customer segments through a unifying mindset \u2014 curiosity and courage \u2014 reducing friction and preserving brand authenticity as it grew. When LEGO first discovered that a significant number of adults were purchasing their products for personal enjoyment, the company initially made no effort to target or engage this segment. However, facing bankruptcy in the early 2000s, LEGO shifted its approach. It began collaborating with adult fans to develop new models tailored to adult preferences and skill levels, pricing these products higher than their traditional lines. The company also created official online communities and conventions for adult builders. As a result, LEGO\u2019s adult market has grown more than fourfold over the past decade.

After earning his PhD in labor economics from Oxford University, Cappelli launched a career that has taken him around the globe as one of the most sought-after experts in management and human resources. He spoke with Wharton Dean Erika James about how the business world has transformed in the last 40 years from employee-driven to greater executive control, how a college education isn\u2019t the same experience it used to be, and how he\u2019s motivated to research topics that \u201cirritate\u201d him, including discrimination against women and older workers. Cappelli, who serves as the director of Wharton\u2019s Center for Human Resources , also shares personal details about dealing with chronic fatigue syndrome. This talk is part of the series \u201cWhat I\u2019ve Learned,\u201d which puts the spotlight on Wharton faculty who have made a lasting impact on their fields.

James: Glad that you\u2019re here. I\u2019d like to start with an origin story of sorts. If you were to think back across the span of your life, what are two or three experiences that propelled you for a career in higher education and in labor economics more specifically? Cappelli: I would say getting to college was a transformative time for most everybody. I have a pretty big case of attention deficit disorder, which was not treated. Of course, they didn\u2019t even know what it was, right? But when I got to college, I realized if I could lock myself in the library and study, then I could focus and get things done. I went from being a not particularly distinguished high school student to a distinguished college student. So, that was certainly one of them. I would say, as with many of our colleagues here, we didn\u2019t necessarily set out to be faculty members. A large number of us intended to be lawyers. At least when I was in college, if you were good in science, you wanted to be a doctor. If you were good in everything else, you want to be a lawyer. My father was a lawyer, so that sort of made sense. But my father died when I was in college, so that derailed that ambition a little bit. Maybe that was the other one. But then I was in graduate school. I went to Oxford with the idea of just goofing around for a while and coming back here, and I discovered you couldn\u2019t do that. You had to enter a degree program. I did that, and I was not quite done, so I got a post doc at MIT, and then I kind of woke up, and I was a professor. I was already down the pike a little bit without so much a conscious choice early on, saying this is what I was going to do. I didn\u2019t know an awful lot about careers. I didn\u2019t know what business careers were like. I didn\u2019t know what consulting jobs were like, nor did anybody else at Oxford. I went to see the careers people at one point, and they said, \u201cYou have the rest of your life to worry about your career. Don\u2019t worry about it now.\u201d Very different advice than what we got here. James: Very different advice. How did you come to learn about the field that you chose to study and pursue? Cappelli: As an undergraduate, I was around a lot of these topics. I was interested in the issue of how we regulate economic forces. I was interested in the legislative efforts to try to constrain, guide, harness economic forces, and particularly not crush people in the process. In England, labor economics looked a little different. It wasn\u2019t dominated by large data sets, and econometrics. It was much more go get data and look at it. It looks more like what we do here than what you would see in an economics department. James: You were in graduate school in the late \u201870s. It was the time period where labor unions were starting to decline, and there was an emergence in the management literature on different theories of management. How did that shift influence your own work? Cappelli: Career changes, right? I wrote my thesis about inflation, and as soon as I finished it, inflation kind of disappeared. That topic was gone. When I came to the Wharton School, there were still seven people here who studied unions, right? It used to be that, if you looked in corporations, the executive vice president was industrial relations, and the human resources reported to the industrial relations people. Part of my early career when I came back to the U.S. was studying what caused these unions to collapse. It wasn\u2019t just global economic pressures. It was a concerted effort by employers who had decided that the old bargain that you just should accept unions and strikes and not try to fight them \u2014 they didn\u2019t buy that any longer. It was a shift in values, I think, that led companies to take off the gloves, as it were, and started to take the unions apart. That started in 1981, which was with the recession. It was, at the time, the worst recession since the Great Depression. And that was part of it, was dismantling unions. Part of what happened then is, \u201cOK, what do we have now?\u201d Because part of dismantling unions was also inside the great corporations restructuring themselves down to shrink. A lot of it was the belief that they were bloated, and they probably were, having grown up in period of regulation, stable markets, lots of planning, and that all kind of went out the window. So, that was probably me talking about that issue of what happens when we got rid of lifetime employment. That was my work in the 1990s, trying to think about that. At the time, a lot of people didn\u2019t believe it had changed, because we had had that for 45 years, 50 years, that stable model of big corporations. It was just hard to believe that it disappeared that quickly but, in fact, it did. James: Speaking of change, and in some cases, transformational change pretty rapidly, remote work wasn\u2019t something we were talking about 10 years ago. We are now trying to actively navigate. As you think about some of these big contextual variables that are now influencing the workplace, what is your advice to organizations and leaders about how we should be thinking about and preparing? Advice to a dean or faculty how we should be preparing the workforce of the future, given the shifts that we\u2019re seeing? Cappelli: You see this in practice, but also in university. We have a really hard time with uncertainty, and we would love, love, love to be able to plan. And to plan, you really need certainty of some kind. I think the advice is we have to get more comfortable with uncertainty, and that planning when you have uncertainty is dangerous. You\u2019re assuming you\u2019re going in this direction, you start making investments in that direction, and then you discover that if you\u2019re wrong, you would have been better off just waiting. I think with AI in particular, we\u2019re absolutely in that right now. The assumptions we made about what was going to happen have been proven wrong. Like driverless trucks. By 2019, they were supposed to take over. Every consulting firm had made that story. They\u2019ve all taken those reports down off their websites now, just buried them someplace. But they all believed it, right? I think it happens because we really, really want to know what the answer is, and people are willing to tell you, but they don\u2019t know. I think the problem for us \u2014 we see this in executive ed \u2014 some of our colleagues here have been trying to persuade employers to think about this for maybe 10 years or so. How do you deal with uncertainty? You don\u2019t have to ignore it, but you don\u2019t have to just make a guess either. I think that\u2019s our problem. James: Would you say it\u2019s the same kind of perspective when you think about remote work and how we should be thinking about the management of a workforce, whether it\u2019s in person, whether it\u2019s hybrid, and the way in which technology has influenced how people can engage with the workplace? Cappelli: I think employers are really in the driver\u2019s seat on this. There\u2019s no country in the developed world where employers have more ability to control things in the U.S. They\u2019re making the calls. I think what concerns me is they\u2019re not making sensible calls on this. They\u2019re not thinking through what will work for us as an employer. In lots of places, they\u2019re just assuming that having people work remotely will be just like if they were in the office, right? And it\u2019s not. I think one of the things that we didn\u2019t understand before the pandemic and before remote work is how things actually got done in offices, and how much of it was relational-based. You need something done, you call this person that you know over here. Some of the research that we did, and some of the studies of hybrid workplaces discovered that that\u2019s still what they try to do. If we need something from that team over there, we say, \u201cWho in our team knows anybody over there?\u201d But the problem is with remote work continuing in some places, the average job tenure is four years. We have cohorts of employees in these companies who really don\u2019t know anybody there, because they were never face to face. We\u2019re kind of running down the stock of relational capital we\u2019ve got. Employers have to think about, how do we rebuild this so that people will figure out how to get things done? You could do it. Some of the companies like GitHub and the all-virtual companies have figured out ways to do it, but they got rule books that are like this thick, telling you, \u201cHere\u2019s how you have to describe what you\u2019re doing and keep a record of it so everybody can see it on a common document.\u201d I don\u2019t think most employers are willing to go to that much effort. Work is not getting done as well as it could be, and there\u2019s now a fair amount of sophisticated research showing problems with this. Productivity, innovation problems. The questio",

      "content_text": "The die was cast early for Wharton professor of business economics and public policy Olivia S. Mitchell to become an economist. Both her parents were economists, and her father\u2019s career as a diplomat brought her to several developing countries including Peru and Chile. Subliminal reinforcement came from the clock on the kitchen table with the words \u201cTime is money.\u201d That has guided her work over a career spanning more than four-and-a-half decades, especially in her role as executive director of Wharton\u2019s Pension Research Council . In a conversation with Wharton Dean Erika James, Mitchell discusses her career path, her research, and how we can make better decisions about retirement, among other topics.

Watch the video for the full conversation or read an edited version of the transcript below. Transcript Erika James: Olivia, welcome. I\u2019m so excited to talk with you about your research. But before we get into your research, I\u2019m very eager to learn about you, your background, and your journey to Wharton. Let us get to know you, the person before we get to dive into you, the professional. It\u2019s a great pleasure to be with you. Olivia S. Mitchell: Thank you, Erika, for all you do for the School and the world. I was doomed to become an economist. Both of my parents are economists, or were \u2013 they\u2019ve now passed \u2013 and over the kitchen table in our house, there was a clock which read, \u201cTime is money.\u201d So with that in my environment, what else could I do but become an economist? I went to high school in Lima, Peru, and in Santiago, Chile. My father was posted there as a diplomat. After that I taught kindergarten, [but] decided that wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. I went on to teach literacy to the slum dwellers that lived around Lima who didn\u2019t know how to read and therefore couldn\u2019t even take a bus because they didn\u2019t know what it said on the bus. When I went to college in the U.S., I continued working on development topics. I wrote a senior thesis on the difficulties and challenges of worker self-managed firms in Peru. Then I went on to graduate school where I decided to diversify a little bit and start to study public finance. My first job right out of school was teaching at Cornell University, where my department chair asked me to teach a course on pensions and health insurers. I was 25 years old. I had no clue. So I read the book quickly, and I thought this is an interesting topic. Then I came to Wharton, [which] hired [me] to continue studying pensions and issues of retirement security. And here I am. I\u2019ve never deviated from that path. Seeds of a Career in Retirement Security James: Did you always know that you were going to pursue a career in academia? Mitchell: No, I had no idea I was going to become an academic. I always had a five-year plan. So when I finished graduate school, I interviewed with the World Bank, the Foreign Service, and some other companies. I thought I\u2019ll give it five years in academia, and then another five. And here I am, 42 [years]. One year later, I\u2019ll still say, I\u2019ll give it another five. James: You\u2019ve been at Wharton for how long? Mitchell: Thirty years and it\u2019s been terrific. I was brought in to work on directing the Pension Research Council, but I\u2019ve also been teaching, I teach a course now, open to all undergraduates at Penn called Consumer Financial Decision Making. It\u2019s all about the kinds of things you need to know as an adult moving into the financial world. James: And you created that course. Mitchell: [Wharton finance professor] Nikolai Roussanov and I created it. It\u2019s always completely booked up. It\u2019s a ton of fun. And the students write to me later saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s great. Can you help me with my 401(k) choice?\u201d and things like that. James: Other than retirement planning, what are some of the other consumer choices that you discuss in the class? Mitchell: We talk about everything from student loans, whether you should take a lease or buy a car, credit card problems and whether you should pay only the minimum every month, which too many people do. Then we go through the life cycle. At some point you might think about trying to buy a house or an apartment. At some point, probably early, you should think about disability insurance, life insurance, starting a family, and all the things that have 529 plans tied to them. Then, of course, we need to think about saving for retirement from a very young age, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to wish that you had a little bit later. James: Let\u2019s dive into your research a little bit. I want to take it back to the beginning because your research, which spans decades and covers a variety of different topics in both finance and economics. What drew you to those topics? I know you said you were doomed to study [them], but what was it about that time, those fields, that resonated with you so much? Mitchell: I got involved back in 1992 with a great study called the Health and Retirement Survey. And this is a nationally representative study of people over the age of 50, financed by the National Institute on Aging. We surveyed 20,000 people every two years from when they enter until they pass away. We also have merged \u2013 with their permission \u2013 their Social Security earnings records, benefit records, Medicare records, and so forth. We can see what factors are driving their retirement saving, when they claim their benefits and what happens to them in later life. Along the way I decided to launch a short module on financial literacy trying to find out answers to very simple questions one on inflation, one on interest rates, and one on risk diversification. I was shocked to find out that fewer than half of the older American population, 50 and over, could answer all three questions right. If they can\u2019t do that, how are they going to decide if they\u2019ve saved enough or invested enough, or maybe they\u2019ll withdraw their money too quickly from their retirement pot later in life. That led to a big effort to try to enhance financial literacy. Our survey has now been delivered in over 150 countries. It\u2019s part of a high school test in Europe to examine students\u2019 financial literacy. It\u2019s just been a fascinating effort. That is so important, reflecting all of the things that I didn\u2019t know when I was coming of age and even into adulthood until it\u2019s almost too late to make good choices. Behavioral Economics and Retirement Planning James: Your research delves into the intersection of behavioral economics and retirement planning. Tell us more how you think about the concept of behavioral economics and what does that actually mean? Mitchell: Well, the whole behavioral area has [seen] enormous growth over the past 20 years. As it pertains particularly to the retirement age-plus population, I focused on the kinds of things that people don\u2019t know about their own future livelihoods. In one interesting example, a colleague from Microsoft Research showed people a picture of their current face and then with software age the face. There was a slider button at the bottom and as you slid the button to the right, you save more for retirement. The face at the right, your future self, became happier and happier. As you slid the slider to the left, the current face became very cheerful, and the guy on the right was morose. This is what people need to visualize their future selves. In fact, I\u2019ve recently been talking to people about trying to design an avatar to try to go through alternative retirement scenarios. That really is helpful, and it teaches us the kinds of behavioral obstacles people face when they try to visualize themselves in the future. Preparing for Longevity Risk James: So as I get closer and closer to retirement \u2014 Mitchell: We hope not. James: Not anytime soon, but every year I\u2019m closer and closer. Sometimes it can be daunting to think about all of the options and all the considerations. Because for most of us, it\u2019s not something that we were taught earlier in life. Do you find that as you\u2019re interacting with people of different demographic ages that they are either more or less receptive to learning and changing behaviors in a way that would prepare them for their future retirement? Mitchell: One of the things we\u2019ve been looking at recently is the concept of longevity risk. Not only do people have to have a sense of, on average, how long they\u2019ll live, but also, what\u2019s the tail of the distribution? What are the chances you\u2019ll survive to 85, 95, 105, and so forth? We see big differences, demographic differences. Interestingly enough, in the U. S., the Black population seems to think it will live longer than it will, given the objective survival table. Women tend to underestimate how long they will live. All those factors shape how much you save, whether you claim your Social Security benefits too early, and whether you spend your money too quickly and run out of money in later life. We\u2019ve been trying to come up with simple explanations. Did you realize that a male, say of age 65, has a 35% chance of living to age 90, and [that is] higher for women. That gets people to sit up and say, \u201cOh, number one, I regret I didn\u2019t save enough. Number two, I regret claiming my Social Security benefits too early. And number three, I wish I had bought long-term care insurance and an annuity. So there are ways that we\u2019re trying to bring these subjects to people in a way that makes it very concrete and very individual, and helps them make better financial decisions. Shaping Retirement Policies James: Your work has influenced policy decisions globally. Can you share particular instances where your research directly impacted retirement policies, either here or somewhere outside of the U.S., and how did it shape your notions for what to study going forward? Mitchell: I had the good fortune to work on President George W. Bush\u2019s Commission to Strengthen So",

Goal Improve your \u201cprompt engineering\u201d to generate the most insightful, relevant outputs from AI. Nano Tool Achieving valuable results from AI is as much about the quality of your prompts as the capabilities of the tool. You can be a more effective \u201chuman in the loop\u201d by refining your ability to formulate clear, specific, and context-rich queries, and obtain more useful solutions and actionable insights as a result. Action Steps Here are six key tactics \u2014 grounded in Wharton research \u2014 to help you create more effective AI prompts for business applications. 1. Specify the desired outcome. Clearly define what you want the AI to produce. Instead of a vague query like, \u201cWhat are the trends in my industry?\u201d try: \u201cList three emerging trends in the health care industry and explain how each could impact small health care providers.\u201d For more complex tasks, provide step-by-step instructions. Why: Research by Ethan Mollick emphasizes that specificity increases the likelihood of relevant, actionable results. Structured instructions help AI \u201cchain\u201d reasoning steps together more effectively. 2. Provide context and constraints. Give the AI background information and boundaries to operate within. For example, rather than \u201cCreate a marketing plan,\u201d try: \u201cDevelop a digital marketing strategy for a mid-sized e-commerce brand targeting eco-conscious consumers with a $50,000 budget.\u201d Add personas, style preferences, tone, or previous outputs the AI should reference. Be mindful of the \u201ccontext window\u201d (roughly 8,000 words in most tools), which determines how much prior input the AI can \u201cremember.\u201d Why: Kartik Hosanagar\u2019s work on algorithmic decision-making highlights the importance of designing input systems that reflect business goals and ethical boundaries. Context and constraints guide AI to produce more relevant and responsible output. 3. Iterate and refine. Start with a basic prompt, then adjust based on the output. For example, if the AI generates a business plan missing competitive dynamics, follow up with: \u201cExpand the competitive analysis section, focusing on regional players.\u201d Troubleshoot by rewording, breaking prompts into smaller parts, or emphasizing key details. Why: AI responses improve through interaction. As Mollick and others have shown, iteration allows you to steer the AI toward greater depth and accuracy over time. 4. Ask for diverse approaches. Instruct the AI to explore multiple strategies or perspectives. For example: \u201cSuggest three different ways to enter the Southeast Asian market \u2014 low cost, moderate investment, and high-investment options.\u201d Why: Stefano Puntoni\u2019s research on human-AI collaboration suggests that diverse outputs encourage creativity and improve decision-making by exposing users to alternatives they might not have considered. 5. Use role playing to surface tailored insights. Assign the AI a specific role to shape its response. For instance, \u201cAct as a CFO advising the CEO \u2014 what are the financial risks and rewards of this project?\u201d Why: Role-based prompting helps align responses with stakeholder priorities. This mirrors Hosanagar\u2019s findings on aligning AI behavior with the needs and expectations of different organizational roles. 6. Document and reuse high-performing prompts. Create a prompt library to capture the inputs that consistently yield useful results. Tag them by function (e.g., marketing, financial planning, hiring) for easy access. Why: Prasanna Tambe\u2019s work on workplace AI adoption shows that productivity gains often stem from standardizing successful practices \u2014 prompt templates included. How To Use It These examples demonstrate how to evolve a basic query into a more useful AI interaction. Prompt 1 : \u201cSuggest a marketing strategy.\u201d Prompt 2 (refined) : \u201cYou are a digital marketing expert. Suggest a digital marketing strategy for a $1M-revenue SaaS company targeting small-to-mid-sized businesses in the U.S., focusing on cost-effective channels for customer acquisition.\u201d Prompt 1: \u201cWhat are some strategies for entering the European market?\u201d Prompt 2 (refined): \u201cSuggest three market entry strategies for a mid-sized U.S.-based software company specializing in cybersecurity solutions targeting financial institutions in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Focus on cost-effective approaches, regulatory considerations, and partnership opportunities.\u201d Prompt 1: \u201cHow can I improve customer retention?\u201d Prompt 2 (refined): \u201cProvide five customer retention strategies for an online retail business with a subscription-based model, focusing on reducing churn among customers aged 25-40. Highlight low-cost, personalized approaches, and best practices in customer engagement.\u201d Contributors to This Nano Tool This Nano Tool draws on cutting-edge research and thought leadership from Wharton faculty who are shaping the global conversation on AI in business.

      "content_text": "The following article was originally published by AI at Wharton . Generative artificial intelligence has a quantity-over-quality problem. One of the biggest challenges in using large language models like ChatGPT is precision. \u201cWhy do you need to buy the whole candy store if you just need a lollipop,\u201d said Daniel Ringel , marketing professor at the University of Chapel Hill\u2019s Kenan-Flagler Business School. His latest study looks at how synthetic experts can refine results to give users exactly what they need. He created one for the study and compared it with the work of crowdsourcing amateurs, academic experts, and ChatGPT-4. The synthetic expert outdid them all, performing 66 times faster and 400 times cheaper than ChatGPT-4. Ringel was one of four scholars who shared their work during the webinar, \u201cAI and Innovation,\u201d that streamed live on March 1. The webinar series is hosted by AI at Wharton . Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, and co-director of AI at Wharton Kartik Hosanagar served as moderator. \u201cClearly, AI is going to significantly transform work, the productivity of organizations, even how things work at the macroeconomic and societal level,\u201d he said. The webinar also featured research presentations from Dokyun Lee , information systems professor at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business; Rayna Xu , information systems and analytics professor at Miami University\u2019s Farmer School of Business; and L\u00e9onard Boussioux , information systems and operations management professor at the University of Washington\u2019s Foster School of Business. Boussioux hailed AI\u2019s ability to help humans solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems \u2014 including the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations \u2014 if they can filter out the noise. In his co-authored paper on gen AI and crowdsourcing, he found humans and machines were equal in creating ideas for the circular economy. But humans were better at highly novel solutions, so the most valuable ideas came from a collaboration of both. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for AI to recombine ideas, but it\u2019s harder to get moonshots.\u201d \u2014 L\u00e9onard Boussioux \u201cThis whole study is motivated by the statistical view of innovation. The best ideas are statistically rare,\u201d Boussioux said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for AI to recombine ideas, but it\u2019s harder to get moonshots.\u201d Xu\u2019s co-authored paper looked at another aspect of AI\u2019s quantity-over-quality problem by examining whether Google or ChatGPT was better at information retrieval. The study found ChatGPT excelled at pulling answers to questions but struggled with fact-checking. Depending on the task, integrating AI into traditional search engines may generate the most stable results, she said. Xu pointed out ChatGPT\u2019s accuracy is improving, with each iteration getting better at fact-checking. Lee\u2019s co-authored study introduced InnoVAET, an exploratory tool that enables interpretation, comparison, visualization, and augmented creation of multi-modal business objects. He said the tool can help business leaders understand the competitive landscape and filter good ideas for strategic action. \u201cNovelty is the easy part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenging part is how do you make sure that things are valuable.\u201d",

      "content_text": "Wharton management professor Ethan Mollick understands that it\u2019s tempting to treat generative AI as if it were a real person. It\u2019s been trained on the entirety of human knowledge and can respond with precise answers to specific questions. AI has even been shown to respond to people in crisis with more empathy than some doctors and therapists, he said. \u201cThe best way to work with it is to treat it like a person, so you\u2019re in this interesting trap,\u201d said Mollick, co-director of the Generative AI Lab at Wharton. \u201cTreat it like a person and you\u2019re 90% of the way there. At the same time, you have to remember you are dealing with a software process.\u201d This anthropomorphism of AI often ends in a doomsday scenario, where people envision a robot uprising. Mollick thinks the probability of computers becoming sentient is small, but there are \u201cenough serious people worried about it\u201d that he includes it among the four scenarios sketched out in his new book, Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI . \u201cThe best way to work with [AI] is to treat it like a person, so you\u2019re in this interesting trap.\u201d \u2014 Ethan Mollick An existential threat is unlikely, and so is the scenario that AI remains where it is now, stuck in a somewhat useful but clunky stage. Mollick wants his readers to focus on what he considers to be the two most likely scenarios in the middle: AI will continue to have either exponential or linear growth. And he wants everyone to get on board with exploring how AI can enhance their productivity and improve their lives. \u201cOne of the main mistakes people make with AI is assuming that because it\u2019s a technology product, it should only be used by technical people, and that just isn\u2019t the case,\u201d he said. \u201cMy argument has always been to use it for everything, and that\u2019s how you figure what it\u2019s good or bad at.\u201d Mollick spoke with Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni about his book during a webinar for the AI Horizons series. The series is hosted by AI at Wharton to showcase emerging knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. Puntoni, who has also conducted extensive research into AI and its applications, asked Mollick to address concerns ranging from human replacement to regulatory frameworks. AI and Entrepreneurship In addition to being an academic, Mollick is also an entrepreneur who co-founded a startup and advises a number of startups. He said AI is a \u201cno-brainer solution\u201d for many problems faced by founders who are too cash-poor to hire extra help. Need a lawyer to review a contract? AI can help. Need a marketer to build a website or a coder for technical advice? AI can help. Need to write a grant application, a press release, or social media chatter? AI is the answer. \u201cThe thing about entrepreneurs is you have to be a jack of all trades. You have to do many things, and entrepreneurs often get tripped up because of one or two of those things they can\u2019t do,\u201d Mollick said. \u201cMy argument has always been to use it for everything, and that\u2019s how you figure what it\u2019s good or bad at.\u201d \u2014 Ethan Mollick The Responsibility of Tech Companies Mollick communicates regularly with industry leaders and said the major AI producers take their security responsibilities seriously. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a fig leaf. They do seem to care when I talk to them,\u201d he said. Everyone agrees that regulation is necessary, but figuring out the details is difficult. Mollick said high-powered, open-source models can be easily stripped of their controls \u201cwith just a little bit of work\u201d on the back end, which scammers can manipulate. On the front end, too much preemptive regulation could stifle experimentation and progress. Instead, Mollick advocates for \u201cfast regulations\u201d that can be enacted as problems arise. \u201cAs harms emerge, we need to take action against those harms. But we also need to make sure that we are not getting in the way of potential good uses, because some of the bad uses are baked in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you want is regulators watching very closely and reacting, and we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d",

      "content_text": "The following article was originally published by AI at Wharton . When deployed correctly, generative artificial intelligence can help employees become more innovative, free them from mundane tasks, and improve their communication skills. That\u2019s the message from three scholars who shared their research during the \u201cAI Horizons\u201d webinar, \u201cAI and the Workforce\u201d which streamed live on February 16. The webinar series is hosted by AI at Wharton to showcase emerging knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. Each panelist presented research on a distinct aspect of labor, yet the overarching theme was clear: Rather than fearing AI as a threat to human capital, it can help employees bring their best selves to work. For example, allowing AI to perform repetitive banal tasks boosts employee morale. A co-authored study by Xueming Luo , marketing professor at Temple University\u2019s Fox School of Business, found that when chatbots and voice-assisted AI handled low-level customer service calls at a telemarketing company, the employees showed greater commitment and ingenuity with callers who had complex requests. \u201cThey have a stronger interest and motivation. They feel much better, even their pride is higher. They have more energy because they have more mental power to think about creative solutions,\u201d Luo said. The study also found that highly-skilled workers feel more positively about AI because it can help them achieve more, whereas lower-skilled workers feel more negatively about being limited by AI-enabled scripts. Luo said that difference is a\u00a0key takeaway: employers need to communicate clearly to employees the intended use for AI. \u201cLower-skilled workers always feel threatened that the company is rolling out technology that is going to lay them off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company should indicate that the technology can be used to help [employees perform better].\u201d A co-authored study from Cedric Xingchen Xu , doctoral researcher at the University of Washington\u2019s Foster School of Business, showed how the release of ChatGPT prompted a significant decline in the number of freelance jobs posted in an online marketplace. With competition intensifying,\u00a0freelancers who are incorporating large language models (LLMs) into their services are reaping the benefits. \u201cInstead of viewing AI as a threat to human capital, employers, employees, and gig workers should consider leveraging AI to excel at work.\u201d \u2014 Mary Purk \u201cThey are getting more transactions over time compared with other people, so there\u2019s clearly opportunity,\u201d Xu said. In the paper, the co-authors recommended that gig platforms and policymakers provide resources to help freelancers adapt and thrive in the changing market. Some job applicants are writing better resum\u00e9s with the help of LLMs. A co-authored research study from Emma Wiles , doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that candidates who utilized \u201calgorithmic writing help\u201d on their resum\u00e9s were hired 8% more often than those who did not. Wiles said the curve will flatten as more and more job-seekers use such tools to polish their resumes, and\u00a0interviews will become more critical to the hiring process in the future. \u201cAs AI-enhanced or generated writing materials become more common, writing is likely to become an even less reliable signal of job performance,\u201d she said. Mary Purk, executive director of AI at Wharton and moderator of the discussion, said the research presented by the scholars demonstrates the deep impact AI will have on hiring, retention, productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction. \u201cAdmittedly, AI is a disruptor in the marketplace. But instead of viewing AI as a threat to human capital, employers, employees, and gig workers should consider leveraging AI to excel at work. By delegating repetitive, boring tasks to AI, we can increase morale and energy and allow individuals to focus on tasks that truly showcase their capabilities.\u201d",

      "content_text": "Behavioral scientist David De Cremer didn\u2019t have to look far to find inspiration for his most recent book , The AI-Savvy Leader: Nine Ways to Take Back Control and Make AI Work . As a teaching professor, researcher, and consultant to businesses worldwide, he\u2019s seeing firsthand the apprehension among business leaders racing to make generative artificial intelligence part of their operations. They\u2019re under enormous pressure to integrate gen AI to drive efficiency, crush competition, and make more money. \u201cThe \u2018why\u2019 of my book is because I see that people are struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking our business leaders to bring in a technology they actually don\u2019t understand, but we ask them at the same time to adapt to it. It\u2019s an extremely difficult balancing act.\u201d De Cremer, who is dean of Northeastern University\u2019s D\u2019Amore-McKim School of Business, talked about his book during a webinar for the AI Horizons series, which was created by AI at Wharton to showcase emerging knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. The webinar was hosted by Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni , who is a longtime colleague and friend of De Cremer. Why AI Is the Next Great Leadership Challenge De Cremer doesn\u2019t deny the transformative power of AI, saying that it is all the things hyped by tech gurus \u2014 a game changer, a value creator, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But it\u2019s also the next great leadership challenge. He advises executives to think of AI as their ultimate change management project. \u201cPeter Drucker said once the best way to predict the future is to create it, and I think this really applies today to the role that business leaders can play in the process of AI adoption,\u201d he said. The first task, he said, is to align AI comprehension with organizational purpose. In other words, figure out how AI can serve the specific needs of business and its stakeholders. Don\u2019t just implement AI out of FOMO or \u201cfear of missing out.\u201d \u201cLeaders also need to be visionary, because they need to make AI meaningful,\u201d he said. \u201cAI needs to become part of your vision and your mission, so people understand why why it is that this new coworker is brought in.\u201d De Cremer offered a few more tidbits from the book: Leaders should maintain a \u201chumans-first, AI second\u201d outlook by thinking about the ways AI can elevate their employees, not simply replace them. The savvy AI leader needs to be an excellent communicator who can bring together tech and business experts. The leader also needs to flatten communication hierarchies and open up silos around AI. It\u2019s an iterative process, so everyone must be able to exchange information about what works and what doesn\u2019t in order to perfect it. Traditional leadership skills are still needed. \u201cI think the biggest insight here is that leadership behaviors that have been successful in the past are also going to be successful today, but in a different relationship,\u201d De Cremer said. Puntoni, who also approaches AI from a behavioral context, agreed with De Cremer\u2019s points. He raises similar ones in his own book, Decision-driven Analytics . \u201cThe conversation about leadership is too often missing from the discussions around AI, and I think that is really very much to the detriment of organizations,\u201d Puntoni said. \u201cEven if you take a tech focus, I think it is crucial to realize that it is not going to work until it is functional to the vision and objective of the company.\u201d",

      "content_text": "Professor Itay Goldstein is joined by Tobias Adrian, financial counselor and director of the International Monetary Fund, to explore the regulatory challenges posed by the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in finance. The conversation delves into the emerging risks AI introduces to the financial sector, the steps regulatory bodies are taking to mitigate these risks, and the balance between innovation and stability in global financial markets. This discussion is part of a special series called \u201cFuture of Finance.\u201d Watch the video or read the edited transcript below. Listen to a podcast of the conversation here (also on Spotify and Apple Podcasts ). Transcript Itay Goldstein: The topic that we are going to dive into today is AI in finance. AI is promising to change the way that the financial industry works in many different ways. There are many opportunities, many risks, and regulatory concerns. We will talk about all this with Tobias Adrian , financial counselor and director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the International Monetary Fund. I look forward to hearing your insights, Tobias. Your division at the IMF has written a report about the use of AI in finance. Can you tell us a little more about what is at stake? What are the opportunities? What are the risks? What issues do you see? Tobias Adrian: Our Global Financial Stability Report has a special focus on artificial intelligence or AI in finance. There are different modes of AI. Some AI techniques have been deployed in finance for many decades, and have reshaped the way that finance worked already. Here, I\u2019m particularly thinking about algorithmic trading, which is primarily based on machine learning techniques. When we\u2019re looking at liquid capital markets today, we already see a tremendous impact of artificial intelligence on how those markets are working. [That relates to] trading activity in equity markets in the U.S. and other advanced economies, or treasury markets. The most liquid securities in those markets are already largely traded in an algorithmic fashion based on artificial intelligence; [they trade] at very high frequencies. What is new in recent years is, of course, the arrival of generative artificial intelligence. That is quite different from the machine learning that has been previously deployed. So, the focus of our report is on understanding to what extent generative AI, including the large language models, could impact the financial industry. Our particular focus is on trading, or on capital markets activity. There are also other areas of finance that are already being impacted. Challenges in Using Gen AI in the Financial Sector Goldstein: One of the things that we think about when we think about AI is the agency \u2013 that now AI will be a decision-maker, and will start doing things on its own. I wonder if some of this is also reflected in the way you\u2019re thinking about it and in your report. Adrian: Yes, absolutely. It is certainly true that in algorithmic trading, you do see a lot of automated decision-making at very high frequencies. There could be thousands of millions of decisions that are that are fully automated. [Understanding] to what extent that will be changed or influenced by generative AI is still work-in-progress. Let me dig a little bit deeper into what generative AI is, and how it is being used already and how it may be used going forward. Generative AI uses very large models that are calibrated to very large data in order to elicit answers that are somewhat similar to the way that human intelligence works. That is why the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is used. In the large language models, the interaction is via natural language. The logic is quite different from [that with] traditional programming, where you write code, and then the computer generates output. [With Gen AI], you have a model that has been calibrated, and then you use information from that model to generate output. The challenge here is two-fold. Number one, we don\u2019t fully understand how these models really work. They are extremely powerful, but they\u2019re a little bit of a black box at the moment. So, a lot of research today is discovering what kind of knowledge is embedded in the generative AI models. We are still learning about the technology that is very powerful, but that\u2019s still very recent. As a result, the financial sector is still in the process of understanding how [it could use] those models across [its activities], and for trading activity in particular. One policy concern is the lack of explainability and the unpredictability to some degree. Highly complex information is used in a way that may be working similar to the human brain. But we don\u2019t fully understand how it performs in terms of trading, for example, when new situations are feeding into financial market activity. There\u2019s a certain amount of unpredictability and lack of explainability. [Understanding] the impact of that is a work-in-progress. Big Opportunities for Efficiencies, and New Risks Our sense is that there are tremendous opportunities. We already see some areas where we think the new technology has a first-order impact. For example, when complex reports are being published \u2014 say, an SEC filing of a publicly-traded company. These can be very thick, 100-page-long reports. A generative AI model can very quickly extract information from [such a] report. Another example is statements by monetary policy-makers like the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve. When they publish their policy decision that comes alongside their statement, [that] statement now can be analyzed very quickly by generative AI \u2013 and so, the informational efficiency of markets can be increased, in principle. We see some evidence that that may be the case. It could be very good for market efficiency. But then there are other areas where we don\u2019t know exactly how much efficiency would be improved and what the potential pitfalls could be. So, there are efficiency gains, but there are also new risks that we have to take into account. Goldstein: How widely used is it, at this point? Adrian: Our understanding is that every financial firm is exploring it, and there are many startups that are being built around the technology. In some areas, we do see traction. For example, we hear [that Gen AI is being used] to do compliance checks or credit risk analysis \u2013 where complex data, some of it from the public domain like the internet, and some from reports such as credit reports \u2013 have to be combined, and activity has to be detected. For example, for payments activity, financial institutions put a lot of effort into understanding whether a certain payment may be legitimate or illegitimate. We understand that in those areas, newer AI models can be very effective and the detection rate for fraudulent activity can increase tremendously. Our understanding is that there is already deployment [in those areas] that is very beneficial. We think trading as a capital market activity is more of an emerging area. It is not clear to us that it\u2019s very widely used at the moment, say, for high-frequency trading. What we have heard is that to venture into new potential trading activities, generative AI can be very good because it can generate, say, new trading strategies very quickly. It understands the potential trading strategies, and it can give you trading ideas. Then you can work with those ideas. You can literally generate code, but, we don\u2019t fully know to what extent that is being used,. What we\u2019re hearing from market intelligence is that it\u2019s helpful, but how it\u2019s being used is still somewhat a work-in-progress. When you think about a risk manager in a financial firm, you would certainly have some concerns about accountability and decision-making accuracy, right? In traditional automated trading, you can go through the code, and you understand how the code works. In generative AI, you can\u2019t trace back the code to decisions [that] are being taken. [However], if the model generates code, then that you can check. So, it is a bit of a complex undertaking. The lack of explainability, the magnitude of unpredictability and this lack of accountability in decision-making are certainly issues. Let me flag two more things. There is some literature documenting some bias that\u2019s not necessarily related to financial activity. But we don\u2019t know whether the time series properties of what is coming out of the model has good econometric properties from a trading perspective. So, when you think about trading strategies or capital market-making, you want to make sure that your strategy is resilient relative to extreme events in the future and to structural changes. We don\u2019t fully understand to what extent the [quality] of the data to which the model is calibrated is a good predictor for future performance. Another issue for financial firms that we heard [of] is that the technology firms ultimately develop and operate the large models; the financial firms are users of the models. But it\u2019s not [as if] they can possibly use variants of the model or calibrate the model to specific data. There\u2019s a certain amount of reliance on outside parties developing models that are not specifically generated for the financial industry. Third party service providers that may not have the same challenges in mind when generating models which a financial firm or trading firm would have. That generates a whole new set of issues in terms of third party dependency, which the financial industry is trying to tackle. A Black Box, with Risks of the Unknown Goldstein: So, you\u2019re saying there is potential here for better information processing that will contribute to market efficiency, and this is something we all want. On the negative side, or on the risk side, I hear you saying mostly that it\u2019s hard to explain what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a black box. It is delegated to other parties, and we don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re going to do with it. So it",

      "content_text": "The versatility of AI applications and their rapidly expanding user base have focused the spotlight on regulators and the need to provide guardrails for the technology. Wharton experts delved into that and related topics in a recent session of a new Wharton series called \u201c Policies That Work .\u201d Stefano Puntoni , Wharton marketing professor and co-director of AI at Wharton , moderated the panel on \u201cAI, Technology, and the Role of Regulation\u201d with Kartik Hosanagar , Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, and Kevin Werbach , Wharton professor of legal studies and business ethics and department chair. Watch the full panel or read some key takeaways below: Major Concerns for Policymakers Werbach put the major concerns with AI into three buckets: safety, governance, and abuses. On safety, advanced AI models, especially foundation models for generative AI, could cause catastrophic harm. While the potential for them to become \u201csuper intelligent and a threat to humanity\u201d is remote, he said, \u201cthere are certainly possibilities we could see mass casualties and attacks on critical infrastructure \u2014 really severe harms.\u201d Accuracy, bias, privacy, intellectual property, and transparency are other major concerns. The prevalence of bias is worrisome, for instance, when AI is used for sensitive decisions like hiring or lending, and there are challenges to transparency in that decision-making. Governance would also have to address issues such as data privacy and concentration of market power. Abuses could take the form of deliberate misuse of AI systems, such as misinformation, deepfakes, and cybersecurity abuses. Deepfakes and Biometrics: Two Urgent Issues Hosanagar picked deepfakes as the biggest issue that warrants regulatory attention. \u201cDeepfakes can create civil unrest, and democracies should be worried about it.\u201d Cybercrimes, especially in financial fraud, and pornography are other scenarios for deepfakes. According to Werbach, \u201cThe biggest gaps [are in areas where] we don\u2019t have any structure that\u2019s addressing serious problems.\u201d Generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, Character.ai, and other general-purpose large language models (LLMs) \u201ccan be incredibly valuable and useful, but also potentially dangerous.\u201d He pointed to cases where active users have committed suicide . Before detailed regulation, he recommended \u201cappropriate guardrails.\u201d Another area that lacks a regulatory structure is biometrics, especially facial recognition, which has been used for flight safety or to identify shoplifters. Evidence has shown that these biometric systems \u201ccan be highly inaccurate and highly biased,\u201d such as against darker-skinned people, if firms don\u2019t take care to mitigate those problems, Werbach said. He pointed to a recent case involving drug store chain Rite Aid , whose facial recognition tool to prevent shoplifting came under the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cDeep fakes can create civil unrest, and democracies should be worried about it.\u201d \u2014 Kartik Hosanagar Finding the Balance in Regulation AI regulation must strike the right balance which addresses \u201clegitimate concerns about equity, welfare, and safety, [without] stifling innovation,\u201d Puntoni said. \u201cThe risk is if you over-regulate, then you stifle innovation,\u201d Hosanagar said, noting that \u201cthe center of innovation\u201d shifts away from states or countries that regulate heavily. Hosanagar identified two approaches for AI regulation. One is that it should be issue-specific, instead of a broad-based approach that will bring \u201ccompliance headaches \u2026 to hundreds of other use cases that are harmless.\u201d For instance, such regulation could focus sharply on, say, deepfakes and financial fraud, instead of broader fields such as LLMs or image models in general, he said. The second approach is to create regulatory sandboxes for innovation. These sandboxes allow companies to try out their innovations, and for companies and regulators to track the relevant data, Hosanagar said. He cited the Monetary Authority of Singapore , which has a regulatory sandbox for financial use cases of AI; and Dubai , which covers emerging technologies. AI Regulation in the U.S. \u201cNo country in the world is really seriously trying to regulate all AI,\u201d Werbach said. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on use cases, or they\u2019re focused on risk.\u201d The U.S. does not have a specific federal law focused on AI regulation, but existing laws cover many potential concerns, such as unfair and deceptive practices, or discrimination. Some recent initiatives do address AI governance issues. The Biden administration in October 2023 issued an executive order on \u201cthe safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use\u201d of AI, which set out detailed requirements for government agencies to better understand the issues with the technology, and put in place procedures for investigations. The executive order is not binding on the private sector, but it will have an indirect effect, Werbach said. \u201cThe U.S. government is the biggest purchaser of everything, including AI technologies.\u201d Potential Changes Under Trump The U.S. is poised to shift gears on AI regulation from a focus on risk management under the Biden administration to efforts to \u201cunshackle AI\u201d in the coming Trump administration, Werbach continued. Trump\u2019s donors and campaign participants, including Elon Musk, \u201cthink the potential is there for this technology to be many orders of magnitude better, more powerful, and more valuable for the economy and for America. And they think regulation is standing in the way.\u201d That said, the future course of AI regulation in the U.S. is less clear, as the Trump campaign has targeted big tech but has also spoken of unshackling companies from regulation. \u201cNo country in the world is really seriously trying to regulate all AI. They\u2019re focused on use cases, or they\u2019re focused on risk.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Werbach AI developers are not, however, waiting for clarity. \u201cCompanies are voluntarily doing AI governance, and engaging in these standards processes, because they want the AI to be trusted,\u201d Werbach said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have a situation where they build something and it\u2019s discriminatory, or one of their users commits suicide.\u201d While it is premature to speculate on the shape of federal AI laws under the Trump administration, state-level AI regulation is moving forward. Some 700 AI bills are pending in U.S. states, and dozens have been adopted, including in California and Colorado, Werbach said. One high-profile bill in California (SB 1047) was recently vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Regulation in Other Countries Singapore, the U.K., the European Union, and China have taken concrete steps to regulate AI. Singapore, for instance, released a Model AI Governance Framework earlier this year, which Hosanagar characterized as business friendly. The EU earlier this year passed its AI Act , which Werbach described as \u201ccomprehensive, top-down, detailed, and prescriptive.\u201d It has a risk-based approach, where it identifies \u201chigh risk\u201d uses of AI such as in hiring, defense, criminal justice, finance, and education. The EU is currently in \u201ca process of standardization and engagement\u201d with its AI Act. China has adopted at least three enforceable laws already on AI, which are focused on recommender systems, deepfakes, and generative AI systems. China also requires approval and licensing to deploy chatbots with public-facing LLMs, preceded by a standardized and structured test. Confronting Bias In framing regulations to prevent bias in AI systems, policymakers must recognize that they confront issues that may be rooted in either technical, ethical, legal, or governance shortcomings. Hosanagar said bias in AI models may originate from training data; that could be mitigated by bias detection tools, or data resampling, or fixing data gaps. For instance, data is sparse for minority groups, and technical solutions for that could include data resampling or using fairness-aware machine learning approaches, he added. Shortcomings in algorithms used for hiring or credit scorings could take on a legal dimension if they invoke anti-discrimination laws. Bias is also an ethical issue, and it raises fundamental questions such as how to define fairness, or who gets to define it. \u201cThe difficulty is when you deploy algorithms into social systems, and you have bias emerging as an interplay between algorithmic and human decision-making,\u201d said Puntoni. Bias can be a tricky issue to regulate. \u201cHuman decision-makers are incredibly biased, and they can hide their biases behind explanations that seem to make sense,\u201d said Hosanagar. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to hide AI biases. [But] the problem with AI biases is that they scale. A biased judge in a courtroom affects a few thousand lives. If you use an AI system to guide a judge\u2019s sentencing decisions, and it is biased, it affects millions of lives.\u201d \u201cThe difficulty is when you deploy algorithms into social systems, and you have bias emerging as an interplay between algorithmic and human decision-making.\u201d \u2014 Stefano Puntoni Bias cannot be regulated away with just blanket rules. Instead, Werbach recommended toolkits for technical, ethical, and governance issues along with the evolution of standards and best practices. Other ways to resolve accuracy issues are to have governance frameworks that incorporate explainability and human-in-the-loop requirements. For instance, if an AI system rejects a loan application, it could come with an explanation. In other settings where AI cannot be fully autonomous, human intervention could fix accuracy problems. Accuracy is also \u201ca huge challenge,\u201d especially when generative AI systems create hallucinations or confabulations with generative AI, Werbach said. He advised against laying down regulatory thresholds arbitrarily, noting that generative AI systems \u201cdon\u2019t understand in any kind of human way how they relate to the real world.\u201d But Werbach made an exception for AI safety: \u201cIf we are worried about catastrophic ",

      "content_text": "Owning a home has been an integral part of realizing the American Dream, but a combination of forces is thwarting that goal for many. The key conspirators: relentlessly high housing prices ; high mortgage rates that rise along with interest rates but don\u2019t fall in tandem; a mortgage lock-in phenomenon that restricts the supply of homes available for sale and thus pushes up home prices; tight zoning laws; and higher construction costs. Efforts are being made to ease the supply constraints, but the biggest benefits will come from taming inflation. Wharton experts delved into those issues at an event titled \u201c Real Estate, Interest Rates, and the Shifting American Dream \u201d on December 4, 2024. The panel included Joseph Gyourko , Wharton professor of real estate, finance, and business economics and public policy, and Susan M. Wachter , Wharton professor of real estate and finance, and co-director of the Penn Institute for Urban Research. Wharton real estate professor Maisy Wong moderated the event. It was the third event in a new Wharton series called \u201c Policies That Work .\u201d Watch the full panel or read some key takeaways below: Why Haven\u2019t Mortgage Rates Dropped? Mortgage rates reflect the premia that lenders and investors want to cover the risks they face, including the inflation rate and inflation expectations, interest-rate volatility, and a prepayment rush if interest rates decline. The Federal Reserve in August 2024 began reducing the short-term Fed funds rate , with the latest cut putting that in the 4.5% to 4.75% range, but the 30-year mortgage rate has stayed at about 7%. The Fed funds rate reflects the overnight rate at which banks lend to each other to meet reserve requirements. \u201cWhether the Fed cut short-term rates or not \u2026 you should be expecting 6% to 7% mortgage rates for a while,\u201d said Gyourko. Mortgage rates don\u2019t move in tandem with the Fed funds rate because they follow a different math. Investors who bring the money for mortgages use as a reference point the 10-year Treasury bond rate , which is now at 4.28% and already factors in risks associated with inflation and productivity growth. But they have to be compensated for the additional risks brought on by the longer tenure of a 30-year mortgage. Those risks go in both directions: One is the risk of a higher inflation rate, where borrowers hold on to lower mortgage rates and don\u2019t refinance, which is called the mortgage lock-in effect . \u201cWhether the Fed cut short term rates or not \u2026 you should be expecting 6% to 7% mortgage rates for a while.\u201d \u2014 Joseph Gyourko \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen in the crisis that we\u2019re in right now,\u201d said Wachter. \u201cEveryone is holding on to their 4%, 5%, 3% mortgage, decreasing supply, but the hoped-for decline in rates which will ease supply increases the risk to the investor, due to prepayments, and this is keeping the mortgage rate premia over the 10-year [Treasury] at a high.\u201d If interest rates fall, that is not good news for those investors, because it will bring a prepayment risk: Borrowers will refinance their homes at the new low rates, and repay their older and more expensive mortgages. \u201cSo, in a volatile environment, we\u2019re stuck with 6% to 7% [mortgage] rates for now and in the coming months, despite the fact that the Fed has decreased [the funds rate] by 25 basis points,\u201d Wachter said. How High Mortgage Rates Are Causing a Housing Scarcity Higher mortgage rates are causing a housing scarcity, Wachter noted. With the mortgage lock-in effect, people are staying put in their homes. That has reduced the supply of homes for sale, which in turn has raised home prices. The reduction in mobility from the lock-in effect is large, with Gyourko putting that drop at between a quarter and third. Gyourko noted that 80% to 90% of all homes sales each year are from the existing stock, so a 30% drop in the share of existing owners who move each year implies that over one-quarter of the homes listed for sale are not available now. Newly built homes have rushed to fill that gap, and their supply as a share of total purchases has increased substantially to an all-time high, Wachter said. But such new construction isn\u2019t sufficient to significantly ease the housing supply crunch. What makes that worse in some supply-constrained coastal markets such as Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles is a near freeze on new housing construction, thanks to strict zoning and permitting rules. In housing markets with easier permitting, new construction is increasing densification, and those homes \u2014 which may include multi-story apartments and townhouses \u2014 are costlier to build. Housing demand now runs high, and supply is tight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tailwind from our demography; the millenniums are at their peak homeownership years, and they\u2019re buying,\u201d Wachter said. But she expected that trend to change over the next decade with the pent-up demand exhausted. In early signs of that coming change, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing demand for higher education dropping now \u2026 and going forward, we\u2019re going to see this translate into a decline in demand for starter homes, but that is in the long-term and not relevant for this generation of first-time homebuyers,\u201d she predicted. \u201c[The] hoped-for decline in rates which will ease supply increases the risk to the investor, due to prepayments, and this is keeping the mortgage rate premia over the 10-year [Treasury] at a high.\u201d \u2014 Susan M. Wachter Tackling the Affordability Challenge Gyourko cited estimates by an engineering consulting firm called RSMeans that an entry-level, 1,800-square-foot home in the Atlanta suburbs cost $250,000 to build in 2020, including land and the developer\u2019s profit; that same home cost $302,000 in 2023 \u2014 a 21% increase, without adjusting for inflation. Most of that increase was because \u201clabor costs shot through the roof,\u201d and not so much because of land and material costs, he explained. Wachter pointed out that while that RSMeans estimate is the average cost, developers today are maxing out production and charging at the marginal cost price, which is higher than the average cost. \u201cThe equivalent new home today, compared to 2019, is 50% more expensive,\u201d she said. In an effort to meet the market need, developers are building more affordable homes by reducing the sizes of the homes and scaling down on the finishes. \u201cFor the first time, the price of a new home is not at a premium to existing homes, which tells us that the construction firms are building to the market,\u201d Wachter said. Homebuilders are cutting the size of homes and using smaller lots. In addition, recently, margins have been coming down, as builders face buyer price resistance. \u201cWe are at a 40-year low in measures of affordability, which is why the young generation is having difficulty in becoming homeowners.\u201d \u201cWe used to be quite affordable,\u201d Wachter said, recalling that the average ratio between income and the price of a home in the U.S. used to be around 3:1, where a household with $30,000 in annual income could afford a $100,000 home. But that ratio has gone up to levels of 5:1 and higher, especially \u201cin markets where the jobs are,\u201d she said. Even so, the U.S. is more affordable than most of the rest of the world, especially in China\u2019s tier one cities, Singapore and South Korea, where that ratio can be 10:1 or more. Alternatives to Increasing Housing Supply \u201cWe always think supply is one way that can help us improve affordability,\u201d Wong said. While tough zoning laws, mortgage lock-ins, and densification cramp the housing supply, some alternatives are emerging. One is big-name developers offering single-family rentals as an option to owning a home; it is noteworthy that institutional owners such as Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent have entered a market segment that has traditionally been a mom-and-pop activity, Gyourko said. \u201cPeople may want to live where opportunity is. That\u2019s also a part of the American Dream. And renting can give you access to opportunity.\u201d \u2014 Maisy Wong Single-family rentals are also a viable option for young families with kids that want to be in a single-family home in a good school district, but don\u2019t have the financial means to buy one. \u201cOwning a home is historically something we connect with as the American Dream,\u201d said Wong. \u201cBut people may want to live where opportunity is. That\u2019s also a part of the American Dream. And renting can give you access to opportunity.\u201d Many states are experimenting with solutions to increasing housing supply. One is to permit homeowners to build what are called \u201caccessory dwelling units\u201d in their backyards. California, New York, and Washington are among the states that allow such construction. \u201cThis is another way of becoming a homeowner and getting some cash from renting,\u201d Wachter said. In another move to ease supply constraints, some states have also begun to restrict the ability of localities to have tight zoning laws, Gyourko said. But such solutions to increasing housing supply will need active government intervention with political support; market forces alone will not solve the problem, he stressed. \u201cIn the United States, there\u2019s not an informal housing sector. So, permits are where this stuff starts,\u201d he added. Construction technology is also chipping in: Companies like Greystar are moving into modular construction of apartment buildings, which brings benefits such as increased productivity, reduced waste, and faster time-to-market. Wachter listed inflation control as the topmost pre-requisite to easing higher mortgage payments along with reducing constraints on housing supply. \u201c[It is] very painful to get inflation down, but getting inflation down and getting inflation expectations down is a necessary part of the solution,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce we have longer-term expectations of inflation resolved back to the 2% level, then we\u2019ll have not just 10-year rates, but also the mortgage rate will drop as interest rate volatility will decline, and we\u2019ll have a freeing of the sup",

      "content_text": "Professor Itay Goldstein welcomes Alesia Haas, CFO of Coinbase, and Michelle Lai, board member of Electric Coin Co., to discuss the ongoing fintech revolution. They examine the transformative role of technology in finance, from blockchain innovations to the future of digital currencies, and provide insights into how FinTech is set to evolve in the coming years. This discussion is part of a special series called \u201cFuture of Finance.\u201d Watch the video or read the edited transcript below. Listen to a podcast of the conversation here (also on Spotify and Apple Podcasts ). Transcript Itay Goldstein: This is the Future of Finance podcast, Future of Finance mini series here at Wharton Sirius XM. I am Itay Goldstein. I am a professor at the Finance Department and the Chair of the Finance Department at Wharton. Today, we will talk about the Future of Fintech. Throughout the history of finance, technology has always played a central role. We saw many technological advancements, starting from ATMs and going to credit cards, and usually we had the incumbents in the finance industry adopting all these technological revolutions. But in the last 10 years or so, the pace of technological advancements has been much faster than before. But maybe even more peculiar and more exciting is the fact that a lot of the technologies are being introduced from the outside, trying to change the structure of the industry and challenge the incumbents. This is why this fintech wave has been so exciting and has generated so much attention. Today, we have two excellent guests to talk about these changes and what is on the horizon for fintech. We have Alesia Haas , who is the CFO of Coinbase. And we have Michelle Lai , who is a Wharton alum and key player in many of the crypto startups and innovations. Among other roles, she is a board member of the Electric Coin Company. Goldstein: It\u2019s great to have you, Alesia and Michelle. We are all thinking about cryptocurrencies. Starting from Bitcoin, we had many other cryptocurrencies, and still have them, and they go up and down. If you\u2019re an outsider who is seeing some of the developments, but not fully understanding what\u2019s going on, what can you say about crypto? Has crypto now become mainstream? Is it about to become mainstream? Is it meeting the expectations given what we had in mind when it started? Alesia, let\u2019s start with you. Alesia Haas: Thank you for having me. It is no longer debated whether crypto is here to stay. That was a conversation we had 10 years ago. Today, it is solidified. It is a mainstream asset class. You can look to examples of this. The ETF (exchange-traded fund) approvals that we had starting in January of this year with the Bitcoin ETF, and then just this summer, with the Ethereum ETF, have now given crypto the official stamp of approval from both regulators and major institutional partners. And we\u2019ve seen incredible engagement there. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have become the fastest growing ETFs of all time. There were over $17 billion in net inflows, and we are seeing broad adoption. We\u2019re seeing new capital flow into these ETFs. We can also point to the number of people that own crypto, both in the U.S. and globally. Over 52 million Americans have transactions in crypto, and 400 million people around the globe. When you look at the G20 countries, you can see that they are driving regulation in their markets. You can see this with MiCA in the EU (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation). In the U.S., we have bipartisan support for crypto regulation, even though we have not seen the approvals that we need here to have comprehensive regulation. Then we get into new products, like stablecoins. Layer 2 is like Base , which is a protocol that we\u2019ve built on top of Ethereum, which enables fast, cheap transactions. We are seeing huge developer activity now, building new apps on these protocols that enable fast, cheap, easy-to-use fintech products. [They will] then become daily conversations, daily use cases. How do we use payments that are fast, cheap, global? We\u2019ve seen developer activity. We saw eight times sequential developer activity in Base in the middle of the year. We saw growth in Q3. And so, this is where we really think that the future is going \u2013 to build these ubiquitous, fast, cheap, global payment infrastructures. Goldstein: Great. Michelle, what do you think about it from where you sit in the industry? Michelle Lai: I don\u2019t blame some people for having doubt. We\u2019ve gone through a lot of market cycles. Many existential crises, the most recent one being, I think in 2022, when a lot of the centralized crypto players went down. Growing out of that, we have persisted. To Alesia\u2019s data points, we have regulators coming in. We have governments wanting to implement CBDCs (central bank digital currencies), and a lot of other initiatives that I see as indicators that the world now has moved on from asking \u201cWill it stick around?\u201d You have all your large financial players, like PayPal, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton \u2013 even UBS, a couple of days ago \u2013 making their mark in the industry. These are organizations that don\u2019t change their minds very often on the big things. Goldstein: You both mentioned that this is here to stay. It\u2019s now effect on the ground, it\u2019s big. There are a lot of people paying attention to it, trading it, investing in it. But the main question that comes to mind is, how exactly is it going to change the financial system? Is this going to make consumers\u2019 lives easier in any way? Is this going to reform the way that we are doing payments, the way that we are consuming and paying for things? What should we expect going forward from fintech, and from cryptocurrency more specifically? How Crypto Could Transform How We Transact Haas: This is the first time that we\u2019ve seen a new payment rail. So much of the innovation over the last couple of decades has been in better user experiences \u2013 front-end technology \u2013 but they\u2019ve been going through similar back-end rails. Now we\u2019re innovating from the rails up. That is what I think is going to transform the next generation. We\u2019ve moved from the internet standpoint; we were online, and now we\u2019re moving on chain. This is really the next generation of the internet. We\u2019re going to be rebuilding transactions, as well as a lot of just social applications, on these new rails. I do think that we are going to see crypto blockchains transform the way we transact. It\u2019s going to bring value and data closer together into transactions, and that will then underpin all of the financial transactions. My belief is that we are going to see this happen behind the scenes in many ways, and so I think we\u2019ll get to a place where everyone is transacting on crypto rails, and they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re doing it. One of the things that is different about crypto today is, we talked about, \u201cI bridged my asset, and I\u2019m sending it on chain, and it\u2019s alphanumeric characters.\u201d That is for the early crypto adopters. This (new phase) is for advanced users. This is too complex for mass market adoption. But we\u2019re seeing a lot of progress now with it. For example, Coinbase released Basenames . Now I can send you crypto on chain just with a simple name, like an email address. This is where we need to go with crypto to make it ubiquitous and easy-to-use for everybody. But yes, I think payments will happen on chain. When you think about this rail, you think about credit cards. They\u2019re expensive for the merchant \u2013 not for the individual consumer. You think about ACH. It is slow. Cheaper, but slower. It takes two to three days. Then you think about [systems] like Alipay, which are fast and cheap, but they\u2019re not global. They\u2019re very much a closed loop system. Crypto is fast, cheap, global. That is what is unique about crypto, which is what\u2019s going to drive a lot of adoption. Goldstein: Michelle, where do you see the main uses? Lai: One thing I love about Coinbase is how it\u2019s been such a proponent for consumers \u2013 how to use crypto in their everyday lives, how to make their lives a lot easier and faster. Just one point to add to the consumer side is, recently, Stripe acquired a stablecoin company for more than $1 billion. This is a reverse acquisition, because this company was trying to be the Stripe of crypto. From within these companies, we\u2019re trying to rebuild rails that have existed pretty well, but now [it is] time for a revamp. Coinbase has been supporting many of these large issuers on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, ETF side. The part that I really like that Coinbase is helping is with what you call real world assets. These are where you can invest your tokens such that the underlying issuer invests in money market funds. It\u2019s a reverse crossover, which I like. The banking and mergers and acquisitions industry could also apply crypto and crypto-adjacent technologies to improve the deal-making process. For example, in an M&A deal, there are a lot of trust assumptions between each party. So far, we\u2019ve intermediated that by paying escrow agents or assuming that the repeat game set-up ensures that people will act fairly. But there are very cutting-edge, frontier math-based technologies that can obviate some of those trust assumptions. I\u2019m super excited about that. Also, Singapore just announced a framework for commercializing tokenization for funds and fixed income. They\u2019ve involved 40 organizations and seven countries in some of these experiments since, I think, a couple years ago, or even more than that. So, I\u2019m super excited for how the industry that most Wharton people graduate into will be influenced and upgraded through crypto and crypto-related technologies. Could Stablecoins Tame Crypto Volatility? Goldstein: You both mentioned stablecoins, and from what I hear around, this is indeed an area where people have a lot of hope for. The reason that some people are skeptical about cryptocurrencies is just the huge volatility. You look at the prices \u2013 it\u2019s like a roller coas",

Goal Learn when leading the charge gives you a competitive edge \u2014 and when it\u2019s better to wait. Nano Tool In high-stakes business decisions \u2014 whether launching a product, negotiating a deal, or raising a critical point in a meeting \u2014 timing is everything. Research shows that going first can establish dominance, shape the playing field, and create a lasting advantage. For instance, making the first offer in a negotiation sets an anchor \u2014 a reference point that strongly influences how the rest of the conversation unfolds. But sometimes, the real power lies in going last: gathering intelligence; reading the room; and making the final, decisive move. Studies also show that when one side has more information about the context, options, or likely outcomes, holding back can lead to a better result. Leaders often face the challenge of choosing between these two strategies without a clear roadmap. But it turns out that there is a simple solution to making the go-first-or-go-last decision that depends entirely on two factors. Leaders who understand the nature of the competition (factor one) and take into account the number of competitors involved (factor two) are more likely to strike the right balance. Action Steps When your goal is to influence the judgment of an external audience \u2014 such as investors, customers, or selection committees \u2014 your position in the line-up can make a difference. Going first or last can affect how your message is received, depending on the number of competitors and the structure of the competition. Understanding these order effects \u2014 how the timing of your presentation shapes perceptions \u2014 can help you choose the spot that offers the greatest advantage. 1. Assess the Nature of the Competition. The best timing strategy depends on how the decision is made: being selected from a list (like an election ballot) or evaluated one at a time (such as an interview). If chosen from a list, aim for the top spot \u2014 most people see the first option as more credible. In sequential evaluations, it\u2019s better to go last, as recency effects and high standards for early competitors can lead to more favorable evaluations later. 2. How Many Candidates Are There? With two options, the first usually wins \u2014 customers often pick the first salesperson or product they see. With many choices, recency bias favors later options, making it advantageous to go last. If you have a say in how a selection process is structured, and you want to promote legitimacy and cooperation, consider how the two factors can be used differently. 3. Implement a Randomized, Rotational System. To ensure fairness when selecting one option from a group of options, use a randomized, rotational system. For example, on a political ballot, the most equitable approach is to have each name appear equally in every position across different precincts. This method supports democratic principles and reduces the impact of political maneuvering and bias. 4. Use Randomization in Sequential Competitions. When decisions are made after options are presented one by one, randomization is the fairest approach. While it doesn\u2019t completely eliminate order effects \u2014 those who go later will still have an advantage \u2014 it ensures that each participant has an equal chance of benefiting from the later position. 5. Enhance Fairness in Multi-Round Competitions. In competitions with multiple rounds, fairness can be improved by randomizing the starting order in the first round and reversing the order in the second round. This method prevents the compounding advantage of going last in the first round and ensures a more balanced competition. How It\u2019s Used The Power of Going Last: In venture capital pitch meetings, the last entrepreneur to present often has an edge. Research shows that when investors hear multiple pitches in sequence, they tend to compare each new one to those that came before. As a result, the final presenter can frame their idea as a response to earlier shortcomings \u2014 positioning themselves as the strongest contender. This \u201crecency effect\u201d helps them leave a lasting impression when it matters most: right before the decision is made. \u200b The Power of Going First: In real estate negotiations, the initial listing price often serves as a powerful anchor, significantly influencing buyers\u2019 perceptions and subsequent offers. Studies have demonstrated that higher starting prices are associated with higher selling prices, as they set a reference point that shapes the negotiation process. For instance, research published in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization found that higher listing prices led to higher final sale prices, consistent with the anchoring effect. Understanding and strategically setting this initial anchor can provide a significant advantage in negotiations. Learn more about capturing first-mover advantages in this Nano Tool . Fairness in Multi-round Competitions : Many startup accelerators, such as Y Combinator and Techstars, use multi-stage evaluation processes to assess applicants. Rather than relying on a single pitch or meeting, these programs evaluate startups across several rounds \u2014 application reviews, interviews, and ongoing mentorship. This structure helps reduce bias by allowing evaluators to gather more data over time, spot consistent patterns of performance, and avoid overemphasizing a single strong (or weak) showing.

Goal Deploy AI systems with confidence by ensuring they are fair, transparent, and accountable \u2014 minimizing risk and maximizing long-term value. Nano Tool As organizations accelerate their use of AI, the pressure is on leaders to ensure these systems are not only effective but also responsible. A misstep can result in regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and loss of trust. Accountability must be designed in from the start \u2014 not bolted on after deployment. Action Steps 1. Define Clear Use Cases and Boundaries Specify a well-understood purpose for each AI system. Document what the AI should and should not do, including red lines (e.g., no use of facial recognition in sensitive contexts). Link the use case directly to business goals and ethical commitments. 2. Establish a Governance Framework Form a cross-functional governance board or policy that includes leaders from legal, risk, ethics, and operations \u2014 not just data science. Set standards, review high-impact use cases, and update guardrails regularly as technologies and risks evolve. 3. Assign Human Accountability Designate a person or team responsible for the AI system\u2019s behavior and impact \u2014 beyond technical oversight. Ensure this group has legal, ethical, and operational authority, as well as clear pathways for raising and addressing concerns in real time. 4. Ensure Explainability Use AI models that can be explained to non-experts. Communicate what the model does, what it\u2019s trained on, and why it made specific decisions. If a decision can\u2019t be explained, it can\u2019t be trusted. 5. Test for Bias and Harm Regularly audit AI outputs for unintended bias or discriminatory impact, aligned with organizational values and risk tolerance. Simulate edge cases using synthetic or real-world data, and embed fairness checks throughout the development lifecycle. 6. Document and Communicate Decisions Maintain clear records of how the AI was trained, tested, deployed, and updated. Share high-level information with stakeholders and employees to build trust, and continue to evaluate systems post-deployment. How Organizations Use It The following examples detail current responsible AI (RAI) governance and activity. JP Morgan Extensive, visible RAI activity throughout the firm; head of AI policy reports to the CEO; chief information security officer released a public letter to third-party suppliers (April 2025); dedicated RAI governance w/i model risk; 20+ staff (not counting other RAI functions); in-house RAI development and research. Salesforce Office of Ethical and Humane Use (now part of its broader RAI efforts) established in 2018 to guide product development in line with ethical principles and to proactively tackle emerging ethical and safety challenges associated with technology \u2014 especially AI; office includes ethicists, policy experts, researchers, and technologists who work across the company to assess risk and build trust; RAI is incorporated in enterprise goal-setting. Mastercard Established an AI Governance Council to oversee AI initiatives through cross-functional review, human oversight, and ethical guardrails; formalized Data and Tech Responsibility Principles , including privacy, transparency, accountability, fairness, and inclusion as core pillars; recently partnered with Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (Mila) to advance RAI research \u2014 particularly in bias testing and mitigation \u2014 and is bringing those findings into real-world AI deployments.

      "content_text": "Loading the Elevenlabs Text to Speech AudioNative Player\u2026 The following article was written by Wharton marketing professor Z. John Zhang . Dynamic pricing isn\u2019t new. Airlines, hotels, and ride-hailing companies have long relied on it to balance demand and supply, maximize profitability, and serve different types of customers. But in 2025, dynamic pricing is spreading rapidly across industries \u2014 from grocery retail to fast food to fashion e-commerce to tickets for the upcoming FIFA World Cup \u2014 powered by artificial intelligence, digital price tags, and real-time demand data. The current tariff uncertainties and inflation concerns are further impetus for firms to flirt with, and even embrace, dynamic pricing. Done right, dynamic pricing can benefit both firms and consumers. Done poorly, it can trigger backlash and erode trust. Why Dynamic Pricing Works The economic logic is straightforward: Customer willingness to pay varies. It varies across customers, and for the same customer, across occasions and over time. A family booking a vacation months in advance has a very different willingness to pay than an executive booking a same-day flight, and almost everyone is willing to pay more for roses on Valentine\u2019s Day than on any other day. Dynamic pricing helps companies capitalize on this variation, charging a high-willingness-to-pay customer a high price and a low-willingness-to-pay customer a low price at the right time. In the airline industry, leisure travelers secure affordable tickets by booking early, while business travelers can still find seats at the last minute, albeit at a higher price. Uber\u2019s surge pricing \u2014 which is a specific type of dynamic pricing \u2014 not only helps match riders to drivers but also attracts more drivers into busy zones, increasing supply when it\u2019s most needed. The principle holds across industries. When prices reflect demand and capacity in real time, resources are allocated more efficiently, and customers often have more choice. Firms, of course, stand to reap more short-term profits by charging more to those who are willing to pay more, while accommodating those who can afford to pay only a low price, thus getting both high margins and high volumes for their products or services. The Expanding Frontier It is not surprising to see that several industries are experimenting with new forms of dynamic pricing: Retail: Walmart is rolling out\u00a0electronic shelf labels\u00a0(ESLs) across 2,300 stores in the U.S., enabling real-time pricing based on demand, inventory, and competition. Competitors including Kroger, Whole Foods, and Lidl are following suit. Airlines: Delta plans to expand AI-driven dynamic pricing from 3% to 20% of domestic flights in 2025, raising both revenue potential and questions about fairness. Fast food: Wendy\u2019s is investing $20 million in AI-powered digital menu boards that adjust burger prices by time of day \u2014 higher at lunch rush, lower at off-peak times. Fashion: Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing are deploying AI to adjust clothing prices based on demand spikes and competitor moves, with potential ripple effects across the fast-fashion industry. Hospitality: Marriott has quietly extended dynamic pricing to loyalty points, with cash and points rates swinging dramatically week to week. Sports: FIFA announced that the tickets for its 2026 World Cup will be sold using dynamic pricing. In 1994, the last time the U.S. sponsored the game, there was no dynamic pricing unless tickets were purchased through a scalper. The Risks of Getting It Wrong History offers cautionary tales. Coca-Cola\u2019s 1999 experiment with vending machines that raised prices in hot weather drew swift backlash, with critics calling it exploitative. The company shelved the idea in the U.S. Wendy\u2019s recent surge pricing announcement triggered a similar outcry and provided a good lesson on what can go wrong with introducing dynamic pricing. Even FIFA\u2019s announcement about future dynamic pricing did not go unnoticed, drawing a New Yok Post headline, \u201cWorld Cup\u2019s dynamic-priced tickets will cost an arm and a leg \u2014 and ruin the global game.\u201d Wendy\u2019s case is worthy of some special attention. In early 2024, Wendy\u2019s CEO Kirk Tanner announced the company\u2019s intention to invest $20 million on high-tech menu boards that can change prices in real time. This means that a Dave\u2019s burger can cost more during busy times like lunch and dinner. The intention here is not a bad one. By charging higher prices at busy times, Wendy\u2019s can shift some of the demand to less busy times, reducing the peak-load staffing as well as some stress for its workers. In addition, with a smaller lunch or dinner crowd, customers would spend less time waiting for their orders at peak times. However, the prospect of dynamic pricing was immediately interpreted by the media and the public as an Uber type of surge pricing for burgers, and it was taken as another example of a greedy corporation trying to exploit customers. Critics noted that unlike Uber, higher prices don\u2019t magically create more burgers at lunchtime and hungry customers get the short end of the stick. Not surprisingly, significant negative public reaction ensued, with \u201c#BoycottWendys\u201d trending on social media. The lesson: Consumers instinctively do not like dynamic pricing or understand it. They resist when it feels like opportunism and when it is not clear what is in it for them. Even in the airline industry, where customers are long used to price variations, dynamic pricing has fueled perceptions of unfairness, making airlines a perennial symbol of consumer frustration. The fact of the matter is that customers have nothing to fear about dynamic pricing. When and How to Use Dynamic Pricing Basic economics dictates that when all following three conditions are present, it is a non-brainer for a firm in any industry to embrace dynamic pricing. First, customer willingness to pay for your firm\u2019s product or services varies over time. Second, your firm has the capability to identify when a customer is willing to pay a high or low price. Third, your firm finds a good way to communicate and implement dynamic pricing without alienating customers. Your firm can avoid alienating customers if dynamic pricing improves access, availability, or fairness for them. The first condition is generally satisfied when: Demand fluctuates significantly. Airlines, hotels, and trains provide textbook examples. Capacity is constrained. A limited number of seats, cars, or rooms justifies price variation. Costs vary over time. Fresh food near expiration or energy-intensive services during peak hours benefit from flexible pricing. Supply can respond. Uber\u2019s surge pricing works because higher fares attract more drivers. The second condition is always achievable if a firm is willing to make sufficient investments in information gathering, processing, and displaying technologies. Big data and AI capabilities have certainly motivated many firms to look in the direction of dynamic pricing today. But capability alone isn\u2019t enough. Firms must anticipate customer reaction, communicate transparently, and frame price changes around value creation rather than profit extraction. For this reason, the third condition is critical to the success or failure in implementing dynamic pricing. Coming back to Wendy\u2019s PR disaster, the company clarified later that they had \u201cno plans\u201d to raise prices when demand is high. It wants to use its digital menu boards to offer discounts and other value offers during slower periods, not to charge more during peak times. In other words, Wendy\u2019s never wanted to embrace surge pricing, and it intended to offer what I called \u201cdynamic discounting.\u201d Unfortunately, that intention was lost in communication, partially due to the fact that Wendy\u2019s was not clear about it. With dynamic discounting, a firm starts with a fixed regular price and offers variable discounts. Such a mechanism can generate any price point that dynamic pricing can. For instance, Wendy\u2019s can charge its price for Dave\u2019s burgers dynamically, $6 at 11 a.m. to noon, $8 at noon to 1 p.m., and $7 at 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. However, when framed as dynamic discounting, the regular price for the burger becomes $8, and Wendy\u2019s can offer $2 off at 11 a.m. to noon, and $1 off from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Dynamic discounting is then much more palatable to customers because nearly everyone gets a trophy. \u201cEveryone gets a trophy\u201d may not be the smartest idea in competitive sports, but it can help to endear customers to dynamic pricing. Similarly, with dynamic discounting, Coca-Cola could have easily set its regular prices based on hot weather and offered colder weather discounts to avoid consumer backlash. FIFA can use it to shift media and customer focus away from speculating on outlandish prices \u201cfor a top-tier seat for the July 19 final at East Rutherford, New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium.\u201d Dynamic pricing is becoming a competitive necessity. What Consumers Can Do The fact of the matter is that customers have nothing to fear about dynamic pricing. If anything, dynamic pricing shifts power to savvy consumers. Those who monitor fluctuations, book at the right time, or shop across platforms can consistently secure lower prices. In a dynamic pricing world, knowledge is power. Stock prices are dynamic. Because of it, savvy investors can buy low and sell high. For goods and services without such cycles, consumers still benefit from dynamic pricing in many ways. For instance, Amtrak tickets between Philadelphia and New York can vary from $10 to $200, and informed buyers can exploit the swings by being vigilant and diligent. Without dynamic pricing, Amtrak would have to charge a much higher everyday price to everyone, its train service would become much less accessible, and trains would run with many more empty seats. Yes, under dynamic pricing, some consumers will inevitably pay higher prices. \u00a0However, when done right, the consumers who face higher prices will also be the ones who could a",

      "content_text": "Presidential election seasons are defined by the policies that candidates pitch, but the viability of those policies is not always within the grasp of the voting public, businesses, and the rest of the economy. In a new Wharton series called \u201c Policies That Work ,\u201d Wharton faculty experts assess the feasibility of the electoral promises made by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The first panel of the series, held on October 23, 2024, focused on the federal debt, trade policies, and the future of the U.S. economy. Sharing their insights were Jeremy Siegel , professor emeritus of finance, and Kent Smetters , professor of business economics and public policy and faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM), with session moderator Joao Gomes , professor of finance and senior vice dean of research, centers, and academic initiatives. Watch the full panel or read some key takeaways below: Containing the Federal Debt Both Donald Trump (Republican) and Kamala Harris (Democrat) have promised tax incentives such as scrapping taxes on tips and Social Security payments, and expanded child tax credits, even as the U.S. federal debt is at record levels. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it. Even without either candidate, we are on an explosive path in terms of the debt,\u201d Smetters said. Going that route in the present times would mean contraction in the economy, and lower wages, which then would warrant tough corrective action, he warned. \u201cWhile our fiscal house is burning down, both candidates are moving in more furniture.\u201d If raising taxes is the solution to fund those tax breaks, it would mean an \u201cimmediate and permanent\u201d increase of 33% on all federal taxes. If spending cuts is the option, that would mean a 25% scythe across the board, including Social Security benefits. Those two scenarios are based on the current debt trajectory \u201cand if we acted today. The longer we wait, the harder it becomes,\u201d he said. Siegel said excessive debt offerings by the government will raise the interest rate on long-term treasury bonds, which then would make everything more expensive, such as buying a home or financing for firms. At that point, the government will be forced to either cut spending and/or increase taxes, he added. Outlook for Interest Rates A Republican sweep where the party leads the House, the Senate, and the presidency will enable \u201ca free reign for goodies,\u201d Siegel said. That could trigger a spike in interest rates, but rates may come down after \u201csome soothing words\u201d by those elected, he added. He did not foresee any big increase in interest rates in three to five years, or to levels that would hurt the economy. Interest rates will have to respond when the federal debt grows to 175% of GDP, said Smetters. A Penn Wharton Budget Model brief noted that under current policy, the debt-to-GDP ratio would grow from 98% in 2023 to 150% by 2045; the debt becomes unsustainable beyond 200% of GDP, PWBM warned. \u201c[Those high debt levels are] not mathematically possible, either without explicitly defaulting or implicitly defaulting,\u201d Smetters said. Implicit default could occur either through monetization, which would result in higher inflation, or by pruning liabilities like Social Security and Medicare, he explained. Siegel sees some light on that front. Foreigners own a third of U.S. debt, and the U.S.-owned portion is the remaining two-thirds, he pointed out. \u201cThe debt-to-world GDP ratio or the U.S. portion of [the debt-to-GDP] doesn\u2019t look as scary. I see an ability to absorb the deficit that we have.\u201d Tax Cuts and the Effects on the U.S. Economy \u201cTrump is way more expensive, and Harris is a lot cheaper,\u201d Smetters said. \u201cNonetheless, neither candidate has proposed anything that both reduces debt and grows the economy.\u201d Trump wants to extend tax cuts to higher-income households and corporate income tax. Harris proposes to increase taxes on higher marginal payers, and also increase the corporate income tax. Many provisions of the 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including individual income tax rate cuts, are temporary and will expire on December 21, 2025; the corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% is permanent. If there is a split in control of Congress, there will be \u201chuge negotiation on taxes,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cEverything will be on the table.\u201d If the Republicans sweep Congress, they could extend all the tax cuts if the bond markets signal approval with interest rates, he predicted. \u201cThe long bond market tells politicians whether they have to act.\u201d How Higher Import Tariffs Could Backfire Trump wants to impose stiff tariffs on imports (60% on Chinese goods and 20% on all others). A 20% tariff increase would cause the dollar to rise by about 10%, offsetting the price impact on goods to that extent, Siegel said. But higher import tariffs might provoke exporting countries to retaliate, he added. \u201cIf everyone retreats to barriers by taxes, that\u2019s not going to help anyone.\u201d Such retaliation could cause a contraction of the economy, which in turn would lead to lower taxes than the higher revenues from tariff increases, Siegel continued. But the biggest cost of those tariffs will be felt more on the capital account than the current account, Smetters said. \u201cWhen you have more debt, that also lowers capital flows across countries, which makes it harder for our government to sell debt,\u201d he added. Reading Market Expectations \u201cThe stock market would prefer a Trump victory,\u201d cheering his plan to extend tax cuts, including to long-term capital gains, Siegel said. But the bond market may not relish that (because of the impact on the federal debt and interest rates), he added. At the same time, \u201cthe market likes a legislative split; they like Congress to keep tabs on [the parties], he added. Smetters agreed: \u201cThe market wants gridlock. That would be the perfect outcome for them.\u201d \u201cThe other market that really matters for the average American is the housing market,\u201d Gomes pointed out. Here, Harris\u2019s proposed tax credits of up to $25,000 for first-time homebuyers is unrealistic because of supply shortages, Smetters said. What would really help younger homebuyers is lower interest rates, made possible with a sustainable debt policy. \u201cThink about doubling your house bill as you go from a 3% borrowing rate to a 6% or 7% borrowing rate. That is way more important than a $25,000 credit,\u201d Smetters said. Home prices are up 45% since the COVID pandemic began, but along with the cost of an 80% mortgage, they have risen almost 150%, Siegel added. Missing the Math Harris\u2019s proposal to avoid raising taxes for households that earn less than $400,000 annually is \u201cmathematically impossible,\u201d Smetters said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough money at the high-income [levels].\u201d Both parties have pledged not to touch Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, including increasing the retirement age. \u201cIt\u2019s not mathematically possible either,\u201d said Smetters. Higher minimum wages also don\u2019t evenly spread the gains. Both Smetters and Siegel said the earned income-tax credit (EITC) is far more effective in redistribution than higher minimum wages. Proposals by both parties to create more manufacturing jobs also seem to be overambitious. The idea is to \u201cbring back the halcyon days of the 1960s, when manufacturing jobs were among the highest paying jobs,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not the world today.\u201d \u201cBoth parties are so disconnected from reality that the stakes in the ground don\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Smetters said.

      "content_text": "Professor Itay Goldstein is joined by Hyun Song Shin, economic adviser and head of research at the Bank for International Settlements, and Loretta Mester, former President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Together, they explore the 2023 banking crisis , focusing on the collapse of Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank, and other small to mid-level banks, while analyzing regulatory gaps and future protections for the banking system. This discussion is part of a special series called \u201cFuture of Finance.\u201d Watch the video or read the edited transcript below. Listen to a podcast of the conversation here (also on Spotify and Apple Podcasts ). Transcript Common Threads in Financial Crises Itay Goldstein: In March of 2023, we had an unusual string of events in the global banking arena. Failures of institutions here in the United States \u2014 Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank of New York, and First Republic Bank. And the turmoil in Credit Suisse over in Europe. This was the biggest episode altogether since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, and it had a ripple effect on financial markets worldwide, financial institutions, and the global economy, with quick intervention from regulators in Europe and in the United States. Looking now at the future of banking, we are looking into a new era with some new lessons that have been learned and some new policies that will be in place. I\u2019m here with Hyun and Loretta to dive into these topics and learn some more, and talk about what we can expect going forward. Let me get started by thinking about what happened in March of 2023. What were the causes of these events? Is there any common unifying theme? Is there any connection to the policies that were in place in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Hyun, why don\u2019t you get started? Hyun Song Shin: Yes, Itay, Those are very good questions, and we can certainly learn lessons from what happened in the spring of 2023. In some ways, there are some classical lessons from the events both in the U.S. and in Europe, but in very important respects, the banking stress last spring was very unlike what we saw during the GFC. The GFC was a major systemic banking crisis when many [highly] leveraged institutions were under stress on the funding side. The theme was very much on the wholesale funding of these large banks, and you may recall all the discussions about shadow banking, special purpose vehicles and so on. It\u2019s important to bear in mind the macro backdrop. We had this burst of inflation in 2021, and so central banks raised rates in 2022.What that meant was that some of the securities holdings of banks lost value in a marked-to-market sense. But many of these securities were held on an ultra maturity basis, which meant that the losses needn\u2019t be recognized as they lose value. In the case of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), for example, there was already a very large increase in deposits, which were then put into these securities. But when you have a run, you do need to sell the assets, and that\u2019s when the losses would be realized. So, that was a particular feature of the macro environment at that time, but it wasn\u2019t a systemic crisis in the same way that the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was. The story with Credit Suisse was somewhat different still, because this was a major, globally systemic banking institution. It wasn\u2019t a retail institution in the same way that some of the smaller banks were in the U.S. But what it saw was after a series of mishaps in its business, the stresses that were happening at that time meant that its wholesale creditors were similarly withdrawing their funding. And so, it was a slightly different episode, but it shares the same kinds of commonalities in the sense that it was a liability-side driven event that interacted with the asset side. That would be one way of putting it. Goldstein: Thank you. And Loretta, some reflections from you? The Vulnerabilities of Uninsured Deposits Loretta Mester: Fundamentally, there were two key factors for SVB, and they were just doing very poor interest rate risk management. As Hyun said, the bank had tripled in size in a very short period of time in terms of its assets, and it was funding those securities with a very high proportion of uninsured deposits. Over 90% of its short term funding was uninsured deposits. So they were very vulnerable, and they weren\u2019t really managing that risk. In fact, they leaned into that risk, because they moved securities into the [specific] maturity buckets on their balance sheet so they wouldn\u2019t have to mark them to market. They were also vulnerable in another way, in the sense that they had a very concentrated depositor base. So, a majority of their deposits came from firms that were in tech and venture capital. Of course, when venture capital [firms] got under, their activity started declining as interest rates increased. They found themselves in trouble, and they really weren\u2019t managing that risk at all. But there was a second factor. We know banks are set up to lend long and borrow short, and so they are subject to interest rate risk, and it\u2019s up to them to manage the risk. We also have bank supervision, and supervisors are supposed to make sure that banks are managing their risks in a safe and sound manner so that they can continue to lend and serve their important roles for their customers. In this case, bank supervision also was very weak. The Fed was responsible for much of this. The Fed didn\u2019t really understand the vulnerabilities of SVB, especially as the institution grew in size. Once the vulnerabilities were fully appreciated, the supervisors didn\u2019t act quickly enough and forcefully enough to get the SVB management to fix the problems they were having. So, it would be a combination of both poor interest rate management and risk management on the part of SVB. Combined with [all that was] weak bank supervision, and that really wasn\u2019t done with speed and agility in a changing interest rate environment. So, when interest rates began rising and they rose aggressively, it revealed the vulnerabilities in that bank. Depositors woke up and said, \u201cOh, we have some concerns here.\u201d They were alerted to this fact because SVB tried to do a capital raise and had to sell assets to do that, and so they had to take those losses. Then depositors started to run, and while it wasn\u2019t a systemic event at the moment, it did cause runs at other banks, such as First Republic and Signature Bank. There was concern that it would become a systemic event, and many large regional banks suffered in terms of depositors running. This may be indicative of [the fact that] we have not solved the too-big-to-fail [issue]. The deposits ran into very large banks, because the depositors believe that those banks would not be allowed to fail. So we have not solved that problem. Coming out of the financial crisis, there were a lot of reforms done. The Dodd-Frank [Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010] was to try to address the too-big-to-fail problem. This episode shows that that has not been adequately addressed. So, I agree with Hyun that there\u2019s there are lessons here, certainly [with respect to how] the regulators and the Federal Reserve do supervision and also regulatory changes. But here, I put more of the burden on the supervisory part of it, not the regulations themselves. Takeaways for Monetary Policy Formulation Goldstein: You both mentioned the connection to monetary policy, and Loretta, you said that there are lessons now going forward for supervision and regulation. But another question is, what are the lessons going forward for the way that the Fed is conducting monetary policy, to the extent that you can say something about that? Mester: Remember, this all happened in early March [2023], and there was an FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting on March 22 of that year. At that meeting, the Fed persevered [with] its interest rate increase, so it did another increase of 25 basis points. We didn\u2019t allow the stresses in the banking system, per se, to deter from what needed to be done from a monetary policy point of view, given where inflation was. Inflation at the time was running above 5%, and it was clearly well above the goal of 2%, and unemployment was very low at the time. So, of course, the obvious thing to do with your monetary policy is to tighten interest rates again. There was certainly a lot of focus on whether those stresses would become wider spread, and there was concern. If you recall, when SVB failed, the Fed also had to set up an emergency lending facility, the Bank Term Funding program, which allowed banks the faced liquidity issues to put the securities they were holding on their balance sheets at face value; they could actually put them at the Fed at fair value and borrow against them so they wouldn\u2019t have to sell them. That program, combined with what the Treasury and FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) did for some of the banks, basically said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that all deposits are insured,\u201d that quelled the stresses. The FOMC felt that there was risk out there of continuing on its campaign of raising interest rates, but it was the right thing to do from a monetary policy point of view. And then we\u2019d have to very, very be attuned to those risks. You need a healthy banking system for two reasons. One, you want monetary policy, whatever you take on the policy front, to transmit through the broader economy when the financial markets aren\u2019t working. When they\u2019re disrupted, monetary policy won\u2019t transmit. But also, we wanted the banks to remain healthy and not pull back on all the credit extension, because they were actually helping to support the economy as well. There was a lot of discussion about continuing to monitor [the prevailing situation], but [also] to persevere and put another interest rate increase in. [The Fed] likes to use regulation, supervision and macro prudential [policie",

      "content_text": "In his new book, Lucky by Design: The Hidden Economics You Need to Get More of What You Want , Wharton business economics and public policy professor Judd Kessler pulls back the curtain on hidden markets that determine who gets what in everyday life \u2014 everything from scoring a reservation at the hot new restaurant to getting a job at a top company \u2014 and explains how to tip the scales in your favor. In the following excerpt from the book, Kessler describes what hidden markets are and the rules that underpin them. \u201cRock smashes scissors. Scissors cut paper. Paper covers rock.\u201d I used both hands \u2014 playing both the winning and losing side \u2014 as I showed my four-year-old daughter, Natalie, the possible outcomes of the game rock-paper-scissors. Learning the game of rock-paper-scissors was a rite of passage for Natalie. Her nine-year-old brother and six-year-old sister were already experts. First, they learned to play just for fun. The remarkably simple game can fill a surprising amount of time while kids are waiting for a city bus. Once they both knew how to play, however, they started to use it for its ultimate purpose: to settle disagreements Who chooses which cartoon they watch next? Do we have tacos or pizza for dinner? To the victor \u2014 of two out of three rounds \u2014 go the spoils. Natalie practiced the hand gestures and once she seemed to understand the rules, her older sister, Isla (pronounced \u201cEye-la,\u201d not \u201cIs-la,\u201d as she would confidently correct you), volunteered to challenge Natalie to her very first real game. The game was over almost as soon as it began. Natalie proceeded to throw scissors on every turn. Her older sister figured this out rather quickly and then won decisively with a few throws of rock. As I saw the disappointment creep onto Natalie\u2019s face, it was clear that her failure was mine. I had taught her the rules of the game, and I had demonstrated how it was played, but I had neglected to teach her any strategy. The stakes of her game were low, even if it didn\u2019t feel like it to Natalie at the time. But we all go through versions of this experience with outcomes far more consequential. We are routinely in situations where scarce resources are allocated in ways that we do not fully understand. Without understanding the rules of the game, you might assume that your outcomes are determined mostly by luck. But there are rules \u2014 often hidden and complex rules \u2014 that determine who gets what. When you aren\u2019t aware of them, you often wind up just like Natalie: using a suboptimal strategy and losing to people who seem to know tricks that you do not. People who end up unhappy about what they get conclude that they were unlucky or that the system was rigged against them. After enough of these experiences, they believe that\u2019s just how the world works. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. More than two decades before I became a rock-paper-scissors instructor to my third child, I was a student in economics at Harvard University. The allocations we observe can seem arbitrary and unfair. But there are rules that dictate how things are allocated in hidden markets, even if we aren\u2019t always aware of them. While still an undergraduate, I had been encouraged to take a PhD class taught by Alvin Roth, a brilliant and exceptionally kind-hearted economist with distinctive rectangular glasses and a light gray beard. Al was at the forefront of a new subfield of economics called market design. The subfield excited me in a way that other branches of economics did not. At its core was a big idea that changed the way I thought about the world. Economists \u2014 myself included \u2014 think of the world as a set of markets in which individuals try to get the best outcomes they can. Before studying with Al, I associated these markets with prices. Markets were where buyers paid sellers a price and got something in return. At the farmers\u2019 market, I could pay a price for produce. If I was willing to pay the price, I got the pears. If I was not, I left empty-handed. But the field of market design had a keen interest in different kinds of markets \u2014 markets that allocate valuable, scarce resources without relying on prices (or at least, without relying exclusively on them). Without prices, these markets need some other criteria to determine who gets what, and because the criteria are not always obvious or visible the way that prices are, I call them hidden markets. Once I better understood what a hidden market was, I started to see them everywhere, hiding in plain sight all around us. Hidden markets decide who gets the organs available for transplant, who gets the last hospital beds and ventilators, and who gets the earliest access to vaccines. Hidden markets decide who is admitted to the most prestigious colleges and who gets to work at the best firms \u2014 and, therefore, who ends up with the most power. They allocate seats in movie theaters and on planes, trains, and automobiles. They even decide who gets to marry the most desirable partners and who must do what within the households they form. The allocations we observe can seem arbitrary and unfair. But there are rules that dictate how things are allocated in hidden markets, even if we aren\u2019t always aware of them. Just like Natalie learning rock-paper-scissors, understanding why certain people get the best outcomes requires knowing these market rules. And once you know these rules, you can develop an optimal strategy so the best outcomes start going to you. Market rules are dictated by whoever controls access to the scarce resource. These rules might be chosen deliberately, or they might be based on historical accident or operational expediency. Market rules can be formalized, or they can be left unstated; they might be enforced by people or coded into software. And they can be designed poorly or designed well. What does it mean for market rules to be designed poorly or well? If we forgo prices because they introduce inequity or inefficiency or are too difficult, we should strive to make sure that the market rules that we use instead do better on these same three dimensions. We want rules that allocate things in a way that is equitable, efficient, and easy. In many hidden markets, the stakes are too high for you to go in blind. To others, it might seem like you just got lucky, but by better understanding these markets \u2014 and how to play in them \u2014 you will know you were lucky by design.

      "content_text": "Professor Itay Goldstein interviews Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine to examine the GameStop and AMC meme stock sagas and the powerful influence of social media on market events. The discussion highlights the role of behavioral finance in shaping investor actions and how social trends can disrupt financial markets on a global scale. This discussion is part of a special series called \u201cFuture of Finance.\u201d Watch the video or read the edited transcript below. Listen to a podcast of the conversation here (also on Spotify and Apple Podcasts ). Transcript Itay Goldstein: Hello, everyone. We are doing a miniseries of podcasts here at the Wharton School on the future of finance. Today, we are going to explore a new phenomenon \u2014 behavioral and social investing. Of course, behavioral investing is not a new phenomenon. We have known about it and talked about it for a long time. The new element that has come into it more recently is social investing \u2014 how behavioral investing is assisted by social media and the desire of people to participate in a social phenomenon, like a cultural phenomenon. And we saw different episodes of this with meme stocks, starting from GameStop and AMC and others. We have the best guest to dive into all this \u2014 Matt Levine , who is a columnist at Bloomberg and the author of the very famous Money Stuff newsletter. I\u2019m Itay Goldstein, a professor of finance at the Wharton School, and currently the chair of the finance department. I will conduct this conversation with you, Matt. In your May 13 issue of Money Stuff \u2014 in which, by the way, you generously link to the Wharton MBA curriculum \u2014 you ask the audience, \u201cIs this just how life is now?\u201d Is this the case? Are we going to expect more of these GameStop sagas, or is this just a unique phenomenon? Matt Levine: My gut is that it is more the former, that this is the way life is now. I think that GameStop was sort of a proof-of-concept. But really, ultimately, Bitcoin and crypto were a bigger proof of it \u2014 that something like social investing can work. Sometimes the way I think of it is that for most of the history of financial markets, people thought of the stock market as this sort of social gambling game, where you were trying to out-guess the other person. And then there was almost a brief blip of scientific finance, where people thought, \u201cOh, stocks are worth the present value of their future cash flows.\u201d We\u2019ve now gone back to the old system, where stocks are worth what you can get someone else to pay for them. People realize that you could harness social media technologies to collectively influence the prices of stocks. I think that that just remains true. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see GameStop again. The real insanity of that was because it was the first time and because it was such a novelty. But the basic idea [that] memes can drive the prices of financial instruments seems pretty well-established in crypto by this point, to the point that it\u2019s not even newsworthy. And it continues to reverberate through the stock market. Revisiting stock valuation models Goldstein: This is very interesting. Basically, what you\u2019re saying is that our models of finance where the value of a stock is going to be determined by the present value of future cash flows [are] a blip on the timeline of financial markets. And [that] people used to think about it in less scientific terms, and this is what we\u2019re going to see going forward? Levine: I\u2019m probably exaggerating when I say that. One thing that the GameStop episode taught you is that there\u2019s good reason to think that the present value of future cash flows of an asset set some sort of floor under the price of the asset, because if it goes to zero, then someone can go buy it and extract the cash flow to themselves. But I think people developed this rational system, where they assumed that the present value of the cash flows was also a cap on the value of the asset. There\u2019s no real reason for that. If a lot of retail investors want to bid up a thing for years at a time, then what you learned in GameStop was that there\u2019s not really a clear corrective mechanism, right? It\u2019s not like short sellers can come in and force the price down to a rational level. That, to me, is the lesson. That there\u2019s not a corrective mechanism in the short or medium term for just a meme-driven price. Goldstein: Right. It\u2019s very interesting that you draw the parallel to Bitcoin and crypto assets. When we talk about Bitcoin in the classroom, we say that there is really no clear way to price them. There is really no way to tell what the right price is for Bitcoin. So, you think that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are maybe the central phenomenon, and GameStop was maybe one other example of that? Levine: I think that, yes. GameStop being a stock that moved like a coordinated social movement for a few months was really interesting \u2014 [that] brought it to closer to the financial mainstream. That\u2019s also true in a less silly but more important way of Bitcoin, right? When you talk about how you value Bitcoin, any legitimate and real effort to value it is going to be based on its social adoption. If people buy it, then it\u2019s worth a lot of money. And if no one believes in it, then it\u2019s not worth a lot of money. That is the core of what happened in GameStop, where GameStop was also a company. But the real meme-driven stuff was about its popularity in a social investing universe. I think that Bitcoin is the clearer illustration of how strange this is, and how enduring it is. Bitcoin has had a five-figure valuation for years now. Its social adoption is enough to drive the value in a way that it wasn\u2019t really for the long term for GameStop. The \u201cCoordination Problem\u201d in Valuation Goldstein: Yes. When we talk about it as economists, we would think about it as a coordination problem, where if everyone thinks it\u2019s valuable, it will be valuable. If no one thinks it\u2019s valuable, it will not be valuable. And then it can end up anywhere in terms of price. Levine: Bitcoin [is] meant to be a currency. Everyone understands that it\u2019s a coordination problem. Whereas there\u2019s no reason for GameStop to work that way. It just did for a while. Goldstein: Right. Yes, exactly. This is where the deviation is. That with GameStop, there is a way to price it that is not based on coordination with Bitcoin. There isn\u2019t. But the fact that this migrated into GameStop and AMC was really the new thing, and maybe the very interesting element here. Diving a bit deeper into that, what do you think are the psychological and social triggers that were behind the AMC and GameStop saga? How would you characterize them? How Meme-stock Trading Was an Entertainment Option Levine: I do think that there is a cultural moment that is somewhat pandemic-driven. I mean, a lot of people were stuck at home. They had a lot fewer entertainment options. They were turning to the internet for entertainment because sporting events and television shows were canceled, and live events were canceled. There was a lower bar for entertainment. Going to a message board and talking about trading GameStop options was relatively more entertaining than it would have been at any other time. And it was just like a real [option] \u2014 it fed on itself, in the sense that people were having fun trading GameStop. GameStop [prices] went up. This got attention. GameStop went up more, and then it became like a truly insane event where people were making 10,000% returns in a couple of days. So, that attracted a lot of people. It was a combination of people making a lot of money very quickly, and also very evidently having a lot of fun doing it. One thing that happened in GameStop is that the stock went up a lot. But another thing that happened is that the number of users of the \u201c Wall Street Bets \u201d message board went from under a million to 8 million people in a couple of days. That was in a time where people were starved for entertainment and starved for social interaction, [and the message board] was a very fun place to be socializing. The coin of socializing there was you buying and holding GameStop. Goldstein: This is all sort of pandemic-era driven, as you say. But then when you saw this coming back in May of this year, what were you thinking? Levine: One thing I was thinking is, this can\u2019t work as well, again, just for entertainment reasons. It\u2019s just not as [much] fun the second time. And it wasn\u2019t, right? People were interested in it. Keith Gill , the influencer who was the main driving force behind the first GameStop rally \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true \u2014 came back to Twitter to tweet inscrutable things and to try to get the band back together. People who were interested in the stock shot up, and GameStop was able to do an at-the-market stock offering. But it didn\u2019t have either the financial or the cultural impact that it had the previous time \u2014 the stock did not go up that much. It got attention in the financial press. The original GameStop rally was on Good Morning America . It was the biggest news story in the world. Keith Gill coming back was like a financial niche news story. The Coordination Power of Retail Investors Goldstein: When we analyze financial markets, we tend to think about retail investors and institutional investors. The usual thinking is that institutional investors are going to be more sophisticated. They are the experts. They have time, they have money to do the research, and at the end of the day, they will know how to pick the stocks. Retail investors are maybe more na\u00efve, and they don\u2019t have the financial resources to make the right investment. At the end of the day, they might be taken advantage of. This was not exactly how things played out in these episodes. Did these episodes lead you to reconsider the way you\u2019re thinking about institutional versus retail investors? Levine: It suggests that retail investors have more power than you would have expected, right? I have read for years people talking \u2014 on Reddi",

Walther , a visiting scholar at Wharton and director of global alliance POZE . A humanitarian practitioner who spent over 20 years at the United Nations, Walther\u2019s current research focuses on leveraging AI for social good. Organizations face an ongoing challenge: operating across stakeholder groups that interpret information, assess risk, and make decisions through fundamentally different mental frameworks. Research from McKinsey indicates that generative AI could contribute $2.6-4.4 trillion annually to global GDP, yet realizing this potential requires solving the translation challenge between seemingly incompatible worldviews. Consider typical organizational dynamics: engineering teams prioritize technical elegance, sales teams focus on customer relationships, finance emphasizes risk mitigation, and marketing pursues brand differentiation. These groups often struggle to communicate effectively not due to language barriers, but because they operate from different foundational assumptions about value creation, risk assessment, and success metrics. The different viewpoints that clash in the context of AI integration are just the latest illustration of this. This communication breakdown extends beyond internal operations to market expansion, regulatory compliance, stakeholder engagement, and partnership development. The economic cost of these translation failures compounds across every business function. Where is the sweet spot that appeals to all \u2014 or at least, what is the biggest common denominator that creates a space of shared interest? Why AI Works as a Mindset Translator Understanding The Architecture of Human Experience Despite surface-level differences across cultures, generations, and professional backgrounds, every individual processes aspirations, emotions, thoughts, and sensations across four contextual levels: individual, community, national, and global. This framework operates similarly to a universal protocol underlying diverse software implementations. Just as TCP/IP enables communication between different computer systems, the human experiential matrix provides a common foundation that AI systems can leverage to translate between different cultural and professional worldviews. Some organizations already apply elements of this framework intuitively. Global consulting firms adapt their recommendations based on cultural context. Technology companies localize products beyond language to accommodate different decision-making patterns. Financial institutions adjust risk assessment models for different regulatory environments. AI can be applied at various levels of the human experiential matrix: Individual Level Aspirations : AI-powered career coaching apps that align personal goals with skills training and market demand. Emotions : Mental health chatbots (e.g., Woebot) that provide real-time support and coping strategies. Thoughts : Personalized learning platforms that adapt content to an individual\u2019s cognitive style and pace. Sensations : Wearable AI (like Fitbit or Apple Health AI) translating biometric data into actionable wellness advice. Community Level Aspirations : AI-driven local development planning that identifies and supports grassroots entrepreneurship. Emotions : Sentiment analysis in community forums to detect rising tensions and guide mediation efforts. Thoughts : AI tools for schools and libraries that curate locally relevant educational resources. Sensations : Smart city systems monitoring air quality, noise, or water quality to improve communal wellbeing. National Level Aspirations : AI for labor market forecasting, helping governments align education policy with future skills needs. Emotions : National-scale AI monitoring of social media to detect polarization and inform inclusive policymaking. Thoughts : AI-enhanced judicial systems for analyzing legal precedents to promote fairness and reduce backlog. Sensations : AI-enabled health surveillance predicting disease outbreaks and guiding public health interventions. Global Level Aspirations : AI models (like those used by UNDP) simulating scenarios for achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Emotions : AI-based cross-cultural translation that preserves tone and nuance to foster international diplomacy. Thoughts : Large-scale AI research collaborations (e.g., climate modeling with supercomputing) to accelerate discovery. Sensations : AI-enabled satellite data analysis for monitoring deforestation, ocean warming, and disaster response. The business logic is straightforward: Division creates costs, while understanding nurtures value. Translating Beyond Language Traditional language translation addresses syntax and vocabulary. Mental model translation addresses the deeper challenge of translating between different frameworks for interpreting reality, assessing risk, and making decisions. The concept of \u201cincommensurable paradigms,\u201d introduced in Euclid\u2019s Elements and later expanded on by Thomas Kuhn, refers to situations where competing theories lack common measurement standards. It applies directly to business contexts. Environmental sustainability advocates and financial efficiency experts often cannot communicate effectively because their underlying frameworks for evaluating solutions differ fundamentally. Advances in neurosymbolic AI now enable systems that can identify these deeper structural differences and create translation protocols between them. Neurosymbolic AI combines the strengths of two approaches: neural networks, which are good at recognizing patterns in messy real-world data (like images or speech), and symbolic reasoning, which is good at applying rules, logic, and structured knowledge. Together, they allow AI systems not just to see patterns, but also to understand and reason about them. This means such systems can bridge differences in how people think or express themselves \u2014 translating between intuitive, emotional perspectives and formal, rule-based frameworks. Practical applications include: Health Care Diagnostics: Combining pattern recognition from scans (neural) with medical knowledge bases (symbolic) to give explainable recommendations to doctors. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Parsing large volumes of contracts with neural models, while applying symbolic rules to flag inconsistencies or violations. Education and Tutoring : Adapting to a student\u2019s learning style (neural) while following structured curricula and pedagogical logic (symbolic). Cross-Cultural Translation: Neural systems capture nuance in language, while symbolic frameworks map cultural concepts and metaphors to preserve meaning. Robotics: Robots use neural vision to perceive their environment and symbolic reasoning to plan actions safely and logically. Climate and Sustainability Modeling: Processing raw environmental data with neural models, then applying symbolic reasoning to simulate scenarios and policy trade-offs. How Prosocial AI Can Bridge Divides Prosocial AI, systems designed to promote understanding and collaboration rather than maximizing mere engagement, represent an emerging business model with measurable advantages . Being aligned with sustainable development principles, they create more durable value propositions than systems optimized solely for efficiency metrics. The business logic is straightforward: Division creates costs, while understanding nurtures value. Organizations that implement AI systems promoting stakeholder alignment capture disproportionate returns in fragmented markets where competitors struggle with communication breakdowns and relationship management challenges. Market dynamics increasingly favor organizations that can demonstrate authentic commitment to stakeholder value creation. Prosocial AI provides a systematic approach to building and maintaining these relationships at scale. AI systems developed without explicit ethical frameworks tend to amplify polarization and create long-term stakeholder relationship challenges, while values-integrated systems generate sustainable engagement patterns. Beyond compliance requirements the integration of ethical principles into AI systems is a strategic decision. The UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics , adopted by 193 member states in 2021, established a framework that organizations can leverage for competitive advantage. Organizations implementing values-integrated AI architecture report several strategic benefits: Enhanced Trust Metrics: Stakeholders demonstrate increased willingness to engage with and invest in systems they perceive as fair and transparent. Regulatory Efficiency: Values-aligned systems face fewer compliance challenges and regulatory scrutiny. Talent Attraction: Ethical AI initiatives attract higher-quality partnerships, employees, and investment relationships. Crisis Resilience: Organizations with values-integrated systems demonstrate greater stability during reputation challenges. Anyone can use AI as a mindset translator to work more effectively across different perspectives. The Four T Method: How to Implement AI to Improve Communication The prosocial AI framework offers business leaders a practical implementation methodology based on four core principles: Tailored, Trained, Tested, and Targeted. But employees don\u2019t need to build AI systems to benefit from them. By tailoring inputs, training with context, testing for clarity, and targeting high-friction communication areas, anyone can use AI as a mindset translator to work more effectively across different perspectives. Tailored Systematically assess specific worldview translation challenges within organizational contexts. This includes mapping communication patterns between different stakeholder groups, identifying recurring translation failures, and designing customized protocols for specific cultural or professional divides.
