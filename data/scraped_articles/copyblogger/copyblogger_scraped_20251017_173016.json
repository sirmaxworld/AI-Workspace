      "content_text": "There are plenty of personal branding tips, like: \u201cPost five times per day\u201d \u201cPost more video content\u201d \u201cPost at 8:27AM PST!\u201d However, I haven\u2019t seen any recent to support many of these claims. Until now. I analyzed 100 LinkedIn influencers as well as each influencer\u2019s three top performing posts (for a total of 300 posts) to answer questions like: How often do top creators post? How many top performing posts are reposts? What are the top performing types of posts (image, video, carousels, etc.)? In this post, I\u2019ll share what I learned from this data and how you can use it to grow on LinkedIn. Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1? Our Academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. That means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. It was already the best place on the internet to learn content, copywriting, and online sales. Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 About The Data Used To Develop These LinkedIn Personal Branding Stats First, I acknowledge that 100 LinkedIn profiles and the top three performing posts (for a total of 300 posts) is a very small sample of data. Unfortunately, LinkedIn has strict limits, making it difficult to scrape a larger sample size. However, even a small sample of data allows you to see dominant trends. Therefore, this data isn\u2019t designed to deliver hard and fast rules. Instead, it shed light on several trends that can help you improve your LinkedIn personal branding strategy. As for the data itself, we only analyzed LinkedIn profiles who: Earn at least an average of 40 comments per post Post at least 30 times in the past six months Have less than 500,000 followers The minimum requirement of 30 posts in the last six months and less than 500,000 followers helped us eliminate \u201cbusiness celebrities\u201d (i.e., well-known entrepreneurs/executives with thriving personal brands outside of LinkedIn). These requirements allow the data to illuminate tactics and strategies anyone can use to grow on LinkedIn. For example, Sam Altman could post anything on LinkedIn, and the post would receive high engagement simply because of his brand outside of LinkedIn. Yet if you copied his exact post format, style, and tone, it probably wouldn\u2019t perform as well simply because he already has a wider network than the average entrepreneur or professional. I also looked at the three top performing posts from each influencer. We defined \u201ctop performing\u201d as the posts with the most engagement in the past six months and ultimately collected a data set of 300 posts. To collect all of this data, we used the Chrome Plugin Creator Match and manually entered the data from each LinkedIn influencer into a spreadsheet. 1.) 91% of LinkedIn creators post at least once every three days. There\u2019s no question that posting frequency is critical. 91% of the LinkedIn creators post at least once every three days. 72% of LinkedIn creators post at least once every two days. 20% of LinkedIn creators post at least once per day. As mentioned in the data collection method, I only included LinkedIn influencers who had posted at least 30 times within the last 180 days to prevent including \u201cbusiness celebrities\u201d (i.e., people who already had a brand and would, therefore, generate engagement regardless of their LinkedIn savviness.) However, I was surprised to see that ALL people we included in the study (influencers with a minimum average comment per post of at least 40 and fewer than 500,000 followers) posted at least once every five days. To be precise, only two of the 100 influencers randomly selected for this study posted less frequently than once every four days. The main takeaway from this statistic is that posting frequently is critical to LinkedIn personal branding success. Many people agonize over content quality and spend too much time crafting the perfect post when you\u2019d see a better ROI if you frequently post the best content you can produce in a limited time. So yes, spending hours, days, or weeks on an outstanding piece of evergreen content for a channel like SEO or YouTube might make sense, but for LinkedIn, the key to success is posting frequently. TL;DR: Just start posting! And post more often! 2.) Over half of the content posted (59%) was image based. We looked at all of the LinkedIn posts from the 100 influencers included in the study, and the data set ultimately consisted of 12,184 posts. Images were by far the most popular, as more than half (59%) of posts were image based posts. Here\u2019s the full breakdown of post types (note that numbers were rounded): Text based posts made up 12% of the total Video posts made up 11% of the total Carousel posts made up 17% of the total Image posts made up 59% of the total Polls made up >1% of the total Newsletters made up 1% of the total I was surprised that most creators rely heavily on image based posts. Plenty of Linkedin creators encourage video and carousel posts as they may produce higher engagement, yet image posts are the bread and butter for most creators. I assume this is because, as referenced by the first point, posting frequency is king. As carousels and videos take more time to create, image based posts are the bread and butter for most creators\u2019 strategy. Takeaway #3: 67% of the top performing posts were image posts After seeing that most of the top performing posts were image based, I was curious to see what type of post performed the best. So we looked at the top three highest-performing posts (defined by \u201chighest engagement\u201d \u2013 a combination of the most comments, likes, and shares) from each creator in the past 180 days. From this pool of 300 top performing posts, we found that image based posts were still the top performers: 16% were carousel posts 67% were image posts 9% were text posts 8% were video posts Again, I was a little surprised by this data at first. I assumed that videos and carousels would be more engaging, and therefore, even if creators didn\u2019t post them as often, they would still be the top performers. However, there are several other reasons why image based posts still proved to be the top performers: The ROI On Luck: Of course, if you have more text based content, there\u2019s a greater chance that one of them will take off. But I think these next factors have more of an impact. Content Substance Trumps Content Medium : It\u2019s easy to fixate on the content medium rather than the substance of the content itself. But if you just cured cancer and explained how you did it, that content would perform well, regardless of whether you chose to make a video, a carousel, a graphic, or a text-based post. Focus on improving the substance of your content rather than fixating on hacks or mediums. Instant Comprehension : A graphic can display a concept more instantaneously, whereas videos and even carousels require more time for people to get into the content and \u201cget the point.\u201d Especially on social media, instant comprehension is critical for comprehension. If you\u2019re curious to see how the top performing posts compared to the total posts, here\u2019s a breakdown: Takeaway #4: 16% of the posts that had an image or video were not original Many people don\u2019t post on LinkedIn because they don\u2019t want to hire a designer or create their own videos. However, it turns out that you don\u2019t need to create unique graphics or videos. The data shows that 16% of the top performing image and video posts were graphics or videos that the creator borrowed (with permission) from another creator. Here\u2019s a great example of how Reno Perry used (and then credited) a graphic from another creator to make his post more engaging: In some cases, you can even piggyback off someone else\u2019s entire idea and creative (as long as you credit them). Here\u2019 s a great example of this strategy from Kyle Poyar: We already established that publishing frequency is one of the most important indicators of success on LinkedIn, so if you\u2019re in a pinch and need to come up with something quickly, consider borrowing another creator\u2019s graphic or video and give them credit. Many of these creators actually appreciate that you share their content, and it can be a great way to build more relationships. Takeaway #5: 37% of the top performing image based posts were professionally designed graphics I expected most of the top performing image posts to be high quality, professionally designed graphics, though I found that most of them were just cell phone pictures of the creator. For example, this was the image for one of this creator\u2019s top performing posts. Remember that LinkedIn is first and foremost a social media platform, so posting life updates and including pictures of yourself is a great way to increase engagement. That said, the quality of engagement might be higher if you post graphics illustrating blueprints or tips as that will attract your ideal audience, though personal photos can also help build trust with your audience. Takeaway #6: 17% of the top performing posts were reposts When I started combing through the data, I realized many of the three top performing posts were reposts. Here\u2019s an example: Therefore, I excluded any reposts from the main data set of 300 posts for the sake of analyzing what makes a post an outlier, but we later went back and looked at just how many of the top three posts for any given creator were reposts. And the answer was 17%. The takeaway is to periodically repost each of your top performing posts. In fact, the reposted content often outperformed the original version. This may be because the creator had more followers when the reposted version was published. However, it still shows that most of your followers may not see (or remember) your content, so there\u2019s a significant benefit in reposting your old content. Here\u2019s a full breakdown of the repost statistics: 17% of the top performing posts were reposts A repost was among the top 3 performing",

      "content_text": "Most LinkedIn post templates offer frameworks, like: What\u2019s a failure story and what did you learn? What\u2019s your blueprint for (specific process)? What are your top three tips for (specific pain point)? These frameworks are still effective, but I still find them limiting for a few reasons: They aren\u2019t the only frameworks that work \u2013 and they often cater to a professional (and somewhat generic) tone of voice. The success of the post still depends on the topic of content you place in that framework. Frameworks are great, but you still have to come up with your own creative hook. To solve these problems, we studied the top performing posts of 50 LinkedIn influencers and broke down each of their posts into LinkedIn post templates. I\u2019ll also explain why I think the LinkedIn post performed so well (e.g., was there something unique about the topic selected?) and what you can learn about that topic. Therefore, these post templates not only give you very specific hook and copywriting ideas, but they also hopefully inspire you to look beyond the most commonly mentioned LinkedIn post frameworks. 50 LinkedIn Post Templates Template #1: Reno Perry This is an image and text based post that likely performed well because of the message in the image.

Template #2: Colby Kultger The \u201cX Skills for Y\u201d framework is fairly common, but this LinkedIn post likely earned a lot of engagement simply because it was framed with a quote that resonates with a wide audience. If you target a wider audience, you have a much higher chance of increasing engagement, though keep in mind that not all engagement is equally valuable. If your goal is to earn the attention of CMOs and convince them that you\u2019re the authority they need to work with, this post probably isn\u2019t the best post to accomplish that goal.

      "content_text": "A few years ago, I had no network and zero followers. But through years of trial and error posting, networking, and selling on social media, I figured the game out. That has led to having over 300,000 followers across all platforms and earning at least $1,000 every day. I\u2019ve also helped my ghostwriting and coaching clients gain over 1,000,000 followers and earn millions of dollars with better strategy. I say this not to brag, but to prove that anyone can build a personal brand from scratch. You don\u2019t need any special skills. You just need to execute the strategy I will lay out below and stay consistent. I\u2019ve spent years perfecting my approach. You won\u2019t receive results overnight, but if you keep at it, this is the blueprint to help you build a personal brand. Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1? Our Academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. That means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. It was already the best place on the internet to learn content, copywriting, and online sales. Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 #1: Niche Selection The difference between a personal brand and a typical social media account is that a personal brand establishes you as an expert on a topic rather than a generally popular person. Monetizing your following will be much easier if you\u2019re considered an expert in a particular subject. It\u2019s also easier to earn followers if you specialize in a niche, because they\u2019ll be attracted to you due to a similar interest. There are three key points to consider when selecting a niche: Earning potential Interest Expertise Earning Potential A higher follower count doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with more revenue. For example, one of my clients built a following of about 500,000 people around the topic of emo music. The only problem is that most of these followers were high school students with no money to spend. Despite the size of this audience, it wasn\u2019t very profitable. In contrast, if you can solve a problem for a small group of people who have the desire and means to spend a lot of money to solve that problem, you can generate plenty of revenue with just a few thousand followers. To determine the earning potential of a particular niche, ask yourself two questions: What\u2019s the problem I\u2019m solving? Who am I solving this problem for? How much is it worth it to this audience to solve that problem? My niche is personal branding, and here\u2019s how I answer each of those three questions: What\u2019s the problem I\u2019m solving : Building a monetizable audience. Who I\u2019m serving : High net worth entrepreneurs. How much is it worth for high net worth entrepreneurs to build a personal brand? In many cases, millions of dollars because they can use their personal brand for customer acquisition for their businesses. By answering these questions, you\u2019ll also identify your unique angle. Every good niche has some competition, so the key to standing out is niching down to solve one specific problem for a specific person. My unique angle is building personal brands for high net worth entrepreneurs. By establishing myself as an expert for those particular people, I\u2019m a much more attractive option to them than a generic personal branding expert. Interest You\u2019ll likely give up if you aren\u2019t passionate about the niche you select. Remember that this niche is a topic you\u2019ll write about almost daily, and your product or service will also be tied to it. I love marketing, so it was a no-brainer for me to build a personal brand around marketing. Expertise Expertise can help, though take this with a grain of salt. You don\u2019t need to have years of experience in the niche. Even if you spend three months learning about the topic, you\u2019ll probably know more than most people. Additionally, some of the best content is explaining experiments you\u2019re running, and you don\u2019t need any prior expertise to talk about what you\u2019re currently learning. #2: Create a Professional Brand Identity A messy professional profile cheapens your credibility, and a prospect who originally resonated with your content may be skeptical if they see mismatched colors and fonts across your website and social media profiles. You need to pay thousands of dollars for someone to build a beautiful branded profile, but you should do two basic things: Use consistent fonts Use consistent branded colors For example, if you look at my LinkedIn profile, you\u2019ll see that I use the same red and black color scheme and consistent font styles: The same is true for my website: The good news is that this is pretty simple. You can use a free tool like Canva to create your branded LinkedIn banner: I also recommend getting a high quality headshot of yourself. Again, you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money designing your profile \u2013 it just needs to be professional enough that it doesn\u2019t turn away interested prospects. After designing your profile, write a bio that accomplishes two goals: Communicate what you do Communicate who you serve Builds trust (ideally using proof like case studies) Here\u2019s my bio: \u201cPersonal brand builder. 1M followers gained and $10 million made for CEO clients. Now I\u2019m helping regular people do the same.\u201d One of the mistakes I often see people make is getting too fancy with their bios. If potential clients don\u2019t immediately understand what you offer or the type of content you create, you\u2019re missing out on the opportunity to earn followers and potential customers. #3: Content Creation It doesn\u2019t matter how well you execute the other steps of the personal branding process if your content doesn\u2019t resonate with your audience. Frameworks are a simple solution to efficiently create content that has already proven to perform well on social media platforms. Frameworks also prevent writer\u2019s block. In fact, I only spend about 10 minutes per day on content creation. First, any post that I create should fulfill at least one of two objectives: Evokes an emotional response Obviously and immediately useful Some excellent frameworks that fall under the emotional response category include: Personal failure story (a failure your clients probably experience) Personal experience (I did X and here\u2019s what happened) Contrarian take (Most people say X. I believe Y because of Z) Past vs Present (Here\u2019s what it used to be like. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like now. You\u2019ll get there) Here are a few frameworks that fall under the obviously and immediately useful category: A list of tools you use to do X (X being the thing your clients want) How I achieved X results X Tips to Achieve Y (Y being the result your clients want) X Mistakes That Cost Me Y X Examples of (Success) These frameworks can help you start creating content. In the beginning, expect that your content will be semi-generic. As you gain experience, develop your own perspectives. Your fresh viewpoints will make your content more interesting and help you gain more followers. Even if you\u2019re just starting out, injecting your personal experiences and lessons learned will help you develop that unique voice. #4: Content Publishing/Repurposing I used to agree with the traditional advice of choosing just one social platform and focusing entirely on it before moving to another platform. However, it takes a long time to grow on each platform. In my experience, clients have a much faster overall growth trajectory if they repurpose content from Day 1. The good news is that content repurposing is quite simple. I only spend about 10 minutes per day creating content and then a few extra minutes publishing it. Here\u2019s what my content repurposing system looks like: Here are some more details on the process: Step 1: Create a Tweet I prefer to start on X as it helps me stage my content. I haven\u2019t focused very heavily on X, as the algorithmic changes have made it less appealing than LinkedIn. But it\u2019s still a great place for me to get my thoughts down. Step 2: Repurpose Across Other Social Platforms I use a tool called Tweetpic to take a screenshot of my X post and then repurpose it across Instagram, Pinterest, Threads, and LinkedIn. Long form Tweets are turned into carousels on LinkedIn and Instagram. I also follow best practices for publishing on each platform. Here are just a few best practices: LinkedIn : Write a catchy hook and unique copy to accompany the Tweetpic. Here\u2019s an example of a post where I wrote unique copy to go along with the Tweet: Instagram: I treat Instagram similarly to LinkedIn \u2013\u00a0I write unique copy to go along with the Tweet and use relevant hashtags. Pinterest : I don\u2019t do keyword research per se, but I intuitively guess the best keyword for my post and then include that in the title. If there\u2019s a blog post that goes along with my Pin, I\u2019ll also link to the blog post. Threads : I just copy and paste my Tweets directly to threads without any modifications. Finally, I pick one long form, educational Tweet per week and turn it into a blog post on my website. I never turn emotion-evoking Tweets into blog posts because people searching Google are looking for educational content. If you turn long form emotional content into a blog post, it probably won\u2019t match a frequently searched keyword. Unfortunately, if the blog post doesn\u2019t align with a frequently searched keyword, Google won\u2019t show it as a result to searchers. So, regardless of how interesting your blog post is, it won\u2019t appear in Google search results and, therefore, won\u2019t attract new visitors and aid follower growth. We have a separate resource on SEO (search engine optimization), so I won\u2019t get into too many details here, but the most important thing is identifying a specific keyword to target and including it in the title of your post and several times throughout the article. Here are just a few of the blog posts I\u2019ve written, and you can see that each one aligns with a keyword, like: \u201cChatGPT prompts\u201d \u201cContent ideas\u201d \u201c",

      "content_text": "LinkedIn is one of the best platforms to find high paying B2B clients, but few people leverage it to its full potential. Simply messaging people on the platform, publishing an occasional post, or sporadically commenting on others\u2019 posts isn\u2019t an effective strategy to get clients on LinkedIn. So if you\u2019ve tried any of these methods without success, this guide will help you understand how to leverage the platform more effectively so that clients come to you rather than constantly chasing new opportunities. I have personally built a seven figure career on LinkedIn, and this is the exact process I used. Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1? Our Academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. That means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. It was already the best place on the internet to learn content, copywriting, and online sales. Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 Should I Cold Pitch Clients On LinkedIn? I\u2019m a big fan of doing conversational cold outreach on LinkedIn and other social platforms. The thing is, you need to do it correctly, and you likely won\u2019t get good results if you don\u2019t have a persuasive profile and some content published on it. If you want to maximize the results of cold outreach and start getting inbound leads too, I recommend building a personal brand on LinkedIn (i.e., building a following on LinkedIn). When you have a large following, potential customers will reach out to you for your services rather than you pitching new prospects. The downside of personal branding is that it takes a long time to build a following. Essentially, you\u2019re building relationships at scale, and great relationships take time to build. Yet over a long enough time horizon, here\u2019s the ROI of building a personal branding versus cold pitching: In short, yes, you can cold pitch potential clients on LinkedIn. However, don\u2019t rely on it as a long-term strategy, as creating content once and attracting clients organically is much more efficient. Therefore, I\u2019ll outline the exact strategy I use to help my coaching clients build a personal brand and get clients on LinkedIn. Step 1: Define Your ICP and Offer A common mistake many people make is offering a generic service to a generic customer. Here are a few examples of generic services: Ghostwriting SEO Career coaching Graphic design Instead, niche down and become the top expert for a particular service. Here are a few examples of more specialized services: LinkedIn ghostwriting Enterprise SEO Mobile graphic design While niching down limits your pool of potential customers, it also establishes you as an industry expert making you a more desirable candidate for a customer looking for that service. For example, someone looking to hire a ghostwriter to build their LinkedIn profile will likely hire a \u201cLinkedIn ghostwriter\u201d rather than a generic ghostwriter. In addition to refining your service offering, it\u2019s also important to refine your ideal customer profile (the person you\u2019re selling your service to). The ideal customer profile (ICP) is the title of the person who will buy your service and additional qualifiers, such as: Industry (e.g., health, marketing, finance, etc.) Company type (e.g., ecommerce, SaaS, coaching business) Company size (e.g., 11-50 employees) Here are some examples of ICPs for each of the following services: LinkedIn ghostwriting : Eight figure founders who have sold at least one business. SEO : The Director of SEO at an ecommerce company with at least 100 employees. Content marketing : The VP of Marketing at a SaaS company with at least 50 employees. Email marketing : The VP of Marketing at an ecommerce with at least 50 employees. Note : If you\u2019re selling a service, the person who will actually purchase your service is usually a decision maker at the company. For example, if you\u2019re selling a marketing service, the decision maker will likely be a VP, Director, or CMO. A decision maker would NOT be an associate or junior marketing manager. VPs and CMOs are excellent for companies with under 50 employees, and the Director of your service is often best for larger companies. As you\u2019re refining your ICP and offer, consider these three factors to maximize your income and happiness: Earning potential Interest Expertise Earning Potential Earning potential is determined by the value you deliver to the company. A misconception is that the value you bring to the table is tied directly to the quality of your work. However, value is also impacted by factors related to your ICP, such as their existing audience size, website traffic, and industry credibility. Therefore, you can typically charge larger, more established companies more money because they can leverage your services more effectively. Interest You\u2019re much more likely to stick with a service you enjoy executing. Consistency is a significant factor that determines long-term success, so pick something you genuinely enjoy. Expertise You don\u2019t necessarily need to be an expert, but it will help you close clients faster if you have some experience and case studies. Otherwise, you can gain experience by working for free. Step 2: Build a Compelling Professional LinkedIn Profile Creating a professional, branded profile immediately sets you apart from your competitors, and it only takes about an hour to execute. First, get a nice headshot. A professional headshot is best, but you can also dress up and ask a friend to take the picture with a phone. Next, select a color scheme and fonts. You can browse websites you like and then use a tool like WhatFont and ColorPick Eyedropper to find the exact colors/fonts they\u2019re using. Then, save the exact font names and colors in a doc so you don\u2019t lose them. Next, use a free tool like Photoroom and you can remove the background from your headshot and replace it with your new color scheme. The banner image should communicate two things: The value you offer. A proof point to prove that you can actually deliver on your promise. In my own banner, I communicate what I offer (a LinkedIn growth blueprint) and proof points in the form of client result screenshots. To design your banner, you can use a free tool like Canva . Your LinkedIn content will attract leads, but you won\u2019t actually close them on the LinkedIn platform. Instead, you\u2019ll sell them through email. Therefore, optimize your LinkedIn profile to capture as many emails as possible by using the tagline and CTA on your profile to direct them to your free lead magnet (we\u2019ll discuss how to create a lead magnet later). The banner image and tagline communicates what you do, but before people buy, they\u2019ll be more proof that you can deliver on your promise and that you\u2019ve helped other people just like them. In my bio, I lay out specific results I\u2019ve delivered for several different client personas. Then, introduce your audience to your paid service offer for those ready to take the next step. Step 3: Engage With Your ICP A key part of landing clients on LinkedIn is building real relationships with people, so create a list of people on LinkedIn who fit your ICP and consistently post on LinkedIn. For example, this person would be a great fit if you\u2019re offering influencer marketing services to companies with over 500 employees: However, check how often the person posts on LinkedIn. If they aren\u2019t active on LinkedIn, there won\u2019t be any content to engage with, making it difficult to build a real relationship with them. You can see how often this person posts by scrolling down to the \u201cactivity\u201d section in their profile: Once you have a list of people who fit your ICP and post consistently, save their LinkedIn URLs in a Google Sheet. Then, check that sheet two or three times per week and engage with the content they post. The best way to provide value to someone posting content is engaging with their content, so commenting on your ICP\u2019s post is an easy way to start building a positive relationship with them. In addition to commenting on your ICP\u2019s post, it\u2019s also a good idea to engage with industry leaders and build relationships with them. These relationships can lead to speaking opportunities, content collaborations, and other opportunities that will help you establish yourself as a thought leader. For example, if you offer content marketing services, this person would be an ideal individual to engage with and follow: You can also find other thought leaders by looking at the people who are commenting on their posts. Once you have a list of people to engage with, block off 15-20 minutes in your calendar each day to engage with them. Step 4: Content Creation People won\u2019t magically find your LinkedIn profile \u2013 you have to post content to appear in your ICP\u2019s newsfeed. LinkedIn content is an entire topic on its own, but the 80/20 comes down to these three factors: Creating content that\u2019s relevant to your audience\u2019s pain points Packaging the information in formats proven to capture attention on LinkedIn Maintaining a consistent publishing schedule To ensure you\u2019re creating content that\u2019s relevant to your audience\u2019s pain points, write out the most common pain points your target audience typically experiences before reaching out to you. For example, if you offer SEO for SaaS businesses, some of the problems your ICP (e.g., a VP of Marketing) might feel include: The SEO drives traffic, but not demos The website isn\u2019t ranking anywhere for its main keywords Traffic has been steadily declining due to AI overviews If you don\u2019t know your ICP\u2019s pain points, ask them. These discussions will not only make your content more effective, but they will also help you tailor your services to be more effective. If you don\u2019t have any clients right now, another option is to look at your \u201ccompetitors\u201d top performing content (e.g., other people who offer the same services as you) and identify the pain points ",

Join Us For $1 Example #1: UGC From Manus You\u2019ve probably seen examples of UGC content and ads for ecommerce companies, but very few B2B or SaaS businesses have effectively leveraged UGC content. Manus is an exception. They have a handful of brand ambassadors posting on LinkedIn about why the product is a better alternative to other options and even screenshots and videos of how the tool works. Here\u2019s a great example where an influencer explains how to solve a specific pain point with the product: Source Here\u2019s a great example where an influencer explains why it\u2019s better than other alternatives: Source If you want to duplicate their success, look at your current list of customers and highlight those who happen to be influencers. If you\u2019re primarily using Instagram, you can use a tool like IGFollow to download the list of followers from the platform. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t show you the follower count, so you\u2019ll have to hire a VA to notate the follower count for each of your followers. If your business is B2B, use your CRM data to find the LinkedIn profiles of all your customers and then reach out to those with the most followers on LinkedIn. Next, reach out and ask those customers to create content for you. For DTC products, you can ask the customer to publish a post discussing how they use the product to solve a particular problem and how it\u2019s different from competing products. For B2B products, ask the customer to share how they use the product to solve a specific pain point (e.g., why are they paying for it?). You can also ask them to explain why they chose your product over other options. Example #2: Video Content From Ahrefs Most software companies struggle with video marketing for one of two reasons: Poor views/engagement: Often the content doesn\u2019t earn views because the selected topic isn\u2019t well suited for video, or the topic was poorly framed for YouTube. Plenty of views but no conversions: If you post an entertaining challenge video, it might earn views, but those views may not convert. This problem often occurs because the viewers the video attracts aren\u2019t the right audience (e.g., they\u2019re kids). Or it may be that the video simply doesn\u2019t show the product\u2019s value. Ahrefs is an exception. They have mastered video content as their videos check all of the following boxes: Well framed for YouTube : They fit an entertaining format that\u2019s proven to generate clicks on platforms like YouTube (like a challenge or game video) Attracts the ideal audience : The video topics still attract their ideal audience (SEO professionals) Shows the product as a solution : Whether it\u2019s a tutorial or challenge video, they always show how to solve a specific problem using Ahrefs. For example, check out the video \u201cI Tried to Rank #1 on Google in 24 Hours.\u201d You\u2019ll see that it fits all three of the criteria mentioned above. If you fast forward to about 9:20, you\u2019ll see that the presenter even mentions: \u201c So I wasted a bunch of time trying to do this manually and completely forgot that there\u2019s this report in Ahrefs called \u201cAlso Talk About\u201d which is showing us topics that the top 10 pages for blogging tips are talking about. \u201d Simply attracting the right customers to your video content isn\u2019t enough \u2013 show them how your product solves the pain points that arise in the video. I should also mention that not every video needs to fit a challenge or \u201cclickable\u201d format. If you sort by Ahrefs\u2019 most popular videos, they dominate with tutorials. Ahrefs\u2019 tutorial videos work because: They pick popular topics : Some topics require more visual demonstration and are therefore better suited for video than others. Before making a tutorial video, see if any other videos have high view counts for that topic. They deliver the content in simple language, with clear visual examples, and easy step by step actionable instructions . It may seem silly, but many tutorial videos fail because the concepts aren\u2019t verbally explained clearly and/or lack clear visual demonstration. Use examples, simple language, and make it easy to understand. Here\u2019s a great example of one of their videos: Example #3: Video Content From BPN BPN is a supplement company founded by YouTuber Nick Bare, and they created a separate YouTube channel for the BPN brand. They film \u201cday in the life\u201d videos on this channel featuring different athletes. The videos have been massively successful, with the most successful yet generating over 800,000 views in the first 8 months. BPN is an excellent of video content marketing example because: The videos follow a proven entertaining format (the \u201cday in the life\u201d format does well on YouTube). The videos attract BPN\u2019s target audience (hybrid athletes). The videos show the value of the product. The athlete\u2019s diet is a major segment that someone watching a \u201cday in the life\u201d video wants to know, so it\u2019s natural to pitch the BPN supplement and have the athlete explain why they use it. People watching this video probably want to be like the athlete, so buying the supplement is a no-brainer. So even if you have a DTC product, this is a great formula to create entertaining videos while also showing how your product solves a pain point. Example #4: Personal Branding From Carry Ankur Nagpal grew his personal brand on social media and then used his network to build his startup \u2013 Carry. In fact, he validated his startup idea with a single Tweet. If you want to build a personal brand to generate leads for your company, first select your niche. Ankur\u2019s company is in the personal finance industry, so he regularly writes about personal finance. He wasn\u2019t a personal finance expert when he first started writing about it, so he just shared what he was learning. Here\u2019s an example of a personal finance related post you might find in his feed: However, to help more people find his content, he also wrote about broader entrepreneurship topics. He also shares about his own personal life, which is fun, and makes him seem more personable, which can deepen your relationships with followers. If you\u2019re just getting started, keep the majority of your content relevant to your niche. However, still include some broader interest topics to generate awareness and a few personal posts so that people can get to know you. Even if you\u2019re an employee at a company, you can still build your own personal brand, or ask your executives to build their brands to drive more leads for the company. Personal branding may seem like an unorthodox form of content marketing, but it will help you build deep relationships with your audience, which can be more impactful than blog content from a faceless brand. Ankur\u2019s company, Carry, is proof of the power of personal branding. As mentioned in our marketing trends guide, there are plenty of AI tools to give \u201chow-to\u201d advice. Today, people care more about who the content is coming from. Example #5: Podcast Content From Hampton Plenty of companies have podcasts, but very few succeed. Hampton is an exception. It\u2019s a community of high net-worth entrepreneurs, and the community members are the main value of the membership. So rather than simply talking about \u201chow-to\u201d or trend related content, they feature the stories of their members. If listeners want to connect with the other members, it\u2019s a no-brainer to join Hampton. The podcast is also uniquely interesting for a few reasons: The people are unique : Many of the Hampton members are previously-unknown entrepreneurs that are worth eight, nine, and even ten figures. The angle is unique : Plenty of business podcasts discuss how to get rich, but no other podcast discusses what to do after making a lot of money (a pain point Hampton helps members solve). This podcast discusses what these entrepreneurs do with their wealth. The personal/transparency element : Instead of discussing how-to topics you could search on ChatGPT, each episode shares a person\u2019s unique story (which has usually never been told before). They get very personal and talk about how money has impacted their lives, relationships, and mental wellbeing. For example, this episode discusses an anonymous member who shared the story of how she navigated amassing incredible wealth through her business and navigated a divorce. Or this episode where they discussed the depression following a massive sale: So if you\u2019re thinking about starting a podcast for your brand, ask yourself these questions: Who? If you\u2019re doing a guest podcast, don\u2019t just interview the most popular industry experts. Interview under-the-radar people with interesting stories that have never been told. You can find these people at industry events and through your network. What\u2019s the angle? People want to be entertained or inspired, even if it\u2019s a B2B podcast. Sam makes it entertaining through compelling storytelling by asking guests personal/deep questions and even sensitive money stats. How can we make it entertaining? Even if it\u2019s a B2B podcast, people want to be entertained or inspired. Sam does this by asking guests personal/rar",

      "content_text": "Even if you\u2019re the very best coach in the world, you won\u2019t get clients if potential clients who want your solution: Don\u2019t know you exist Don\u2019t realize (or believe) that you can deliver value to them Don\u2019t know how to contact you These are the reasons potential clients aren\u2019t reaching out to you right now. The good news is that if you can solve each of those problems, you\u2019ll get coaching clients. In this post, we\u2019ll demystify the process of acquiring coaching clients. You\u2019ll learn how to connect with your ideal clients, build a relationship with them, and provide value that\u2019s so helpful they reach out to you for coaching services. Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1? Our Academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. That means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. It was already the best place on the internet to learn content, copywriting, and online sales. Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 Step 1: Define Who Is (And Is NOT) Your Ideal Coaching Client If you\u2019re going to have a doctor perform brain surgery on you, would you hire a brain surgeon or a general doctor? Even if the brain surgeon costs significantly more, you\u2019ll still probably select the brain surgeon. Why? You assume that because they\u2019re a specialist in your problems, they\u2019ll probably do a better job. The same is true for coaching. Coaching clients want to hire specialists, not generalists. Therefore, the first step is becoming very clear about the specific problems you solve and the type of person you help. Start by defining two things: The Problem : What specific pain or challenge do your clients have that you can solve? For example, instead of offering \u201ccareer coaching,\u201d maybe you specialize in helping mid-level managers break into executive roles. The Person : Who specifically has this problem? What\u2019s their career stage, income level, or demographic? A fitness coach for \u201cbusy moms in their 40s\u201d will land clients much faster than a coach for \u201canyone who wants to get healthier.\u201d Think about qualifying characteristics (busy), titles (moms, mid-level managers, etc.), and demographics (age, male/female, etc.). A pro tip is to adjust your services to only sell to people with the means to pay. You can help college students with stress management, but if they can\u2019t afford your service, you won\u2019t have a viable business. Once you\u2019ve identified who you sell to, create an anti-client list. This is a written list of people you do not work with, and it will help you repel those who do not fit your ideal customer profile. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a business coach for early-stage SaaS founders: Ideal client : Founders with $1M ARR who need help building a sales pipeline. Anti-client : Hobbyists tinkering with an idea, or founders who haven\u2019t validated their product yet. A common objection is, \u201cWell, I currently don\u2019t have any clients, so I\u2019m willing to work with anyone!\u201d However, by offering to work with anyone, you\u2019ll be classified as a generalist, and it will be harder to attract your ideal clients and charge premium prices in the long run. Also, only offer coaching services for things you\u2019ve actually done yourself. For example, don\u2019t try to be an executive coach if you\u2019ve never held an executive position. Similarly, if you\u2019re not in great shape, don\u2019t try to be a fitness coach. As you\u2019ll soon see, having experience will be crucial when pitching clients and creating marketing materials. Step 2: Close Your First Coaching Client A key mistake most coaches make is building a website, creating social media accounts, and engaging in other marketing activities before securing their first client. The problem with this approach is that effective marketing stems from sharing the experiences and results you\u2019ve already achieved for other clients. Sharing your own experience is great, but most people will want to see that your success wasn\u2019t a fluke and that you can duplicate the results for future clients. To borrow from Alex Hormozi, there are only four ways to get customers : Warm Outreach Cold Outreach Paid Ads Content He recommends getting leads in that order, and in my own experience, this is good advice. To get started, do warm outreach. This means reaching out to people who already know you. If you\u2019re unsure where to start, review all the people you\u2019re connected with on social media and all the contacts in your phone. You\u2019ll probably feel awkward asking if you can coach them, so instead ask if they know of anyone who might be interested in your coaching services. Let them know that you\u2019re willing to do it for free to earn testimonials and case studies. Here\u2019s a sample message you could send: Hi (name), How is (recent thing you know that\u2019s happened in their life)? I\u2019ve been exploring the idea of offering (type) coaching services and want to get some experience to see if it\u2019s something I really want to pursue. Do you know of anyone who might be interested in letting me coach them for free in exchange for a testimonial? However, you might not have any friends who fit your ideal customer description. For example, you might want to offer career coaching but none of your friends are looking for a job. In that case, consider doing cold outreach. For example, you could browse through all the people on LinkedIn with an \u201cOpen to Work\u201d badge and offer to review their resume and send over a few job openings. Here\u2019s an example: Hi (name), I saw you\u2019re currently open to work. I found these jobs that might be a good fit. I\u2019d also be happy to optimize your resume. I\u2019m starting career coaching on the side and want to get a few testimonials. Would you be open to letting me coach you for free in exchange for a testimonial if I help you get a job? I\u2019ll send you a few action items per day, along with relevant job postings. This cold email works well because: The person we\u2019re targeting is clearly looking for work (they have an open-to-work badge). It offers something that\u2019s valuable and done-for-them. (\u201cHere are some jobs, happy to look at your resume.\u201d) It makes a \u201cfree in exchange for testimonial if you achieve the dream outcome\u201d offer. It tells them exactly what you\u2019ll do for them (send you action items and send relevant job posts). Once you have a few clients, ask them for testimonials and write out the systems and processes you\u2019ve developed that have been most effective. Step 3: Create a Place to Capture Leads Now that you have some revenue and you\u2019ve produced some results for clients, you can start to scale your coaching business so that you aren\u2019t constantly relying on referrals. To do this, start by creating a social media account that clearly communicates: Who you are (Are you actually credible and what have you done?) What you offer (What you do and don\u2019t do) Who you help (who is your typical client) Past results/credibility (Have you helped other people just like them achieve these goals?) Most people build a website to communicate this information. However, I prefer coaches to start with a simple social media account for a few reasons: Setting up social media accounts is easier and faster . Your audience is already active on social media. Social media is designed for sharing tips and showing a more personal side of yourself, which is excellent for building trust. The key is setting up an account on the right social media platform. The primary social platforms most suitable for coaches are typically LinkedIn, X, or Instagram. As you grow, YouTube is also very powerful, though it might be too intimidating if you\u2019re just getting started. I\u2019ll focus primarily on LinkedIn and X in this post, because: LinkedIn is the obvious choice for career coaches, executive coaches, and leadership coaches. Even for fitness, health, and lifestyle coaches, LinkedIn and X tend to attract a higher-paying demographic. Dan Go is an excellent example of a health and fitness coach who has built a strong personal brand on LinkedIn. There are essentially two steps to optimize your LinkedIn or X profile: The branding (colors, graphics, etc.) The content (bio, tagline, etc.) We\u2019ll discuss each below. The Branding Creating an aesthetically pleasing banner image and profile picture is relatively easy, and doing so immediately helps you stand out as a true professional. You can use a template from Canva to create your LinkedIn banner image: Then, select a color palette and font to use across all of your future content (website, social content, etc.). For example, my business partner Charles uses the same font and color patterns across his banner, profile picture, and website. Even his LinkedIn carousels use the same branding: You can simply choose a LinkedIn banner template and then notate in a document the color palettes and fonts you used: The Content The next step is writing your tagline and bio. Most people simply write a generic title, such as \u201cExecutive Coach.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t stand out and jump off the page to your ideal clients because it doesn\u2019t make it clear how you can help them . Your tagline, bio, and even your banner image should clearly tell people: What you offer Who you help Proof that you can deliver (You\u2019ll also pitch your lead magnet, which we\u2019ll create in the next step) Here\u2019s a great example of a well-optimized profile: Even the banner image reflects who this coach helps. The bio section should not only discuss who you are, but also how you assist your target audience. Specifically, here\u2019s a short checklist you can use when writing your bio: Paint your audience\u2019s dream outcome. Outline how you can help them achieve that dream outcome. Provide proof to back up how you\u2019ve helped other people just like them achieve that dream outcome. Here\u2019s Ahmad\u2019s bio section. He does an excellent job of painting the vision his ideal customer wants to achieve. The only recommendation I might add is including proof of past cl",

Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 1. Select Your Niche Some freelance writing niches pay significantly more than others, so picking a high paying niche can dramatically increase your earning potential. Two factors to consider as you\u2019re selecting your freelance writing niche are: The service The client Some of the most popular freelance writing platform/opportunities include: Social media : Social media ghostwriting for LinkedIn and X is an in-demand service. This is a great service if you enjoy short form content and are a great storyteller. Content marketing : Companies hire freelance writers to create blog posts to rank for specific keywords. If you want to be a content marketer, learn the basics of SEO, as most companies hiring content marketers care more about ranking for keywords than the content itself. Newsletter writer: Newsletter writing is a great niche if you enjoy research. Pick a subject you\u2019re passionate about as you\u2019ll need to stay on top of the latest news and trends.You can either ghostwrite a newsletter for an individual, or you can write for a newsletter company (like Morning Brew). Here\u2019s an example of a personal newsletter: Email copywriting : There are many types of email copywriting, from regular company updates to in-depth nurture sequences. Sales emails for products or courses tend to be the most profitable as it\u2019s worth it for a company to pay an extra few thousand dollars for an email copywriter who can increase conversions by even a small percentage. Video scriptwriting : YouTube is maturing as a legitimate marketing channel, and plenty of companies are hiring scriptwriters. Additionally, many YouTubers have turned their channels into legitimate businesses and are hiring scriptwriters to expedite the production process. Video scriptwriting is clearly an up-and-coming niche as one creator recently earned $70,000 launching a YouTube scriptwriting course. The next step to selecting your niche is choosing your dream client \u2013 both the industry and business. Pinpointing your dream client is important because your income as a freelance writer is not correlated with effort. Your earning potential is correlated with the value you deliver to clients. Keep in mind that: Value \u2260 Work Quality Value = Dollars Earned This concept is important to remember because the amount of money you generate for a client often varies on factors outside of your control, like: The profitability of their product Their audience size Their marketing funnel\u2019s optimization For example, a great email copywriter can charge $10,000 for a sales letter that generates $100,000 in profit for the business \u2013 even if they only spent three hours writing it. However, a brand new dropshipping business that sells a $5 product probably won\u2019t pay more than $100 for the same amount of work. This is because a new company has a small audience, and the price is so low that it likely generates little profit. As you\u2019re considering your dream client, ask: How much money will my results make for this person/business ? Here are some basic guidelines for identifying a mature client across a few different services: Social media : Entrepreneurs who have exited their business or are making eight figures per year. Blogging/content marketing : Businesses with a strong brand (at least 100k in monthly traffic.) that rely heavily on SEO for customer acquisition. Newsletter : Newsletters that already have large sponsors (you can subscribe and see how big the companies sponsoring them are), paid newsletters that have a large subscriber base, and newsletters in highly lucrative industries (think banking, etc.). Email writing : Course creators with a substantial, engaged following (several thousand people) and a high value course ($1,000 plus) or B2B companies that need nurture sequences for high value products are all excellent prospects. Video scriptwriting : You can target a major YouTuber or a large brand like HubSpot that\u2019s beginning to create videos for specific keywords. Finally, the industry should be a topic you\u2019re genuinely passionate about, as your passion will impact both your work quality and overall happiness as a freelance writer. For example, you can charge a lot to write a newsletter about mergers and acquisitions, but if you have no interest in the subject, you probably won\u2019t do as good of a job as someone who lives and breathes mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, you\u2019ll burn out if you don\u2019t enjoy the subject you\u2019re writing about, which will ultimately cause you to fail. So choosing a subject you love writing about really does impact how much money you\u2019ll ultimately earn. 2. Create a List of Your Dream Clients New freelance writers often make the mistake of targeting smaller clients when they first start because they fear their dream client won\u2019t want someone inexperienced. However, your dream clients don\u2019t really care about your experience \u2013 they want to hire a person who consistently delivers great work . In the next step, you\u2019ll prove that you\u2019re that A-tier freelancer by creating an amazing free sample for that client. If you create a stellar sample piece, most dream clients won\u2019t even ask about your experience. On the other hand, marketing budget is more precious for a smaller client, so they may ask more about your experience. The other factor that will impact your close rate (the percentage of clients that hire you) is whether or not the client is actively hiring for that service. If the company already has a team in place, they might not be interested in hiring another person, regardless of your quality of work. That box is already \u201cchecked\u201d on their to-do list. This is why you\u2019ll need to reach out to multiple companies. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t receive a reply on your first few tries. That said, if the company is actively hiring a full-time employee for the service you offer, that\u2019s a clear sign they need your service. To find companies hiring a full-time employee for your services, you can look at a job board like LinkedIn, Wellfound , or even Indeed. Companies hiring in-house talent for that position have already set aside a budget for the service you offer, and many of them are happy to consider freelancers rather than hiring in-house. You can also post on job boards like Upwork , but those tend to be much more competitive and it can be difficult to stand out. You can still reach out to companies that aren\u2019t actively hiring for the role, as they may need that service and just haven\u2019t gotten around to posting a job description. If you can access a tool like Crunchbase, look for companies that recently hired a new marketing leader (e.g., CMO, VP of Marketing, Marketing Director, etc.) or received more funding. New marketing leaders need to grow and will probably hire for new roles. Similarly, companies that recently received funding will likely deploy that capital into hiring new talent. 3. Create Free Sample Pieces \u201cBuild a writing portfolio.\u201d This is advice most people tell you. Instead, create free sample pieces for your dream clients. If your dream clients don\u2019t hire you, you can use these sample pieces to build a writing portfolio. So let\u2019s say you decided to offer content marketing services. You identified that your dream client is Influencity , an influencer marketing tool. Therefore, write a blog post on the topic of influencer marketing. This practice will make you a better writer, and it\u2019s a compelling pitch. 4. Pitch Your Dream Client These are the two most important principles when pitching clients: Find the right person to contact. Keep it short. First, the right person to contact is the person who has the authority to hire for that role. I use LinkedIn. The free version allows you to search by \u201cmarketing\u201d under the \u201cPeople\u201d tab: The best person to contact is usually the highest ranked marketing executive if it\u2019s a marketing team of five or fewer people. If it\u2019s a larger company with a marketing team of five or ten people, there\u2019s a good chance those executives receive too many pitches for yours to cut through the noise. In that case, pitch the content or social media marketing manager (depending on the service you\u2019re pitching). Once you find the right person, send them a connection request. If you see that they\u2019re active on LinkedIn, comment on some of their content. Next, find their email address. You can use a tool like Hunter.io or Verifalia to do this. Try a few different combinations like: (first)@domain.com (first).(last)@domain.com (firstinitial).(last)@domain.com (last)@domain.com One of those will probably work. Next, write your email. Keep it to just two lines. Here\u2019s the template Hi (name), (one line saying why they\u2019re your dream client) I\u2019d love to write (service) for (brand). I already wrote one for you (see attached). Tim Remember to attach your sample! Here\u2019s an example of how you could adjust this template for a real pitch: Hi Alex, It was love at first bite when I tried the peanut butter chocolate flavor \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019d love to write emails for SkinnyDipped. I already wrote one for you (see attached). Tim Don\u2019t be discouraged if they don\u2019t respond to your first email. Follow up with them at least twice. It might take a few tries, but you\u2019ll eventually land your first client and ",

Select One Service For One Industry/Avatar If you have an issue with your heart, you\u2019ll want to speak to a cardiologist \u2013 not a general doctor. Even if the cardiologist charges more, you\u2019ll probably go them rather than the general doctor. Why? A cardiologist is much more experienced with heart issues than a general doctor and can therefore give you better advice. You don\u2019t really want to make a gamble with your heart health. The same is true for great marketing agency clients. They don\u2019t want to make a gamble. They want to hire a true expert who understands their industry and has a proven solution for their problem. If you position yourself as a specialist in a particular subset of marketing, you\u2019re actually more likely to stand out to clients looking for the particular service you offer, and you can also charge more for your services. As your agency grows and you can hire more talented experts, you can expand to offer more services. However, pick just one service as you\u2019re getting started. Here are some examples of marketing agency services you can offer: Personal branding/social media ghostwriting SEO Content marketing Email marketing Social media content creation Influencer marketing Paid advertising For broader services, like \u201cinfluencer marketing\u201d or \u201cpaid advertising,\u201d you can get even more specific. For example, instead of specializing in influencer marketing, you could specialize in influencer marketing for Instagram. Secondly, pick just one industry/avatar to serve. Here are a few examples of very specific avatars: D2C companies in health and wellness B2B SaaS companies Entrepreneurs with companies worth $10 million plus Those examples are very specific. You could broaden your avatar a little (e.g., \u201cD2C companies with 10+ employees\u201d rather than D2C companies specifically in health and wellness). However, the more you match the characteristics of your prospects, the more compelling you\u2019ll appear to prospects because they\u2019ll believe that your system was designed specifically for their nuanced problems.

Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 2.) Build Case Studies The golden rule of building a marketing agency is this: Produce great results for clients . The good news is that this isn\u2019t too difficult \u2013 even for beginners. If you spend a few months studying and executing the service, you\u2019ll robably be better than about 90% of people. But there is one problem. If you have no experience, how do you get your first job to practice and build experience? Most people will turn you down even if you offer to work for free. It\u2019s too risky. What if you tank the marketing strategy? For example, you\u2019d probably prefer to pay an experienced surgeon for open heart surgery than accept a free open heart surgery from a college student with no experience. The good news is that there are a few different ways around this problem. 1. Offer to bring in world class mentorship. Let\u2019s say you want to offer SEO for ecommerce. You could go onto a platform like MentorPass, look at all of the Shopify SEO experts , and then pitch your target brands that you\u2019ll pay to take a call with one of those world-class experts to create and execute a strategy for their brand. From the brand\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re getting feedback from world-class experts and someone to execute it \u2013 all for free! Here\u2019s an example of pitch I sent: This strategy does require you to put some cash up for the initial coaching call, but you could work out a deal where the company pays for future coaching calls. And, assuming you do a great job, you\u2019ll probably close the new client. So it\u2019s more like a customer acquisition cost. Even if you don\u2019t close the brand you pitched, the mentor you work with might be impressed with your work and give you referrals for free. If nothing else, you\u2019ll learn a lot doing the coaching call and execution, and the call is still probably cheaper than a college course! 2. Sign up for an apprenticeship program. Acadium is a platform that matches new marketers with businesses that need services. For example, if you want to do SEO for ecommerce, you can sign up for Acadium and request to be matched with an ecommerce company that wants help with SEO. These businesses don\u2019t expect you to have a lot of experience and (unlike businesses you\u2019d be cold pitching) are willing to put in the time to train you. Each apprenticeship contract is 3 months and you\u2019ll be expected to dedicate about 10 hours per week to the project. 3. Send completed work. Instead of telling someone you\u2019ll do the work for free, just send them the completed work. This strategy doesn\u2019t work for every marketing service, but it does for some. Here\u2019s an example of how you could create free samples for a D2C store: Social media marketing: Create a sample instagram reel or post for the company. Video marketing: Create a free YouTube video featuring their product. SEO: Create a blog post targeting a keyword that\u2019s critical to them. Copywriting: Write/adjust a sales page for their product. \u201c What if they don\u2019t post/use my work ?\u201d First, you can always just tweak the sample and send it to their competitors. If you don\u2019t get a response to your first cold pitch to competitors, you can even send a follow up asking them to at least give you a \u201cno\u201d as you\u2019ll send it to their competitor (but mention you would really like to work with them). Even if their competitors don\u2019t accept the work, you\u2019ll have gained excellent experience and will have developed systems and processes that you can use to pitch future clients. You can also add it to your portfolio. 4. Do the marketing for yourself. My favorite strategy is simply doing the work for yourself and using it as a case study. I love this method because it allows you to experiment and find what does and does not work. You can also post about your experiences on social media, which will help you build an audience and make valuable connections. For example, if you want to offer SEO services, start a website in any niche and document the process of growing it. I realize that paid ads might not be feasible if you don\u2019t have any money to spend making the case study. However, services like content marketing, ghostwriting, SEO, design, and web development are all easy for you to start doing for yourself today. 3.) Get Your First Paying Customer Now that you have a few case studies and glowing reviews from people you worked with for free, closing your first paying customer will be much easier. Here are some of the best ways to get your first marketing agency customers in 2025. Partnerships Partnerships have been one of my most profitable client acquisition strategies. Many larger agencies only deal with clients with an enterprise budget, and you can work out a referral deal where they give you some of their lower budget prospects. I don\u2019t recommend pricing your services cheap , but you can position yourself as a premium provider for smaller companies that can\u2019t realistically afford some of the larger agencies. Alternatively, you could partner with some of the smaller agencies that have parallel specialties. For example, if you specialize in YouTube influencer marketing, you could partner with an agency that specializes in Instagram influencer marketing. This expands their service capabilities, making it a win-win. B2B Influencers Once you\u2019re confident in your capabilities, consider reaching out to some B2B influencers (LinkedIn/X) and ask if you can do some work for them for free. If they like the work, offer to pay them to write a post about your services. For example, Andrew Wilkinson occasionally promotes other companies on his Twitter account: To make B2B influencer promotions work, your services must be truly outstanding. Otherwise, the influencer probably won\u2019t agree to promote it, and you could get a negative reputation before you even really get started. Ask For Referrals If you\u2019ve already worked for someone for free building case studies, ask if they have friends looking for the same service. If you\u2019ve done a great job for them, they\u2019ll likely be more than happy to help. Now, many people say they\u2019ve tried asking for referrals, and it hasn\u2019t resulted in any new business. Referral strategies fail if the asker (you) puts the work on the other person (your client) to make the referral. Instead, do the work for them by writing out the text for a LinkedIn or Twitter post they can immediately publish. You could also write out a list of ideal prospects who you know they know and ask if they\u2019ll make the intro to those specific people. If you just ask, \u201cCan you give me a referral?\u201d they\u2019ll probably agree, but won\u2019t do anything. They won\u2019t want to take the time to think of who might want your services or what to write on social media. Do some cold outreach Cold outreach still works if you do it correctly. These are the three core ingredients to cold email success: Demand : The company must fit your avatar and be looking for a service provider who offers what you offer. Person : You must reach out to the right person (i.e., the person with the power to hire for that position.) Pitch : A short, compelling pitch with proof you can deliver what they need. These three ingredients may seem simple, but they\u2019re remarkably difficult to achieve. The first pillar (demand) is particularly challenging. Even if the company fits your ideal custo",

      "content_text": "Can you really make money as a copywriter today? With AI content writers, making money as a copywriter might seem unlikely \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t have any experience. But there are still plenty of copywriters making six and even seven figures. Even a quick glance at platforms like Upwork proves that plenty of companies still pay over $100 per hour for expert-level copywriters. The biggest difference today is that copywriters must be excellent at the ideation aspect of copywriting. The highest paid copywriters aren\u2019t just stringing words together. First, they identify the problems readers face. Then, they find and/or curate unique data, examples, and insights that illuminate exactly what readers need to do to overcome those challenges. In this post, I\u2019ll outline exactly how you can become a highly paid copywriter in a matter of weeks. Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1?

Most people think about how much you can make as a freelance copywriter. Though freelancing is just the first step in the game. After earning some money as a freelance copywriter, you can use your copywriting skills to build a personal brand and, eventually, a business. Here\u2019s a more detailed look at the different levels of scale you can achieve by becoming a copywriter. Level 1: Freelance Copywriting The first level of making money as a copywriter is freelancing, though the specific niche you select significantly impacts your earning potential. I asked ChatGPT to summarize the average earning potential as a freelance copywriter for various niches, and here\u2019s the data provided: The good news about freelance copywriting is that you can start making money relatively quickly. If you follow the step by step instructions in this post, you should be able to start earning money within a matter of weeks. Level 2: Influential Personal Brand As you\u2019re freelance writing, use your writing skills to start building your personal brand. Growing a following on LinkedIn or X can take some time, but once you build momentum, there are plenty of ways to earn additional income from your writing by promoting products to your new audience. First, you can earn money as an affiliate marketer by promoting other products to your growing audience and earning a commission on anything your audience purchases. You can also become an influencer marketer, where brands pay you to promote their products or services. It takes years to build a following where you\u2019re earning a substantial amount from brand deals, but brands are often willing to pay the right creator anywhere from $500 to $2,000 per post: Here\u2019s a quote from Ahrefs\u2019 influencer marketer regarding their typical budget for influencer marketing: Level 3: Solopreneur Promoting other products and services is a great way to make extra money for minimal additional effort, but a much higher leverage opportunity is offering your own products and services to your audience. Here are just a few examples of solopreneurs who are earning over $1 million per year \u2013 and they all grew through their followings on LinkedIn and/or X: My business partner, Charles Miller, built a following across LinkedIn and X and has made over seven figures providing courses, coaching, and LinkedIn content services to my audience. You can learn more about the course and community we run together, Copyblogger Academy , that helps copy creators build and monetize an audience on LinkedIn. I share this to show you that freelance copywriting isn\u2019t the only way to make money. You can start with freelance writing to quickly earn cash and then use your copywriting skills to build your own audience and either scale it into a marketing agency or offer your own products. How To Make Money As a Copywriter I know plenty of companies still hiring freelance copywriters, and this is the step-by-step process you can use to land your first client in just a few weeks \u2013 even if you have no prior experience. Step 1: Identify Your Niche Great employers hire specialists. For example, if you\u2019re a SaaS company hiring a SaaS content writer, which of these profiles would you choose? If you\u2019re like most SaaS content marketers, you\u2019d probably choose the SaaS content writer over the generic freelance writer. So pick one niche and make yourself the definitive expert in that particular niche. Here are a few examples of niches you could select to establish yourself as a specialist in: LinkedIn ghostwriting Blog writing Sales page copywriting Email copywriting Even within each category, you can niche down even further to specialize in creating content for a specific avatar or industry. For example, you could specialize in writing for: DTC companies SaaS companies Coaches AI companies If you\u2019re having trouble choosing just one, remember that you can always expand and add services after you\u2019ve built a customer base. For example, you can start with blog writing for SaaS companies and then expand to also offer email marketing. Yet if your initial positioning is too generic, you\u2019ll likely find getting your first few clients difficult. Step 2: Create A Piece of Content Most people create a website or optimize their LinkedIn profile after selecting a niche. I prefer to take action and just start creating content. Using the process I\u2019m about to lay out, you\u2019ll be able to land your first client and then come back and optimize your LinkedIn profile and create a website. But landing your first client will give you the momentum you need to stay motivated. So, how do you get your first client? Instead of building a writing portfolio , create content for your dream client. Then, you\u2019ll send that piece of content to your dream client and give it to them to publish. This content could be a series of emails, a blog post, or a LinkedIn post. The key to making this approach work is to ensure that it\u2019s so unique and helpful that it makes them look like a true thoughtleader. And that can be hard. Ideally, create a unique piece of content with data. This data should answer a burning industry question. For example, a friend of mine wanted a new content marketing client. Her dream customer was an influencer marketing SaaS platform. Instead of just writing a generic post about influencer marketing, she studied every LinkedIn post Anthropic sponsored and then created a blog post highlighting insights from that data. For example, she identified that: Most of the sponsored posts underperformed the creator\u2019s average by about 26% Most of their creators were macro rather than micro creators Most creators were only hired for two sponsored posts These insights were previously unknown and are highly valuable to the influencer marketing community. So, when she gifted the blog post to a SaaS company, the company immediately hired her on a monthly retainer. She didn\u2019t have a fancy website or writing portfolio. The post was simply valuable enough to them and aligned with their goals, which made it a no-brainer to hire her on a monthly contract. Even if that client had turned her down, she could have pitched it to other competitors with influencer marketing platforms. The client also transformed the data into a LinkedIn post that performed very well: As you can see, this same data could also be used if you\u2019re trying to offer LinkedIn ghostwriting services. You could also use this data to offer email marketing services. In short, this data works for any type of content marketing because the insights from the data are interesting regardless of the form of content . So, how do you create a unique or interesting piece of data? How To Gather Interesting Data Many data studies exist, but most don\u2019t answer burning questions. For example, let\u2019s say the topic you\u2019re writing about is Linkedin influencer marketing. Here are some examples of statistics that don\u2019t help influencer marketers improve performance: 40% of consumers have a profile on LinkedIn More than half of LinkedIn\u2019s members\u2019 households earn over $100,000 There are more than 234 million members in the US alone On the other hand, these statistics from Anthropic\u2019s influencer marketing program would help an influencer marketer improve performance: Sponsored posts underperformed the creator\u2019s average by about 26% : The lesson is that you should underproject performance by about 26%. Most of their creators were macro rather than micro creators : The lesson here is that macro creators might be a better investment than micro creators if you have a B2C style product like Anthropic. Most creators were only hired for two sponsored posts : The lesson here is that the best deals aren\u2019t always doing long term partnerships with creators. To create interesting data studies that answer burning questions, use this prompt in a platform like ChatGPT: \u201c What are some hotly debated topics in (industry) where I could create a data study that would give (professionals) the insights they need to generate a better ROI from their (industry) efforts? \u201c Here\u2019s an example: ChatGPT also gives you some good ideas on how to collect the data. Generally, you can get a VA to use free or low-cost tools to comb through and collect the data. For example, in the LinkedIn influencer marketing data study, my friend used a free Chrome plugin called Creator Match to extract all of the data on the influencers they worked with: If you don\u2019t have time to manually collect the data, you can also use a VA on Upwork to gather the data for you. You can also ask ChatGPT for some recommendations on how to collect the data: Once you finish collecting the data, it\u2019s important to extract in",

      "content_text": "There\u2019s plenty of talk about the potential of AI, but how do you use it as a freelancer? There are two main use cases for AI for freelancers: Automate administrative tasks Grow your business (marketing) I tested many common AI use cases for freelancers and found that while the administrative tasks were fairly straightforward, the AI marketing use cases were a little trickier. Many marketing AI tools improve efficiency at the expense of quality, so I\u2019ll share the use cases I found most effective at improving efficiency while maintaining (or increasing) quality. I\u2019ll also share some administrative AI tools freelancers can use to operate more efficiently. Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1? Our Academy only costs one dollar to join for your first month. That means you can give it a try and learn a ton with zero risk. It was already the best place on the internet to learn content, copywriting, and online sales. Now it\u2019s extremely affordable to get in. We\u2019ll make it $300+ eventually, so get in at a dollar while you still can. Join Us For $1 Marketing AI For Freelancers #1. Automate Client Outreach Cold email is still an effective way to get new clients, but it needs to be personalized, deliver value, and target prospects who perfectly match your ideal client. While plenty of AI tools allow you to blast generic email tools, the most effective client outreach strategy I tested is using Apollo.io for lead research and combining it with Smartlead.ai to send the emails. To start, open up Apollo.io and create a Persona based on the job title, industry and keywords, location, and employee count. Then, it will give you a list of people who match that criteria. Now that you have a list of right-fit prospects, you can create and send an email. Apollo offers an AI tool that writes an email template for you based on your prospect\u2019s pain points and your solution. \u200b\u200bHowever, be careful when sending mass emails, as you can get your account flagged and banned. To be safe, start by sending no more than 20 weekly emails. I actually prefer to download the list of leads generated by Apollo and then upload it to Smartlead.ai, as Smartlead allows you to buy a completely new domain to avoid risking your primary domain and automates the email warmup process. While uploading the prospect list to Smartlead isn\u2019t as seamless as sending emails directly in Apollo\u2019s platform, it is much safer and still allows you to scale your outreach efficiently. Smartlead is known for its excellent email deliverability, so even though you can use other email platforms, it\u2019s one of the top rated solutions. Another option is to use a platform like Manus.ai to automate your prospecting and outreach process. Manus recently showed a case study of how a local marketer uploaded a detailed document outlining his ideal customer. Then, Manus used it to generate a list of prospects and automatically uploaded the list to an email automation tool: After confirming the campaign overview, it generated personalized landing pages for each prospect: Manus also wrote and sent all of the outreach messages. You can see a complete breakdown of the process in this video here: The drawback with Manus is that it is still in beta and hasn\u2019t been released publicly. You can also check out tools like Lindy.ai , though I found that their lead prospecting requests weren\u2019t always accurate (e.g., if you ask for B2B SaaS companies, some of the companies added to the list were B2C or ecommerce). AI agents like Lindy can be highly effective, but it takes time to learn how to use them. I ultimately found that using Apollo.io and Smartlead together produced the best results, even if it took a little more time. #2. Create a Website You don\u2019t need a website to be a successful freelancer, but it certainly makes you look more professional. If you want a simple one-page website (like a landing page), you can use a tool like Canva. They have plenty of landing page templates you can choose from to customize: While the templates are all pre-made and customizable through drag-and-drop features, you can generate your own videos, graphics, and images with Canva\u2019s AI generator, Magic Media. For example, I generated several Google Analytics graphics that I could add to my landing page: Then, you can connect it to your own domain name and publish: Canva also offers full website builders, but the features and flexibility are limited. Alternatively, you can use an AI website builder with more flexibility, like Wix . Wix\u2019s AI website builder starts with a chat interface that asks about your business and customers. Then, it generates a website based on your responses. Here\u2019s an example of the initial draft it generated for a marketing agency website: After generating the initial draft, you can ask it to tweak the theme, site structure, site description, or layout. For example, I didn\u2019t like the initial layout, so I asked it to generate a new one: Note that this website requires much more editing than a simple landing page, and I would rewrite a lot of the copy myself if I were to use this as a real website. Alternatively, you could select a template you already like, and then use Wix\u2019s AI writer to generate the copy for you. If you want a highly professional website, you can also look into Relume . Relume connects with Figma and is ideal for professional designers who are comfortable making websites but want to automate more of the design process. Here\u2019s an example of a Relume website: #3. Create and Optimize Blog Content Even if you don\u2019t have a website, you can still create blog content and post on other industry blogs to build credibility as a freelancer. For example, if you\u2019re in the SEO industry, you could pitch a blog to Ahrefs , Search Engine Journal , the Content Marketing Institute , or other industry leaders. Even if industry publications don\u2019t accept your blog post, you could post it on Medium or LinkedIn. There are several ways AI can help with this process. Content Ideation Most people use AI to discover keywords. Here\u2019s an example of how Eric Siu used Manus AI to analyze a competitor\u2019s high purchase intent keyword frameworks. You can then use these keyword frameworks and apply them to your business. In addition to doing keyword research, you can also use AI to help you craft thought leadership content. For example, creating data studies is one of the best ways to earn attention, shares, and backlinks. The key is creating a data study that answers a controversial or trending topic that gives marketers actionable insights to improve their strategy. So I took this data study from Kevin Indig, pasted it into ChatGPT, and then gave it the following prompt: Then, it gave me a handful of pretty excellent suggestions, like the idea of testing the prevalence of exact phrase matches in Google: You can then ask the LLM how to take action and actually capture the data. If you don\u2019t have access to proprietary data, you could hire a VA on Upwork to manually collect data or partner with a SaaS company that has data. For example, Brian Dean partnered with ClickFlow to analyze four million search results (they later refreshed the study and used the data from Semrush). So, rather than just using AI to generate content for you, use it to create a more interesting angle on a trending topic or generate data. Semantic Keywords There are also plenty of AI SEO tools that make it easy to optimize your blog content by including semantic (related) keywords. For example, tools like Surfer SEO give you a list of other semantic keywords to include in your blog post as you\u2019re writing: Surfer SEO also gives you a general content optimization score and even allows you to \u201cAuto Optimize\u201d the content. Auto optimization tools can be helpful, but double-check the AI\u2019s work as it isn\u2019t always accurate and may decrease the quality of the content itself. Internal Link Suggestions You can also get automated internal link suggestions using a tool like Surfer SEO: Tools like Link Whisper are designed to automate internal linking, though I\u2019ve found that tools that try to automate the entire internal linking process usually aren\u2019t entirely accurate. In my experience, it\u2019s still best to add internal links manually. Additionally, I don\u2019t recommend using AI to generate the content itself, as Google announced that AI generated content that shows little to no originality is considered \u201clowest quality.\u201d And, while informative content can rank and get people to your website, those readers won\u2019t remember you or buy your products/services if there is nothing memorable about your content. #4. Write Social Media Posts Building a personal brand on LinkedIn is an ideal strategy for freelancers to attract clients. There are plenty of AI writing tools to generate posts for you, but be sure to inject your own personal experience and data into the post to make it unique. For example, I used MagicPost to write a LinkedIn post for me: This would still require quite a bit of editing to make it publishable, so there are two other options. First, I could also choose the \u201cimport post template\u201d option. For example, if you see someone else write a productivity post, you could import that template and then amend the content itself to fit your productivity tips: In fact, you could make a list of some of the LinkedIn TopVoice experts and then make templates using their top performing posts. For example, I used Favikon , a B2B influencer marketing tool, to search for LinkedIn Top Voices. Then, you can make a list of these LinkedIn Top Voice accounts in a tool like Feedspot and then use their top performing posts as templates in MagicPost. The hook is also critical, so I used MagicPost\u2019s Hooks generator to create hooks for my posts: MagicPost can also repurpose blog content for you. For example, I had it create a LinkedIn post summarizing the blog post Kevin Indig wrote on SEJ regarding Google\u2019s AI overviews. The results were pr",

First, becoming a better copywriter doesn\u2019t mean you write more eloquently. In fact, the opposite is often true. Great copywriters are clear, concise, and ultimately convert readers into customers. So instead of focusing on improving the craft of writing more eloquently, focus on how to generate more revenue from your words. If you can prove that your copywriting can generate a higher ROI than the market average, you\u2019ll have a much more successful career as a copywriter. Keeping that in mind, here are my ten best pieces of advice to become a better copywriter. 1.) Talk to Customers Your job as a copywriter is to capture a potential customer\u2019s attention, build trust, introduce them to a solution, answer their objections, and ultimately convert them into a customer. To accomplish this goal, you need to understand the customers\u2019: Pain Points : What is compelling them to look for a solution? Objections : What are the most common concerns about the product or service? Language : Do they resonate with a professional or more casual style of writing? For example, if you look at Ramit Sethi\u2019s landing page for his course, Earnable, you\u2019ll see that he perfectly paints the picture his ideal customer currently faces. Instead of just saying \u201chere\u2019s how to make more money,\u201d he captures the reader\u2019s attention by mirroring the exact pain they currently experience (9-5 job, Netflix at night, weekend trips to Home Depot, endless scrolling on Instagram). Great copywriters deeply understand the exact situation prospects are experiencing and repeat it back to them, as this proves to the reader that you understand the pain of that reality. The more precisely you can paint the picture of their reality, the more effective you\u2019ll be at converting them because you\u2019re illustrating that this product is specifically designed for them. Ramit also dives into the specific objections a prospect may have. In fact, he even labeled them as \u201cscripts\u201d: Keep in mind that you can apply this concept to any form of copy, not just sales pages. For example, this ad from HubSpot highlights the pain point of sorting through endless data in a CRM: From a tactical standpoint, how do you actually talk to your customers? If you\u2019re working with a client, you might not realistically have time to talk to multiple customers before your work is due. In this case, ask if you can speak with their sales reps. Ask the sales reps to share the most common pain points and objections. Alternatively, if the client records sales calls, you can download the call recording transcripts, upload them to an AI tool like ChatGPT, and ask it to identify the most common pain points and objections. If the client doesn\u2019t have any sales data, at least visit Reddit and join Facebook communities to learn more about the pain points. For example, if you\u2019re writing for a weight loss program, go into a weight loss Reddit thread and learn everything you can about people buying similar programs. You can even copy and paste a bunch of the Reddit threads into ChatGPT and ask it questions like: What are the most common problems people run into when they start a weight loss program? What are the most common diets people use? If someone plateaus during a diet, what are the most common reasons cited? All of that information is valuable research you can incorporate into your copy. These communities also provide a better understanding of the tone of voice and language these people use. 2.) Learn From Your Competitors The leading competitors in your industry have likely already invested a significant amount of time and money in testing copy that works. Instead of starting from scratch, use their copy as a starting point to learn what works and what doesn\u2019t. I particularly like to use the LinkedIn or Facebook ads library as a starting point, because paid ads are easy to test, and you can see which ads ran the longest. In general, the longest running ads are the most effective and therefore likely feature a winning pain point. For example, here I can tell that this ad for Synthesia started running almost a month ago (Sept 2, 2025), and the main pain point they focus on is the pain of coordinating and executing shoots for training videos: Even if I\u2019m writing email copy or a sales page, I still use my competitors\u2019 paid ads to help me narrow down the most important pain points to discuss. Some of the pain points will be rather obvious, but you\u2019ll occasionally find some excellent gems. For example, this ad from Close illuminates that a key pain point of messy CRM data is that it leads to lost deals due to noisiness. This is very valuable pain point information that I can include in my copy. 3.) Create a Swipe File Similar to studying your competitors, you can also start a swipe file of the best copy that catches your attention. Inside the swipe file, save headlines, sales pages, and even ad copy that catches your attention. In addition to creating your own swipe file, I also recommend referencing SwipeFile.com , which is a website maintained by esteemed copywriter Neville Medhora. I find it helpful to look at copy that other esteemed copywriters value, as they often have a better eye for effective copy than a beginner copywriter (especially given that you\u2019re not necessarily the ideal customer for all advertisements). 4.) Establish a Writing Process As you become a better copywriter, you\u2019ll learn that copywriting is really the culmination of well placed pain points, objections, and CTAs. Creating a writing process is useful because it ensures you don\u2019t miss any steps required to construct effective copy. Your process will vary depending on the type of copy you\u2019ll write (e.g., email newsletter, blog post, sales page, etc.). For example, if I\u2019m writing copy for a blog post, this is the writing process I use: Customer research : When I\u2019m writing content for Copyblogger, I actually start by reading through the posts on Copyblogger Academy to learn what people are struggling with as those are the best topics. For example, I decided to write this post because a number of the group members stated they joined specifically to level up their copywriting skills: My Anti-Best Practice Angle : One of the problems with most SEO content is that it all sounds the same. So instead of giving best practice advice, I come up with a unique angle. For this post, I decided that while most people focus on the skill of becoming a better copywriter, I would focus on the angle of \u201chow can I build skills that make my copy drive more revenue?\u201d Write Using Real Examples and Experiences : The final step of my process is actually writing the content. However, instead of just providing theories, I find an example for each point I make and then provide action items. That\u2019s my entire blog writing process. It\u2019s short and simple, but it ensures each piece: Addresses the audience\u2019s pain points Speaks in a tone of voice that resonates with them. Provides unique value. Additionally, I never have to worry about staring at a blank page and facing writer\u2019s block. 5.) Practice Writing This might seem obvious, but the only way you can get better at writing is by practicing. However, instead of just writing more, here are some practical tips to practice writing productively: Schedule it into your calendar : Set aside 30 minutes in your calendar to write something each morning. Hold yourself accountable : Make a pact with a friend to share your writing with them each day. They don\u2019t have to read it, but it will keep you accountable. You can use a platform like stickK and stake money on it to really hold you accountable. Rewrite existing copy : Remember the swipe file from earlier? Instead of writing your own copy, rewrite (by hand) the stellar copy of other esteemed copywriters. This practice will help you internalize effective copywriting details. I also encourage you to write copy for your own products or services. For example, if you want to become a LinkedIn ghostwriter, start writing LinkedIn posts for yourself and grow your following. Writing your own LinkedIn posts will not only make you a better LinkedIn ghostwriter, but it will also help you understand what kind of content drives revenue (e.g., generates clients). If you can tie revenue to your copywriting, you\u2019ll be able to charge clients more. Additionally, you can use your own profile as a case study when pitching potential clients. If you want to be an SEO blog writer, you can start an affiliate marketing website in any niche and try to make your content rank in Google for specific keywords. Or, if you wanted to be a SaaS blog content writer, you could even vibe code a small tool using a platform like Loveable and then market and sell it. Another option is to start a dropshipping store. In fact, a friend of mine (who is now a six figure copywriter) began her journey as a copywriter by starting a dropshipping store selling cuckoo clocks. She began writing articles on how to repair cuckoo clocks, which generated calls from peo",
