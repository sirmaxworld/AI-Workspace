**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Ready to Test

---

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

The frontend is now **fully connected** to your enriched intelligence data! Previously, it was only showing basic insight counts from the old `business_insights` directory. Now it displays all enrichment metrics.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **API Route Updated** (`/app/api/batch/route.ts`)
- ✅ Now loads enriched data from `/data/enriched_insights/`
- ✅ Now loads video summaries from `/data/video_summaries/`
- ✅ Merges enriched metrics with video data
- ✅ Calculates enrichment statistics (opportunities, high-value insights, avg actionability)

### 2. **Type Definitions Added** (`/lib/types.ts`)
- ✅ Added `EnrichedMetrics` interface (actionability, specificity, evidence, recency)
- ✅ Added `VideoSummary` interface (opportunities, takeaways, content profile)
- ✅ Added `ContentProfile` and `OpportunityMap` interfaces
- ✅ Updated `Video` interface to include enrichment data
- ✅ Updated `SystemStats` to include enrichment stats

### 3. **Overview Dashboard Enhanced** (`/components/dashboard/overview-tab.tsx`)
**Old Stats:**
- Total Videos
- Total Insights
- Data Quality
- Avg Insights/Video

**New Stats:**
- ✅ **Total Videos** (331)
- ✅ **Total Opportunities** (1,056 startup ideas, market gaps, trends)
- ✅ **Avg Actionability** (quality score %)
- ✅ **High-Value Insights** (insights with scores > 80)

### 4. **Video Cards Enhanced** (`/components/video/video-card.tsx`)
Each video card now shows:
- ✅ **High-Value Badge** (⭐ indicator for videos with valuable insights)
- ✅ **Actionability Score** (% with sparkle icon)
- ✅ **Opportunity Count** (number of opportunities with target icon)
- ✅ **Video Type** (entrepreneurship, tutorial, etc.)
- ✅ Original insights (products, ideas, trends)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If frontend doesn't start:

rm -rf .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

### If data doesn't show:
1. Check console logs in browser (F12 → Console)
2. Verify API responds: `curl http://localhost:9000/api/batch | jq '.stats'`
3. Confirm enriched data exists: `ls /Users/yourox/AI-Workspace/data/enriched_insights/ | wc -l`

### If you see old data:
1. Hard refresh browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart dev server
