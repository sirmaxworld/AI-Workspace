## 📊 What Changed

### 1. Extraction Strategy ✅
**File:** `scripts/browserbase_transcript_extractor.py`

**New approach:**
```python
# Progressive scrolling + "Show more" button clicking
# Initial scroll to comments
page.evaluate("window.scrollTo(0, 800)")
time.sleep(2)

# Scroll to bottom and click "Show more" 5 times
for attempt in range(5):
    # Scroll to end of comments
    page.evaluate("""
        const comments = document.querySelector('ytd-comments#comments');
        if (comments) {
            comments.scrollIntoView({block: 'end', behavior: 'smooth'});
        }
    """)
    time.sleep(2)

    # Click continuation button
    continuation_button.click()
    time.sleep(2)
```

**Result:** Extracts ~73 comments (YouTube's progressive loading)

### 2. Engagement Distribution 📈

From test video (Rick Astley):
```
Total: 73 comments

Engagement Tiers:
  Mega (100K+ likes):    30 comments (41%)
  High (10K-100K):       25 comments (34%)
  Medium (1K-10K):        0 comments (0%)
  Low (<1K):             18 comments (25%)

Range:
  Highest: 1,000,000 likes (@Timeworks)
  Median:  81,000 likes
  Lowest:  1 like
```

**Analysis:** Excellent quality - 75% have 10K+ likes (high signal)

## 🎮 MCP Tools - Likes Filtering

### 1. Search High-Engagement Comments
```python
# Via MCP
search_validated_comments(
    query="education",
    min_likes=100000,  # Only mega-viral comments
    limit=20
)
```

**Returns:** Comments with 100K+ likes + business insights

### 2. Search Comment Insights by Engagement
```python
search_comment_insights(
    query="problem",
    insight_type="problem",
    min_engagement=50000,  # High-signal problems only
    limit=20
)
```

**Returns:** Problem insights from comments with 50K+ likes

### 3. Get User Problems (High-Signal)
```python
get_user_problems_from_comments(
    min_engagement=10000,  # Filter noise
    limit=20
)
```

**Returns:** User pain points from well-engaged comments

### 4. Search All Comments
```python
search_comment_insights(
    query="startup",
    insight_type="all",
    min_engagement=0,  # Include all
    limit=100
)
```

**Returns:** All comment insights, sorted by engagement

## 📈 Data Quality Improvement

### Before (20 comments):
- Top 20 highest-engagement comments
- High quality but limited coverage
- Average engagement: ~228K likes
- Limited diverse perspectives

### After (73 comments):
- Top 30 mega-viral (100K+)
- 25 high-engagement (10K-100K)
- 18 diverse/recent perspectives
- Average engagement: Still high (~150K top 50)
- **3.65x more data points** ✅

### Business Intelligence Value:
```
More comments = More insights:
  ✅ More use cases discovered
  ✅ More pain points identified
  ✅ Better trend detection (more data)
  ✅ More market validation signals
  ✅ Diverse audience perspectives (not just mega-viral)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

**1. scripts/browserbase_transcript_extractor.py**
- Lines 167-202: Updated comment loading strategy
- Progressive scrolling + "Show more" button clicking
- Debug output: Shows comment count found
- Result: ~73 comments extracted

**2. No MCP changes needed!**
- MCP server already handles likes via `engagement` field
- All filtering tools already work with likes metadata
- `search_validated_comments()` already filters by `min_likes`
- `search_comment_insights()` already filters by `min_engagement`

### Data Structure (Unchanged):
```json
{
  "comments": {
    "top_comments": [
      {
        "author": "@username",
        "text": "comment text",
        "likes": 397000  ← Likes metadata
      }
    ],
    "count": 73
  }
}
```

### BI Insights (Unchanged):
```json
{
  "comment_insights": [{
    "type": "problem",
    "insight": "...",
    "engagement": 397000,  ← Likes passed through
    "author": "@username"
  }],
  "top_validated_comments": [{
    "comment": "...",
    "likes": 397000,  ← Likes passed through
    "author": "@username"
  }]
}
```

video_ids = []

for f in sorted(transcript_dir.glob('*_full.json')):
    video_id = f.stem.replace('_full', '')
    with open(f) as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    # Skip if already has many comments
    if data.get('comments', {}).get('count', 0) < 50:
        video_ids.append(video_id)

print(' '.join(video_ids[:50]))
