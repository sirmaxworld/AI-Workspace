00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you could have a lot of people
 

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.230 align:start position:0%
maybe you could have a lot of people
more<00:08:43.839><c> or</c><00:08:44.000><c> less</c><00:08:44.240><c> like</c><00:08:44.399><c> a</c><00:08:44.560><c> a</c><00:08:44.880><c> mobile</c><00:08:45.279><c> workforce</c>

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
more or less like a a mobile workforce
 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.389 align:start position:0%

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
um entirely driven by the phone. And
 

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.230 align:start position:0%
um entirely driven by the phone. And
then<00:08:48.560><c> I</c><00:08:48.720><c> think</c><00:08:48.880><c> that's</c><00:08:49.519><c> that</c><00:08:49.760><c> happened</c><00:08:50.000><c> like</c>

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
then I think that's that happened like
 

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.550 align:start position:0%
then I think that's that happened like
sort<00:08:50.399><c> of</c><00:08:50.560><c> contemporaneously</c><00:08:51.519><c> to</c><00:08:52.000><c> Uber</c><00:08:52.399><c> with</c>

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
their black cars. But the funny thing
 

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
their black cars. But the funny thing
was,<00:08:54.800><c> and</c><00:08:55.040><c> maybe</c><00:08:55.279><c> this</c><00:08:55.760><c> rhymes</c><00:08:56.160><c> with</c><00:08:56.560><c> uh</c><00:08:57.120><c> the</c>

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
was, and maybe this rhymes with uh the
 

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.870 align:start position:0%

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know Bitcoin really very early on
 

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.710 align:start position:0%
you know Bitcoin really very early on
was<00:11:28.399><c> a</c><00:11:28.560><c> lot</c><00:11:28.640><c> more</c><00:11:28.880><c> Silk</c><00:11:29.200><c> Road</c><00:11:29.839><c> than</c><00:11:30.160><c> what</c><00:11:30.399><c> it</c><00:11:30.560><c> is</c>

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.470 align:start position:0%
today. So I actually think that Brian

illegal things or you know it's that you
 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.230 align:start position:0%
illegal things or you know it's that you
should<00:13:26.240><c> think</c><00:13:26.480><c> about</c><00:13:26.880><c> from</c><00:13:27.200><c> first</c><00:13:27.519><c> principles</c>

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
should think about from first principles
 

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.310 align:start position:0%
should think about from first principles
what<00:13:28.480><c> are</c><00:13:28.560><c> the</c><00:13:28.720><c> things</c><00:13:28.959><c> that</c><00:13:29.519><c> markets</c><00:13:30.000><c> and</c>

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
what are the things that markets and
 

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.670 align:start position:0%
what are the things that markets and

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and then I think basically ina in the
 

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.069 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and then I think basically ina in the
case<00:13:34.639><c> of</c><00:13:34.880><c> you</c><00:13:35.040><c> know</c><00:13:35.200><c> Uberx</c><00:13:35.920><c> and</c><00:13:37.360><c> uh</c><00:13:37.519><c> it</c><00:13:37.680><c> became</c>

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.870 align:start position:0%

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%

inside<00:13:57.040><c> San</c><00:13:57.279><c> Francisco</c><00:13:58.000><c> went</c><00:13:58.240><c> from</c><00:13:58.480><c> here</c><00:13:59.040><c> to</c>

00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
services literally made San Francisco
 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.949 align:start position:0%

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
10x more livable in a lot of ways. So
 

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
10x more livable in a lot of ways. So

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know I I think it's like don't just
 

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
you know I I think it's like don't just
run<00:14:20.800><c> out</c><00:14:20.959><c> and</c><00:14:21.199><c> do</c><00:14:21.519><c> illegal</c><00:14:21.839><c> things</c><00:14:22.079><c> like</c>

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's actually clearly net bad like
 

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
that's actually clearly net bad like
it's<00:14:24.880><c> more</c><00:14:25.360><c> what</c><00:14:25.600><c> are</c><00:14:25.760><c> things</c><00:14:26.000><c> that</c><00:14:26.480><c> uh</c><00:14:26.720><c> people</c>

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
it's more what are things that uh people
 

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.829 align:start position:0%
it's more what are things that uh people
users<00:14:27.920><c> want</c><00:14:28.399><c> and</c><00:14:28.639><c> then</c><00:14:29.040><c> thinking</c><00:14:29.360><c> from</c><00:14:29.600><c> first</c>

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about well what are the
 

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
thinking about well what are the

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
mitigate those things
 

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.829 align:start position:0%
mitigate those things
&gt;&gt; I<00:14:36.320><c> think</c><00:14:36.480><c> I</c><00:14:36.720><c> think</c><00:14:36.800><c> the</c><00:14:36.959><c> through</c><00:14:37.279><c> line</c><00:14:37.440><c> is</c><00:14:37.680><c> that</c>

00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think I think the through line is that
 

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:39.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think I think the through line is that

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
be one that's worth wondering if that's
 

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.390 align:start position:0%
be one that's worth wondering if that's

you want to basically transform sort of

you want to basically transform sort of

like neither investors nor founders
should<00:27:39.360><c> use</c><00:27:39.600><c> that</c><00:27:39.919><c> as</c><00:27:40.240><c> like</c><00:27:40.880><c> cross</c><00:27:41.120><c> it</c><00:27:41.279><c> off</c><00:27:41.440><c> the</c>

00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
be. I think that that's just a much
 

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
be. I think that that's just a much
better<00:32:14.399><c> way</c><00:32:14.559><c> to</c><00:32:14.720><c> think</c><00:32:14.880><c> about</c><00:32:15.039><c> it.</c><00:32:15.440><c> And</c><00:32:15.679><c> then</c>

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
better way to think about it. And then
 

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
better way to think about it. And then
the<00:32:16.159><c> the</c><00:32:16.559><c> difference</c><00:32:16.960><c> is</c><00:32:17.279><c> that</c><00:32:17.919><c> you</c><00:32:18.159><c> can't</c><00:32:18.480><c> sit</c>

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
the the difference is that you can't sit

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:39.269 align:start position:0%
meeting. I think Garrett sat and figured
out<00:32:37.200><c> that</c><00:32:37.440><c> he</c><00:32:37.600><c> needed</c><00:32:37.840><c> to</c><00:32:38.080><c> change</c><00:32:38.240><c> his</c><00:32:38.799><c> go</c><00:32:39.039><c> to</c>

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.710 align:start position:0%
probably looked at basically how do I

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
work backwards from my growth goal? And
 

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.029 align:start position:0%
work backwards from my growth goal? And
then<00:32:46.880><c> he</c><00:32:47.120><c> realized</c><00:32:47.600><c> that</c><00:32:48.399><c> uh</c><00:32:48.559><c> selling</c><00:32:48.799><c> in</c>

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
then he realized that uh selling in
 

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.310 align:start position:0%
then he realized that uh selling in

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:54.789 align:start position:0%
good enough. So one way or another, they
