00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
two years in advance. Uh because it's
 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.229 align:start position:0%

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
in the next few years. Maybe it's not
 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.110 align:start position:0%
in the next few years. Maybe it's not
two,<00:03:51.840><c> maybe</c><00:03:51.920><c> it's</c><00:03:52.159><c> three,</c><00:03:52.480><c> right?</c><00:03:52.720><c> But</c><00:03:52.879><c> I</c>

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
two, maybe it's three, right? But I
 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.630 align:start position:0%
two, maybe it's three, right? But I
think<00:03:53.200><c> you</c><00:03:53.360><c> should</c><00:03:53.519><c> be</c><00:03:53.680><c> planning</c><00:03:54.319><c> your</c>

company uh and your strategy around this
fact,<00:03:58.640><c> right?</c><00:03:59.439><c> And</c><00:03:59.840><c> like</c><00:04:00.159><c> there's</c><00:04:00.400><c> extreme</c>

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.830 align:start position:0%
fact, right? And like there's extreme

um what's the point of downloading an

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%

actually is the opposite. It's like
 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
actually is the opposite. It's like

question, but I think it might be

question, but I think it might be

even make apps anymore or is it is it
 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
even make apps anymore or is it is it

trust that that AI can do its job,
right?<00:08:03.440><c> And</c><00:08:03.599><c> obviously</c><00:08:03.919><c> right</c><00:08:04.080><c> now</c><00:08:04.240><c> AIS</c><00:08:04.639><c> are</c>

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
right? And obviously right now AIS are
 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.070 align:start position:0%
right? And obviously right now AIS are
not<00:08:05.039><c> trustable</c><00:08:05.520><c> enough</c><00:08:05.599><c> to</c><00:08:05.840><c> make</c><00:08:05.919><c> that</c>

will<00:21:18.240><c> improve</c><00:21:18.400><c> and</c><00:21:18.559><c> then</c><00:21:18.720><c> that</c><00:21:18.880><c> advantage</c>

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
problems. Uh but I think about what does
 

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
problems. Uh but I think about what does
it<00:22:05.440><c> mean</c><00:22:06.400><c> like</c><00:22:06.640><c> to</c><00:22:06.880><c> be</c><00:22:06.960><c> a</c><00:22:07.120><c> hard</c><00:22:07.280><c> problem.</c><00:22:07.520><c> Like</c>

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
it mean like to be a hard problem. Like
 

00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:09.909 align:start position:0%
it mean like to be a hard problem. Like
what's<00:22:07.919><c> going</c><00:22:08.000><c> to</c><00:22:08.080><c> be</c><00:22:08.240><c> hard</c><00:22:08.880><c> in</c><00:22:09.039><c> a</c><00:22:09.200><c> post</c><00:22:09.440><c> AGI</c>

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:12.230 align:start position:0%
what's going to be hard in a post AGI
world<00:22:10.559><c> and</c><00:22:10.799><c> I</c><00:22:10.960><c> think</c><00:22:11.520><c> a</c><00:22:11.760><c> lot</c><00:22:11.919><c> of</c><00:22:12.000><c> things</c>

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
world and I think a lot of things
 

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
world and I think a lot of things
actually<00:22:12.640><c> like</c><00:22:12.880><c> TSMC,</c><00:22:13.600><c> like</c><00:22:13.760><c> ASML,</c><00:22:14.320><c> those</c><00:22:14.559><c> are</c>

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
actually like TSMC, like ASML, those are
 

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
actually like TSMC, like ASML, those are
hard<00:22:14.960><c> problems</c><00:22:15.280><c> that</c><00:22:15.520><c> eventually</c><00:22:15.919><c> will</c><00:22:16.159><c> get</c>

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
hard problems that eventually will get
 

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.789 align:start position:0%
hard problems that eventually will get
easy<00:22:17.200><c> uh</c><00:22:17.280><c> with</c><00:22:17.520><c> robotics</c><00:22:18.080><c> etc.</c><00:22:18.400><c> But</c><00:22:18.480><c> robotics</c>

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
easy uh with robotics etc. But robotics
 

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:20.230 align:start position:0%
easy uh with robotics etc. But robotics
are<00:22:18.960><c> lagging</c><00:22:19.200><c> behind.</c><00:22:19.600><c> So</c><00:22:19.760><c> I</c><00:22:20.000><c> think</c><00:22:20.080><c> there's</c>

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
are lagging behind. So I think there's
 

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
are lagging behind. So I think there's
these<00:22:20.559><c> hard</c><00:22:20.720><c> problems</c><00:22:21.039><c> that</c><00:22:21.280><c> will</c><00:22:21.440><c> exist</c><00:22:21.919><c> even</c>

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
these hard problems that will exist even
 

00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:24.549 align:start position:0%
these hard problems that will exist even
in<00:22:22.320><c> two</c><00:22:22.559><c> years.</c><00:22:23.200><c> And</c><00:22:23.440><c> if</c><00:22:23.600><c> you're</c><00:22:23.840><c> willing</c><00:22:24.320><c> to</c>

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
in two years. And if you're willing to
 

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:26.470 align:start position:0%
in two years. And if you're willing to
go<00:22:24.720><c> after</c><00:22:25.039><c> hard</c><00:22:25.360><c> problems,</c><00:22:25.919><c> like</c><00:22:26.080><c> if</c><00:22:26.240><c> you</c><00:22:26.400><c> have</c>

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
go after hard problems, like if you have
 

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
go after hard problems, like if you have
the<00:22:26.640><c> guts</c><00:22:26.880><c> to</c><00:22:27.039><c> do</c><00:22:27.120><c> that,</c><00:22:27.600><c> then</c><00:22:27.840><c> you</c><00:22:28.000><c> can</c><00:22:28.080><c> have</c><00:22:28.240><c> a</c>

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
the guts to do that, then you can have a
 

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
the guts to do that, then you can have a

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
lens on everything, right? And it's like
 

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
lens on everything, right? And it's like
startup<00:35:15.839><c> mantra</c><00:35:16.160><c> is</c><00:35:16.320><c> that</c><00:35:16.480><c> users</c><00:35:16.800><c> don't</c><00:35:16.960><c> know</c>

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
startup mantra is that users don't know
 

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.310 align:start position:0%
startup mantra is that users don't know
what<00:35:17.200><c> they</c><00:35:17.280><c> want,</c><00:35:17.599><c> right?</c><00:35:17.920><c> And</c><00:35:18.160><c> I</c><00:35:18.240><c> think</c>

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
what they want, right? And I think
 

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
what they want, right? And I think
that's<00:35:18.560><c> true</c><00:35:18.720><c> to</c><00:35:18.880><c> a</c><00:35:19.040><c> large</c><00:35:19.200><c> extent,</c><00:35:19.520><c> right?</c>

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's true to a large extent, right?
 

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.270 align:start position:0%
that's true to a large extent, right?
But<00:35:19.839><c> I</c><00:35:20.000><c> think</c><00:35:20.079><c> users</c><00:35:20.400><c> still</c><00:35:20.560><c> have</c><00:35:20.800><c> values</c><00:35:21.040><c> and</c>

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
But I think users still have values and
 

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.190 align:start position:0%
But I think users still have values and
you<00:35:21.359><c> want</c><00:35:21.520><c> to</c><00:35:21.680><c> discover</c><00:35:22.000><c> those</c><00:35:22.240><c> values</c><00:35:22.560><c> and</c><00:35:22.880><c> be</c>

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
you want to discover those values and be
 

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.349 align:start position:0%
you want to discover those values and be
and<00:35:23.440><c> honor</c><00:35:23.760><c> them</c><00:35:24.000><c> to</c><00:35:24.240><c> some</c><00:35:24.480><c> extent,</c><00:35:24.800><c> right?</c><00:35:25.119><c> So</c>

00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
and honor them to some extent, right? So
 

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
and honor them to some extent, right? So
I<00:35:25.520><c> think</c><00:35:25.599><c> like</c><00:35:25.760><c> something</c><00:35:26.000><c> that's</c><00:35:26.160><c> top</c><00:35:26.320><c> of</c>

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
I think like something that's top of

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we're never going to blow smoke up
 

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.270 align:start position:0%
that we're never going to blow smoke up
your<00:36:05.839><c> ass.</c><00:36:06.400><c> Uh</c><00:36:06.640><c> we're</c><00:36:06.800><c> only</c><00:36:06.960><c> going</c><00:36:07.040><c> to</c><00:36:07.200><c> tell</c>

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
your ass. Uh we're only going to tell
 

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
your ass. Uh we're only going to tell
you<00:36:07.599><c> if</c><00:36:07.839><c> we</c><00:36:08.000><c> like</c><00:36:08.160><c> something</c><00:36:08.400><c> or</c><00:36:08.560><c> if</c><00:36:08.640><c> an</c><00:36:08.800><c> idea</c>

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
you if we like something or if an idea
 

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.109 align:start position:0%
you if we like something or if an idea
is<00:36:09.280><c> good,</c><00:36:09.440><c> if</c><00:36:09.680><c> it</c><00:36:09.839><c> really</c><00:36:10.000><c> is.</c><00:36:10.640><c> Uh</c><00:36:10.800><c> and</c><00:36:10.960><c> the</c>

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
is good, if it really is. Uh and the
 

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
is good, if it really is. Uh and the
other<00:36:11.280><c> principle</c><00:36:11.680><c> is</c><00:36:12.400><c> actually</c><00:36:12.800><c> we're</c><00:36:12.960><c> just</c>

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
other principle is actually we're just
 

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.310 align:start position:0%
other principle is actually we're just
going<00:36:13.119><c> to</c><00:36:13.280><c> like,</c><00:36:13.920><c> you</c><00:36:14.000><c> know,</c><00:36:14.079><c> we're</c><00:36:14.240><c> just</c>

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
going to like, you know, we're just
 

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.430 align:start position:0%
going to like, you know, we're just

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
going to glaze you all day. Like that's
 

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.870 align:start position:0%
going to glaze you all day. Like that's
what<00:36:15.599><c> we're</c><00:36:15.760><c> going</c><00:36:15.839><c> to</c><00:36:15.920><c> do.</c><00:36:16.160><c> If</c><00:36:16.400><c> you</c><00:36:16.480><c> ask</c><00:36:16.640><c> the</c>

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do. If you ask the
 

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.710 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do. If you ask the
user<00:36:17.119><c> which</c><00:36:17.359><c> principle</c><00:36:17.680><c> do</c><00:36:17.839><c> they</c><00:36:18.000><c> want,</c>

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
user which principle do they want,
 

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.990 align:start position:0%
user which principle do they want,
almost<00:36:19.040><c> everyone's</c><00:36:19.359><c> going</c><00:36:19.440><c> to</c><00:36:19.520><c> say</c><00:36:19.680><c> the</c><00:36:19.839><c> first</c>

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
almost everyone's going to say the first
 

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.950 align:start position:0%
almost everyone's going to say the first
one,<00:36:20.240><c> right?</c><00:36:20.800><c> So,</c><00:36:21.040><c> I</c><00:36:21.280><c> I</c><00:36:21.359><c> I</c><00:36:21.760><c> think</c><00:36:22.560><c> doing</c><00:36:22.800><c> what</c>

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
one, right? So, I I I think doing what
 

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
one, right? So, I I I think doing what
the<00:36:23.200><c> user</c><00:36:23.440><c> wants,</c><00:36:24.000><c> you</c><00:36:24.240><c> you</c><00:36:24.480><c> get</c><00:36:24.640><c> to</c><00:36:24.720><c> a</c>

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
the user wants, you you get to a
 

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.230 align:start position:0%
the user wants, you you get to a
different<00:36:25.040><c> answer</c><00:36:25.359><c> depending</c><00:36:25.599><c> on</c><00:36:25.760><c> what</c><00:36:26.000><c> level</c>

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
different answer depending on what level
 

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
different answer depending on what level
of<00:36:26.400><c> the</c><00:36:26.560><c> engagement</c><00:36:26.960><c> you're</c><00:36:27.200><c> asking</c><00:36:27.440><c> them.</c>

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the engagement you're asking them.
 

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.190 align:start position:0%
of the engagement you're asking them.
And<00:36:28.320><c> I</c><00:36:28.480><c> think</c><00:36:28.560><c> that's</c><00:36:28.800><c> really</c><00:36:28.960><c> important</c>

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
And I think that's really important
 

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.270 align:start position:0%
And I think that's really important
because<00:36:29.520><c> people</c><00:36:29.760><c> can</c><00:36:29.920><c> abuse</c><00:36:30.320><c> that</c><00:36:30.800><c> to</c><00:36:31.119><c> their</c>

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
because people can abuse that to their
 

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.430 align:start position:0%
because people can abuse that to their
advantage<00:36:31.760><c> by</c><00:36:32.320><c> only</c><00:36:32.640><c> asking</c><00:36:32.880><c> the</c><00:36:33.040><c> user</c><00:36:33.280><c> the</c>

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
advantage by only asking the user the
 

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.109 align:start position:0%
advantage by only asking the user the

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
question in certain ways, right? And I
 

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:37.109 align:start position:0%
question in certain ways, right? And I
think<00:36:35.680><c> you</c><00:36:35.920><c> need</c><00:36:36.000><c> to</c><00:36:36.240><c> really</c><00:36:36.480><c> ask</c><00:36:36.720><c> yourself</c>

00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
think you need to really ask yourself
 

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.470 align:start position:0%
think you need to really ask yourself
what<00:36:37.440><c> what's</c><00:36:37.760><c> the</c><00:36:37.839><c> right</c><00:36:38.000><c> way</c><00:36:38.079><c> to</c><00:36:38.240><c> ask</c><00:36:38.320><c> the</c>
