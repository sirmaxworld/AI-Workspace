00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.229 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Transportation is the largest sector of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles with carbon capture? Why don't
 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
vehicles with carbon capture? Why don't
we<00:02:59.440><c> extract</c><00:02:59.840><c> and</c><00:03:00.000><c> purify</c><00:03:00.400><c> some</c><00:03:00.560><c> of</c><00:03:00.640><c> the</c><00:03:00.800><c> CO2</c>

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
we extract and purify some of the CO2
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.270 align:start position:0%
we extract and purify some of the CO2

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
with processing air is that you have to
 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.469 align:start position:0%
with processing air is that you have to

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
use a lot more energy to pull CO2 out.
 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.270 align:start position:0%
use a lot more energy to pull CO2 out.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.909 align:start position:0%
So it ends up being far more expensive

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
way I think about YC is it's like going
 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.909 align:start position:0%
way I think about YC is it's like going

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
running really fast. And so what it did
 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
running really fast. And so what it did
is<00:06:03.280><c> YC</c><00:06:03.840><c> set</c><00:06:04.000><c> the</c><00:06:04.240><c> pace</c><00:06:04.400><c> for</c><00:06:04.639><c> us</c><00:06:04.960><c> right</c><00:06:05.120><c> at</c><00:06:05.360><c> the</c>

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
is YC set the pace for us right at the
 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
is YC set the pace for us right at the
beginning.<00:06:06.080><c> So</c><00:06:06.240><c> we</c><00:06:06.479><c> knew</c><00:06:06.639><c> that,</c><00:06:07.039><c> okay,</c><00:06:07.360><c> this</c>

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
beginning. So we knew that, okay, this
 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.270 align:start position:0%
beginning. So we knew that, okay, this
is<00:06:07.680><c> what</c><00:06:07.840><c> world</c><00:06:08.160><c> class</c><00:06:08.479><c> looks</c><00:06:08.720><c> like.</c><00:06:08.960><c> You</c><00:06:09.199><c> have</c>

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
is what world class looks like. You have
 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.350 align:start position:0%
is what world class looks like. You have
to<00:06:09.360><c> move</c><00:06:09.520><c> at</c><00:06:09.759><c> this</c><00:06:09.919><c> speed</c><00:06:10.160><c> and</c><00:06:10.720><c> take</c><00:06:11.039><c> risks</c>

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
to move at this speed and take risks
 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.110 align:start position:0%
to move at this speed and take risks
that<00:06:11.600><c> maybe</c><00:06:11.840><c> others</c><00:06:12.160><c> wouldn't.</c><00:06:12.720><c> And</c><00:06:12.880><c> I</c><00:06:13.039><c> think</c>

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe others wouldn't. And I think
 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
that maybe others wouldn't. And I think
if<00:06:13.280><c> we</c><00:06:13.360><c> had</c><00:06:13.520><c> done</c><00:06:13.680><c> YC</c><00:06:14.160><c> later</c><00:06:14.400><c> in</c><00:06:14.639><c> the</c><00:06:14.800><c> process,</c>

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
if we had done YC later in the process,
 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.189 align:start position:0%
if we had done YC later in the process,
we<00:06:15.520><c> would</c><00:06:15.680><c> have</c><00:06:15.840><c> already</c><00:06:16.080><c> baked</c><00:06:16.400><c> in</c><00:06:16.639><c> a</c><00:06:16.880><c> slower</c>

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
we would have already baked in a slower
 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
we would have already baked in a slower
speed<00:06:17.680><c> and</c><00:06:17.919><c> it</c><00:06:18.080><c> would</c><00:06:18.160><c> have</c><00:06:18.319><c> been</c><00:06:18.479><c> harder</c><00:06:18.720><c> to</c>

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
speed and it would have been harder to
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.469 align:start position:0%
speed and it would have been harder to
change<00:06:19.120><c> at</c><00:06:19.280><c> that</c><00:06:19.440><c> point.</c>

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
change at that point.
 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
change at that point.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Though Remora started gaining momentum

in the Bay Area at YC, Paul and his

in the Bay Area at YC, Paul and his

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So we are in Wixom 30 minutes outside of
 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So we are in Wixom 30 minutes outside of

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%

are not going to get there. So what we

are not going to get there. So what we

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
our production process and then create a

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.269 align:start position:0%

the highway with a full load. It could
 

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.430 align:start position:0%
the highway with a full load. It could

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
And that allows us to test with
 

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
And that allows us to test with
