# Browserbase Session Timeout Fix

## Problem Identified

During parallel batch extraction of 50 videos, **22.6% of comment extractions failed** with error:
```
"Target page, context or browser has been closed"
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Browserbase Default Timeout**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
2. **Average Video Processing Time**: ~250-320 seconds
3. **Long Videos**: Some transcripts with 600+ segments took >5 minutes
4. **Session Closure**: Browserbase automatically closed sessions after timeout, causing comment extraction to fail

### Error Pattern

- **Total videos processed**: 31
- **Comment extraction errors**: 7 (22.6%)
- **Successful extractions**: 22 (71.0%)
- **Failures**: 1 (no transcript button)

**Failed videos** (session timeout):
- 3Zvk4AMCrG8, A8uAl1wiJBA, Px_X-qBQ18M, VfwIpD5D-JM, ZvZ4aUXBtzU, Xq0xJl-2D_s

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended Session Timeout (browserbase_transcript_extractor.py:41-48)

**Before:**
```python
# Create a session
session = bb.sessions.create(project_id=project_id)
session_id = session.id
```

**After:**
```python
# Create a session with extended timeout (10 minutes for long videos)
session = bb.sessions.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    timeout=600  # 10 minutes in seconds
)
session_id = session.id

print(f"✅ Session created: {session_id} (timeout: 10min)")
```

**Impact**: Doubles available session time from 5 to 10 minutes

### 2. Page Alive Checks (browserbase_transcript_extractor.py:174-248)

Added defensive checks before each page operation:

```python
# Check if page is still alive before comment extraction
if page.is_closed():
    print(f"⚠️  Page closed before comment extraction")
    comments = []
else:
    # Proceed with comment extraction

    # Check page still alive before each scroll
    for attempt in range(3):
        if page.is_closed():
            print(f"  ⚠️  Page closed during scroll attempt {attempt + 1}")
            break
        # ... scroll logic

    # Check before final extraction
    if not page.is_closed():
        all_comments = page.locator('ytd-comment-thread-renderer').all()
        # ... extract comments
```

**Impact**: Gracefully handles session closures without crashing

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

**Before:**
```python
try:
    # comment extraction
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️  Could not extract comments: {e}")
    comments = []
```

**After:**
```python
try:
    # Page alive checks + comment extraction
except Exception as scroll_error:
    print(f"  ⚠️  Scroll attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {scroll_error}")
    break
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️  Could not extract comments: {e}")
    comments = []
```

**Impact**: Better error messages for debugging

## Expected Improvement

### Current Performance (with timeouts)
- **Success rate**: 71%
- **Failed extractions**: 22.6%
- **Average comments/video**: ~20

### Expected Performance (with fix)
- **Success rate**: ~95%+
- **Failed extractions**: <5%
- **Average comments/video**: ~25-30

### Why Some Failures Are Expected

1. **YouTube UI Changes**: Transcript button location changes
2. **Disabled Comments**: Some videos have comments disabled
3. **Network Issues**: Occasional connection problems
4. **Rate Limiting**: YouTube may throttle requests

---

## Testing Recommendations

### For Next Batch Extraction

1. **Monitor first 10 videos** for timeout warnings
2. **Check session duration** in logs
3. **Verify comment counts** match expected ranges
4. **Review error messages** for new patterns

### Success Metrics

✅ **No "page closed" errors** during comment extraction
✅ **90%+ videos** extract comments successfully
✅ **Average 25-30 comments** per video
✅ **Session timeout warnings** in logs if approaching limit

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Retry Logic
**Pro**: Automatic recovery
**Con**: Increases total time by 2-3x
**Decision**: Not implemented (timeout fix sufficient)

### Option 2: Separate Sessions for Comments
**Pro**: Independent timeouts
**Con**: 2x Browserbase cost
**Decision**: Not implemented (too expensive)

### Option 3: Reduce Comment Scrolling
**Pro**: Faster extraction
**Con**: Fewer comments (lower data quality)
**Decision**: Not implemented (already optimized to 3 scrolls)

---

## Cost Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Session timeout: 5 minutes
- Cost per video: $0.0242
- Total cost (50 videos): $1.21

**After Fix:**
- Session timeout: 10 minutes
- Cost per video: $0.0242 (same, only using ~3-5 min)
- Total cost (50 videos): $1.21

**No additional cost** - sessions only charged for actual usage time, not timeout duration.

## File Changes

### Modified Files
1. `browserbase_transcript_extractor.py`
   - Lines 41-48: Extended timeout to 600 seconds
   - Lines 174-248: Added page.is_closed() checks

### No Changes Required
- `batch_extract_videos.py` - Parallel processing unchanged
- `business_intelligence_extractor.py` - Unchanged

---

## Deployment

### For Current Extraction
- **Status**: Currently running with OLD code
- **Impact**: Will complete with ~22% comment failures
- **Action**: Let finish, then re-run failed videos

### For Future Extractions
- **Status**: Fix applied and ready
- **Testing**: Test on 2-3 videos first
- **Rollout**: Use for all future batch extractions

---

## Summary

**Problem**: 22.6% of comment extractions failing due to 5-minute session timeout
**Solution**: Extended timeout to 10 minutes + page alive checks
**Impact**: Expected success rate improvement from 71% → 95%+
**Cost**: No additional cost
**Risk**: Low - graceful fallbacks for any failures

**Recommendation**: Apply fix to all future extractions. Current extraction can complete as-is, then re-run the 7 failed videos with new code.
